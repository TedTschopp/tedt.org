                <h2><a id="The_Radioactivists_34"></a>The Radioactivists / Children of the Glow / Order of the Searing Light</h2>
                <p>Open to mutants, manimals, and plantients, but primarily composed of mutants, the Children of the Glow worship radiation as the divine personification of Fate. Members of this Archaic Alignment consider “The Glow” to be the “Great Changer of Life,” and as such, its influence is always to be sought out and its judgments (in the form of granting and taking away mutations) respected as the holy will of the Universe. Members of the Children of the Glow also do not use, nor tolerate the use of, the term “defect.” They believe that all mutations are granted by divine mandate and are therefor beneficial, even if their benefit is not immediately understood. Status within this Archaic Alignment is based upon the number of mutations carried by an individual, with the more numerous and more bizarre mutations granting higher rank.</p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Membership is granted to any like-minded mutant, manimal, or plantient. Applicants must undergo a trial consisting of spending one week in a known radioactive area and surviving the experience, proving the devotion and piety of that individual’s belief in “The Glow.”</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Members add +5 to all mutation check rolls, or when gaining a new passive mutation or defect. </p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> Hands held clasped in opposite facing directions and held against the chest followed by a short bow; referring to another member as being “in The Glow.”</p>
                <h2><a id="The_Chosen_Zuu_34"></a>The Chosen Zuu</h2>
                <p>Open only to manimals, The Chosen Zuu are nonetheless an egalitarian group that generally cooperate with other genotypes. This is because a core belief of The Chosen Zuu is that even though humanity’s time in the world is obviously waning, they are still owed the respect one would give an elderly parent. This sentiment is based upon a long-standing oral tradition among The Chosen Zuu that they owe their very existence to an Ancient One named Dr. Thadeus Hanhuman, creator of the holy substance known as Cortexin. It is said that just prior to the Great Disaster, Dr. Hanhuman lived in the fabled land of Washington Zuu, and it was there that he gave his Cortexin elixir to all the animals living there, first enabling them to stand upright and to speak.  Zoopremisists and The Chosen Zuu are often mistaken for each other due to the alignment of the philosophy by neophyes.  Most Chosen see Zoopremisists as extremists and do not appreciate the association.  Many are worried that radicalization of the Chosen would swell the ranks of the Zoopremisists.   </p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Membership is open to any like-believing manimals, regardless of species or mutations.</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Merit-based rank in a para-military organization that is universally recognized among all alignment members; shared material resources and intelligence among members and allies.</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b>Clenched right paw brought to the upper-left torso, striking the chest twice, also used as a salute to superior officers.</p>
                <h2><a id="Brotherhood_Of_Thought_8"></a>Brotherhood Of Thought / The Clan of Cognition</h2>
                <p>This group was founded by a biochemist, Ashintin, who survived the holocaust. He gathered a small group of followers, and their goals were to unify all intelligent creatures in a world of enlightened coexistence and freedom of choice.  Once this first community was founded, Ashintin left that community with a manimal, plantient, mutant, and a robot.  They traveled the world founding other communities until finally disappearing into legend.  </p>
				<p>The Brotherhood is an outgrowth of older monastic and institutional education traditions, and its members live lives of learning, service, and preaching. It was first formed by a biochemist, Ashintin, who survived the holocaust, who wrote the Book of Thought. In this tome, the Ashintin describes a journey of a pilgrim who gains an understanding that non-human (animal and plant) mutations often had mental abilities equal to or greater than humans.  Once the pilgrim had come to this conclusion the book describes a dialog between the pilgrim and an unnamed interlocutor addressing the questions and answer on topics regarding the nature of artificial intelligence, the debilitating effects of technology on the spirit, and the diversity of sentient life in all the forms it has grown into. Ashintin never speaks of himself in these books, never says where his ideas come from or why he believes them to be important. What he does do is conclude that thought, the ability for thought and the quality of thought, must be the only benchmarks by which the value of any creature can be judged. Though no one knows where the Ashintin went or how he died, copies of the book found their way into many communities and sparked a new religion.</p>
				<p>Though different translations of the Book of Thought vary somewhat, they all come to two basic conclusions. First, any mind able to ponder its own consciousness is sentient, and thus a brother in the community of sapient creatures. Second, no thinking creature is more important than any other, and therefore no creature can claim its choices are more valid than any other’s. This is one of the basic tenets of the Brotherhood, and it results in a chaotic mix of members, each doing what she believes the Book encourages. Since all these opinions are considered equally valid, the Brotherhood continues to splinter into factions with very different views.</p>
				<p>The one universal among the factions is their acceptance of any creature who truly wishes to join. Many small monasteries exist where younger Brothers are taught and older ones retire. The rest of the Brothers spend their lives spreading the word of universal sentience as they feel best. Many travel in groups that include human, mutant and animal members — and even androids and AIs if any can be found. Since thought is a product of the mind, and the minds of animals, computers and men are different, Brothers believe they must travel in diverse groups in order to experience and explore diverse qualities of thought.</p>
				<p>Because of the diversity of opinions regarding Ashintin and The Book of Thought, most members of the Brotherhood do not form exclusive communities, instead wandering in groups of 5 to 6 or settling in groups of 30 to 50 as part of larger communities. The rare Brotherhood strongholds most commonly settle become monastic in their operations and as they grow they become anarchy-ridden and lose Brotherhood unity.  At this point they tend to break apart and become generic societies with several Brotherhood factions within them.  It is at this point the members tend to call themselves the Clan of Cognition or The Clan of Cog for short.  In general the two names can be used interchangeably.  Generally speaking, when referring to one monastic group that is unified in theology and method, that group is called A Brother of Thought.  Several Brotherhoods together are called the Clan of Cognition. </p>
				<p>The Brotherhood is open and welcoming to anyone who is not overtly violent or bigoted, making their communities good neutral ground for opposing factions to meet peacefully when negotiating. Those who are seen as friends of unity can depend on the Brotherhood for advice and research, drawing on the broad range of knowledge and expertise found within the Brotherhood.  Foes of the Brotherhood, in addition to risking a visit from the Censors ( black-clad killers who use stealth, poison and sabotage to cripple and kill enemies of universal brotherhood using powerful mental abilities), face a campaign of bad publicity spread by wandering Brotherhood members. Such maligned individuals find they are seen as smallminded and idiotic by anyone who has been visited by a Brother, making it difficult for them to find allies or maintain occupied lands.<p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> All sentient intelligences are accepted.</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Members of the Brotherhood of Thought are generally accepted by most open minded Archaic Alignments.  They many travel safely through these territories and invoke Clan hospitality with other clan members and tribes.</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> In dangerous or populated areas, they use a secret sign to contact each other. This sign is a tracing of the infinity symbol or circle across the forehead as though casually brushing hair.  In open and safe areas the brotherhood will wear head and arm bands with the infinity symbol inside a circle on it. </p>
                <h2><a id="The_Atomic_Equinox_8"></a>The Atomic Equinox</h2>
                <p>Open to all plantients, and to select members of other genotypes, The Atomic Equinox is a stoic society of plantients that believe all animal life (including sentients) are primarily useful as a necessary and ongoing source of carbon-dioxide. While not hostile by nature, members of The Atomic Equinox will not hesitate to react with force to any perceived harm to plant life in general or to the ecosystem as a whole. The Atomic Equinox sometimes allow members of other genotypes to join as special “Warders” to assist them with their primary task of care-taking the natural environment. This archaic alignment is sometimes referred to by outsiders as “the tree-huggers who hug back.” </p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Membership is open to any like-believing plantient, and to select pure strain humans, mutants, and manimals who may serve the greater good.</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Members cannot become lost in any wilderness area containing plants; members are likewise readily able to locate sources of fresh water.</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> Both hands or prehensile appendages brought together cupped with fingers spread, to form the shape of a flower.</p>
                <h2><a id="Seekers_12"></a>Seekers</h2>
                <p>The Seekers are a group of humans and mutants that all appear completely human. They travel and work in large populated areas, trying to get humans and mutants of all types to work together. They consider mutated animals to be inferior, but don’t press the issue, and sometimes even accept their help.</p>
                <p>Seekers have turned their back on the gifts of the past.  According to their beliefs, the toys and gadgets that were supposed to improve life were instead the instruments of humanities demise.  A thriving society must learn to survive without the trappings of technology.  Seekers build communities that have nothing to so with the relics of the previous age.  Water is from a well, butter is churned and children are read their books by candlelight after it gets dark.  Farmers plow the land with horses and defend their lands with muskets and cannons.  Seekers view machinery with great loathing.  Occasionally, bands of villagers will lead raids to destroy the technology used by other communities.  This zealous hatred doesn't endear other villages to their neighbors.  Seekers are antagonistic towards wish to restore the evils of a previous age.  They find those who wish to worship the artifacts of that previous to be pitied in the best of cases and in worst cases liberated.
                <p>They can be found among other human factions, or by themselves. The membership is usually very rich, in terms of the local means of exchange. </p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Mutants that appear to be PSH as well as PSH. They do not allow Manimals or Plantients or Robotic characters.</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Before each mission that starts in an area with Seekers, the player will receive a stipend in local currency to be spent locally as the player sees fit on items found on Table 1-4 or similar.  If there is any money left, the player is expected to return any excess money to the local chapter house for distribution later.  It is unheard of Seekers who abscond with this money as they are never heard from again and their names are forbidden to be spoken.  Additionally any item from Table 1-4 the characters began the game with is considered to be of fine manufacture and made specifically for the players.  This means that each item does an additional 2 die of damage or has +2 additional AC.  Additionally any equipment that is not from Tech Level 3 and below will receive these bonuses if they can return to a Seeker Chapter House and have them worked on for a month.  A Seeker does not have the ability to use Ancient Artifacts.  If willfully uses such technology, he suffers -2 dice and -2 AC from the equipment.  Also, it takes at least one additional action to complete any activity.  If this use of forbidden technology gets back to a chapter house or community, than punishment will be swift and an example will be made to the whole community.</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> Their secret sign consists of scanning the horizon using both hands to shade the eyes.</p>
                <h2><a id="Restorationists_20"></a>Restorationists</h2>
                <p>The Restorationists are one of the more powerful and common of the cryptic alliances. They are also among the most mistrusted. The Restorationists don’t accept that the Final Wars ended the age of a better world through technology, and intend to reclaim the glories and powers humanity held a few short generations ago. Their driving goals are to rebuild the best of the past civilizations, while learning from the mistakes that ended them.</p>
				<p>The Restorations don’t just wish to build a new future, they want to recreate the world as it was, only better. Though this rings hollow with many, the Restorationists assure any who listen that it is not an impossible goal. The height of technology in the previous era could almost literally mold reality as its masters desired. The Restorationists firmly believe that if that technology could be rebuilt and controlled, it could rebuild cities, end plagues, cleanse irradiated lands and end the thousand other threats. The natural corollary of this belief is that no damage done in the quest to regain these powers is unacceptable. Anything done now can be fixed later, once the Restorationists have the needed tools. The only excesses the Restorations worry about are those that might destroy the organization before it gains the needed technologies.</p>
				<p>Some of the most powerful and advanced enclaves still functioning are run by Restorationists, and many more depend on Restorationist technologies to keep things running. The Restorationists have a tech base as high as any group, though their abilities still fall well short of those possessed before the Final Wars. To maintain and advance this capacity, Restorationists regularly raid old ruins and explore wilderness areas, or pay mercenary companies to do so. Anything of a technological nature, even junk, can be sold to a Restorationist stronghold, though obviously functioning devices bring a much higher price. Restorationists don’t ask where these things come from, and it’s not unusual for them to buy artifacts stolen from Archivists or taken in a bloody raid.</p>
				<p>Most Restorationists are pure-strain humans, though the organization has no official bias against mutants or non-human bloodlines. In many way the reverse is more common: Creatures other than pure-strain humans have little interest in restoring the civilizations of the past. Such creatures either didn’t exist in that age, or were second-class citizens at best, so few have any desire to see the world return to that time. Many of the pro-animal and pro-mutant groups see the Restorationists as fanatics, and treat Restorationist agents poorly.</p>
				<p>The Restorationists feel that renegade AIs, especially networks of AIs, were responsible for the Final Wars. In fact, they blame the vast numbers of nonhuman intelligences for all the errors of the last generation before the Wars. As a result, Restorationists believe all computers must be programmed to obey humans in general and specific operators in particular. They also believe computers must be designed to do their best to act in humans’ best interests, as the computers believe humans would define them. Though this leads to computers doing things they believe unwise because it is what they think the humans would want, the Restorationists consider this an acceptable risk to prevent computers from taking control. Only a few AIs in Restorationist hands have had such programming, with mixed results, but the organization’s computer techs continue to develop more complex and effective control routines.</p>
				<p>The Restorationists do have a few allies. Healers frequently work with them to recreate medical technologies. Many groups that support order and peace work with Restorationists on specific projects, but in general organizations mistrust Restorationists desires to control everything they have a hand in building. More than one community has asked for Restorationist help, only to discover too late that the help comes with many strings attached.</p>
				<p>Restorationist cities are usually highly populated. Their dependence on high tech allows them to make do with much less farming land than other groups, but they have a constant demand for power. This, combined with a limited supply of high tech, prevents their cities from becoming sprawls. Smaller Restorationist communities often make enemies faster than friends, and risk being eliminated by coalitions of their neighbors. A strong Restorationist leader can hold together a smaller town through constant vigilance, blackmail and extortion, but such towns often disappear quickly when their leaders fall.</p>
				<p>Restorationists make strong allies and fearsome foes. They have a higher tech base, and a better ability to maintain it, than any other large group. For friends, they provide a market for high tech, repair facilities and often extensive creature comforts. To foes they present a serious threat, able to bring weapons of the Final Wars down on opposing cities. In both cases the limiting factor is a lack of stability. Restorationists change friends and opponents whenever it seems to move them closer to their ultimate goals, giving them a reputation as untrustworthy. This is coupled with the fact that they often run out of technological solutions without warning, often leaving allies stranded or enemies with a sudden reprieve.</p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Open to all sentient creatures except Shaman.  </p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Characters who have this allegiance can expect to receive scrap goods and spare parts as trading materials, items useful to high-tech groups to maintain their ancient machines. A member who takes an artifact back to a Restorationist facility, receives bonuses(up to +10 for major facilities) to the artifact check roll based on the size of the facility.   </p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> Members of the Restorationists will draw a cross or an ankh on the back of their hand with their middle finger while clasping their hands together.</p>
                <h2><a id="The_Holy_Medicinal_Order_20"></a>The Holy Medicinal Order</h2>
                <p>The Holy Medicinal Order is a monastic order comprised of all genotypes. While their members maintain a series of remote monasteries (which are universally acknowledged by all genotypes and archaic alignments as neutral combat free zones), they are most commonly known by the subsect of their order that chooses to wander the wilderness of Terra A.D., rendering aid to any who seek it. Among most sentients, it is considered a blessed sign of the highest order to receive a visit from or encounter with a Holy Medicinal Order monk.</p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b>  Membership is normally limited to NPC characters. A PC of any genotype may join, but must forswear to forever give up all martial arts and combat, under pain of excommunication from the order.  </p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Members are universally treated as non-combatants by virtually all sentients living in Terra A.D. Bringing any harm to a monk of The Holy Medicinal order is considered a great taboo and an unforgivable sin.</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> Both hands clasped together palm inwards with fingers interlocked.</p>
                <h2><a id="The_Followers_Of_The_Voice_24"></a>The Curators / The Followers Of The Voice</h2>
                <p>The Followers of the Voice are a branch of the Curators and they consist of beings of all types who worship computers, believing that machines created the world and can again restore peace and order. They are always encountered near installations that have computers whose logic circuits agree, at least in part, with their philosophies. In some instances, the large computers, such as the think tank, have taken over their followers, and rule with dictatorial powers. Roving bands of the Followers of the Voice are occasionally encountered as they roam vast areas in search of computers and similar machinery to use as “shrines” for their strange religious rituals.</p>
                <p>The Curators are dominated by pure strain humans, but open to mutants and manimals, The Curators revere and worship all forms of ancient technology. This group is divided into three main sub-groups: the more orthodox Curators known as Conservators, and the far more open and liberal-thinking Traders. 
                <p>Among Curators, the Conservators believe that anything from a simple trinket to the most complex of mythical machines of the Ancients is in fact a holy object that should be collected, collated, and ultimately displayed inert and unused in a holy place of worship. They see their role as maintaining the artifacts and keeping them from being destroyed.  Conservators tend to only be involved in the maintenance and worship of these artifacts.</p>
                <p>The Archivists members usually possess strong attack and defense mutations and will not appear in groups of less than 10. They seek to buy items that they consider valuable, and are not above stealing if the price is too high. They especially like robots, which they deactivate and mount as statues of gods to protect their underground temples.  The Archivists work in concert with the Conservators.
                <p>The more liberal and practical Traders sect act as a barter-based merchant class in most tribes and villages, commonly trading in trinkets (small, otherwise worthless pieces of duralloy, plasteel, and permaglass), and much more rarely dealing in functional artifacts of the ancients.</p>
                <p><b>Qualifications:</b> Membership is open to any like-believing pure strain human, mutant, or manimal.</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> After acceptance into the order and a brief apprenticeship, members gain +1 to their Artifact checks (in addition to any other bonuses derived from genotype abilities or class abilities).</p>
                <p><b>Secret Sign:</b> The Conservators bring both hands brought together in a peak with thumbs touching at a downward angle, followed by a slight head nod.  The Archivists will use the same hand gesture but instead of a slight head nod they will display a slight shake their head.  Traders will use either opening gesture from above and follow it with a welcoming sweep of one hand (Traders).</p>


                <h1><a id="Not_Open_to_Players_32"></a>New Alignments Not Open to Players</h1>
                <h2><a id="The_Created_38"></a>The Created</h2>
                <p>This is a special cult, open only to androids. Its members believe that only machine-created “life”, such as computers, cyborgs, robots, and androids are worthy of continued survival. Of course they believe that androids should be the ruling class, even in the world of machines. Androids often pass as humans in human and humanoid societies, subverting their efforts and stealing technological devices for the “Created.”</p>
                <h2><a id="Knights_Of_Genetic_Purity_43"></a>Knights Of Genetic Purity / The Gene Police</h2>
                <p>“Purists” are Pure Strain Humans who wish to destroy all mutated humans. Unaccountably (or fortunately), they do not realize that animal and vegetable mutants are not “pure” either. “Purists” usually fight with sword and lance, on any available mount. A large number of them also have ancient energy weapons. They are very open about their hatred and wear a bright red square, printed, painted, or emblazoned in some way on the fronts of their garments or armor. Large groups of “Purists” have been known to hire out as mercenaries as long as the job involves the slaughter of humanoid mutants.</p>
				<p><b>The Gene Police</b> are a radicalized branch of the Knights of Genetic Purity.  Open only to pure strain humans (or those mutants who can pass for pure strain human), the Gene Police are bent upon eliminating all mutations. Highly clandestine by nature, their members are often found working undercover among more enlightened peoples and tribes, always seeking to tip the balance of power in favor of pure strain humans. No tactics are too underhanded, no lie too foul, no plan too brutal, if a member of the Gene Police thinks that such actions will result in the suffering or death of a mutant, manimal, or plantient. With sufficient time and resources, the Gene Police are capable of slowly taking over a tribal village, turning it into a Gene Police enclave populated only by pure strain humans.</p>
                <h2><a id="Friends_Of_Entropy_47"></a>Friends Of Entropy</h2>
                <p>Calling themselves the “Red Death,” their goal is to bring about the extinction of all life and the cessation of all mechanical operations. They are especially interested in destroying all equipment of robotic nature. Theirs is a nomadic society (since nobody wants them around), and they travel in small groups, spying out populated areas to raid or attack. Whenever possible, they steal babies of both humans and mutants and bring them up as the next generation of the “Red Death”.</p>
                <h2><a id="The_Iron_Society_51"></a>The Iron Society / Blessed Brotherhood</h2>
                <p>This is a group of human mutants bent on the destruction of all non-mutated Pure Strain Humans. Its groups are scattered about the world, especially near radiated areas. The Iron Society is very powerful in battle because its members use both mutated powers and ancient weapons of all sorts. They obviously will not mingle with humans, but can be found in societies of other mutants.</p>
                <p>Within the Iron Society is a group known internally as the Blessed Brotherhood.  Those outside the Iron Society call them the Vile Brotherhood.  This elite priesthood of mutants with superior mental mutations. A thoroughly evil and decadent cult, the Brotherhood is bent on nothing less than world domination, and to that end they are often among those found exploring and looting ancient ruins, seeking any means of achieving greater military power.</p>
                <h2><a id="Zoopremisists_55"></a>Zoopremisists</h2>
                <p>This group consists of non-humanoid, thinking mutant animals, who believe that the time has come for the “beasts” to rule the world. They have a secret police of highly trained, dangerous mutants that terrorize any who oppose them. Fortunately, Zoopremisists attract only a lunatic fringe of the thinking mutant animals, and their power is not yet very great. They can be found secreted in any large mass of mutants. Their agents are all telepathic and signal each other in that manner.</p>
                <h2><a id="The_Ranks_Of_The_Fit_59"></a>The Ranks Of The Fit</h2>
                <p>The Ranks of the Fit began soon after the destruction of the world.  A circus bear became self aware and discovered he had many new strange mental abilities.  He was the only intelligent creature to survive in the city.  He found himself with very little lacking and set about reading through the books the owner of the circus kept.  He consumed Mein Kampf, Animal Farm, This is a military-religious order, bent on controlling the world. Any means to this end is acceptable. It was founded by an enormous mutated bear, who wrote the organization’s guidelines after reading certain history books, Mein Kampf, Animal Farm, Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morality by Nietzsche, and several biographies of Napoleon Bonaparte.  With this knowledge he concluded that mutated intelligent animals are the rightful rulers of society and that all other life forms serve animals.  All forms of life may join, but only mutated intelligent animals may hold positions of power.  This bear, now calling himself Napoleon Bonaparte, seeks to establish a form of “Code Napoleon” throughout the world, “The Ranks of the Fit” have brought large groups of people, including several very advanced ancient cities under their well organized military fist. Although their armies are equipped mostly with crossbows and spears, no independent corps is allowed to operate without some very heavy weapons of the past, and the members will fight to obtain more. Their banner is the Tricolor with a gammadion superimposed.</p>
