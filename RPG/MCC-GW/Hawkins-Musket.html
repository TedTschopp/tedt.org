                <h1>.50 caliber Hawkins Musket</h1>
                <h2>Technology Level II</h2>
                <p class="description"><b>Description:</b> This percussion cap, black powder musket was popular in the mid-1800s and is now almost gone from Ganma World entirely. A few models do exist, however, and are very powerful.</p>
                <p class="background"> <b>Background:</b> The musket is old and must be loaded through the barrel with black powder and a ball. The loading time for someone familiar with this weapon is two turns at least.</p>
                <p class="Rules"> <b>Rules:</b>
                    <br>
                    <i>Name:</i> Rifle, black powder
                    <br>
                    <i>Damage Dice:</i> D10
                    <br>
                    <i>Rate of Fire:</i> Every three turns until they have been trained with the weapon and then every 2 turns.
                    <br>
                    <i>Speed:</i> -3
                    <br>
                    <i>Range:</i> 80/160/240
                    <br>
                    <i>Ammo:</i> 1
                    <br>
                    <i>Weight:</i> 15lbs
                    <br>
                    <i>Cost:</i> 250</p>
                <p class="Rules"><b>Firearm Rules:</b>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>Firearm Terms</i>
                        <br><i>Firearm Proficiency:</i> First-time users get a -1 die bump to attacks with a firearm and they increase the fumble die by +1. These penalties exists until either the character gains a level or appropriate training is acquired since first using the weapon.
                        <br><i>Rate of Fire:</i> Additional shots may be taken, up to the RoF, but each subsequent shot is -1 die bump lower. For example, a 3rd-level Warrior with a d20 Action Die and an Assault Rifle may attempt a 2nd shot with a d16 and a third shot with a d14. PCs with multiple Action Dice may attempt one (and only one) additional attack per extra action dice.A firearm with multiple RoFs may only fire once during the surprise round, but the chance of a critical hit should increase as per the Surprise Attack rule above. Automatic weapons are indicated by an (A).
                        <br><i>Reload:</i> Reloading a firearm manually can take up to a minute. If quick loaders or magazines are available, reloading takes one round. Black powder weapons can take up to 3 rounds to reload.
                        <br><i>Weapon Speed:</i> Weapon Speed is only a factor for individual initiative rolls during duels (see above) and does not apply to normal combat initiative.</p>
                    <p><i>Firearms Are Fast</i>
                        <br> Using a firearm gives a +1 Die bump for initiative. This represents how quickly a gun can be fired.</p>
                    <p><i>Hits Do 1 Die of Damage</i>
                        <br> Each firearm has its own damage die; typically d8 for handguns and d10 or more for longarms. For a standard attack, a hit does 1 die of damage. Damage is treated just like any other missile or melee attack, and can be healed as normal.</p>
                    <p><i>Aiming Increases the Attack and Damage Die By One</i>
                        <br> As an action, the shooter may take time to aim. This will increase the attack roll by 1 Die on the dice chain and hits will increase the damage by an additional die (as opposed to a die bump)! </p>
                    <p><i>Taking Cover, When Available, is a Move and Gives a Bonus to AC</i>
                        <br> Taking cover is key to surviving a gun fight. If a target is actively hiding behind hard cover, no attacks can be made. If the target is firing back from behind some hard cover, the cover provides a+4 to AC. Firing from a firing port, murder hole or arrow slit can provide up to+8 points of AC.</p>
                    <p><i>Automatic Weapons do 3 Dice of Damage</i>
                        <br> Weapons with a RoF that indicates an (A), instead of separate attacks, automatic weapons can affect multiple targets in a 10-foot square area. An automatic fire attack uses 10 rounds of ammunition. The attacker makes a single attack roll thatâ€™s compared to the AC of each target in the area. A hit causes 3 dice worth of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half. A critical hit (natural 20) does 6 dice of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half.</p>
