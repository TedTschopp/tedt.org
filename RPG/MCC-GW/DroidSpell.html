<p><i>1:</i> Lost and failure
                    <br>
<i>2 - 11:</i> Failure, the program projects a canned holo-loop of R2D2 / C3PO asking the viewers to be sure to watch the re-release of A New Hope in HALE-E-Vision coming next month to their Disney approved HALE-E family interactive center.  The program is not lost.
                    <br>

                    <br>
<i>14 - 17:</i> The shaman is able project a more complex hologram of R2D2 / C3PO that moves, but is purely visual.
                    <br>
<i>18 - 19:</i> The shaman is able project a complex hologram of R2D2 / C3PO that moves, with both visual and auditory elements.
                    <br>
<i>20 - 23:</i> The shaman is able project a complex hologram of R2D2 / C3PO and one other Star Wars Characters that moves, with both visual, auditory, and olfactory elements.
                    <br>
<i>24 - 27:</i> The shaman is able project an interactive hologram R2D2 / C3PO and two other Star Wars Characters that moves, with both visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile elements; the hologram is a hard hologram and may cause up to 1d6 in damage.
                    <br>

                    <br>
<i>32+:</i> The shaman is seemingly capable of reordering reality itself, creating a complex and interactive experience featuring places from within the Star Wars Universe with unerring verisimilitude for all living creatures within range; events transpire in the illusory reality at the shaman’s direction, and have the same impact and results has though they actually happened.  The physical environment may not be damaged in this way.</p>
