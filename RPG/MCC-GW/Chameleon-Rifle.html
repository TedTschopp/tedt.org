                <h2>Technology Level III</h2>
                <p class="description"><b>Description:</b> The Chameleon Rifle is made primarily of high impact, transparent plastic, and light metal alloys. Not only is it lightweight, but the mechanism and ammunition can be seen inside. The magazine holds 40 plastic slugs. It can also fire 22 millimeter tail grenades.  It weighs around 2.5 kilograms and is 80 centimeters long.  The slug-thrower rifle-type weapon was designed on the popular "bull pup" style; that is, the clip and feed mechanism are located in the stock behind the firing mechanism, there is a grip in front of the firing handle for easier control, and the barrel, while maintaining its length, is set farther back in the weapon, making it appear short and squat. It has a handle/telescope on top that allows the user to fire at full range.</p>
                <p class="background"> <b>Background:</b> The Chameleon Rifle was the last rifle manufactured in the U.S. in any quantity before the holocaust.
