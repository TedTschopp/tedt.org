                <h1>Chameleon Rifle</h1>
                <h2>Technology Level III</h2>
                <p class="description"><b>Description:</b> The Chameleon Rifle is made primarily of high impact, transparent plastic, and light metal alloys. Not only is it lightweight, but the mechanism and ammunition can be seen inside. The magazine holds 40 plastic slugs. It can also fire 22 millimeter tail grenades. The slug-thrower rifle-type weapon was designed on the popular "bull pup" style; that is, the clip and feed mechanism are located in the stock behind the firing mechanism, there is a grip in front of the firing handle for easier control, and the barrel, while maintaining its length, is set farther back in the weapon, making it appear short and squat. It has a handle/telescope on top that allows the user to fire at full range.</p>
                <p class="background"> <b>Background:</b> The Chameleon Rifle was the last rifle manufactured in the U.S. in any quantity before the holocaust. It is called a Chameleon Rifle because it has interchangeable barrels that allow it to fire as a rifle, a semi-automatic rifle, or as a fully automatic rifle.</p>
                <p class="Rules"> <b>Rules:</b></p>
                <h3 id="rate-of-fire">Rate of Fire</h3>
                <p>This is the number of shots an attacker may take for his action, up to the Rate of Fire. However, each subsequent shot after the first shot decreases the die they use to roll their attacks by -1d. A firearm with multiple RoFs may fire once and only during the surprise round. Automatic weapons are indicated by a number that indicates the number of rounds used followed by an &#39;A&#39;. A rate of fire that is expressed as a fraction like x/y means that the attacker may make x number of attacks before reloading for y uninterrupted rounds. </p>
                <h3 id="automatic-weapons">Automatic Weapons</h3>
                <p>Weapons with a RoF that indicates an (A), instead of separate attacks, automatic weapons can affect multiple targets in a 10-foot square area. An automatic fire attack uses 10 rounds of ammunition. The attacker makes a single attack roll that’s compared to the AC of each target in the area. A hit causes 3 dice worth of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half. A critical hit on the to hit roll by the attacker (natural 20) does 6 dice of damage, DC 10 Ref save by the defender will save for for half of the damage rolled.</p>
