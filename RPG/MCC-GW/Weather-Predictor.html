        <h1>Weather Predictor</h1>
        <h2>(Tech 'Level V)</h2>
        <p>This alien artifact was discovered over a decade ago and still works accurately today. The Brotherhood of Thought will lend it to the party and show them how it works. If normal rain is expected in the next 24 hours, the indicator turns gray; if sunny skies, the indicator turns blue. If abnormal weather is coming within the next 24 hours, the indicator turns red. The brighter the red, the more intense (and possibly more dangerous) the weather.</p>
        <p> is a device used by aliens visiting the planet years after the holocaust that created Gamma World. It is still in alignment with the orbiting alien weather satellite that feeds the device information about perceived approaching wea_ther patterns. The device is 15 centimeters long, shaped like a disk with an indicator window and an activation but­ton. On the back is a miniplug where the min­iature speaker would normally connect to provide the alien user with complete details about the approaching weather patterns in his own language. The speaker is now gone, but the indicator window still works. </p>
