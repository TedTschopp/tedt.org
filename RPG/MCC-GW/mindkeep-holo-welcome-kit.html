                <h1>Welcome to Mindkeep. </h1>
                <p>The Mindkeep installation is designed to survive a nuclear war while protecting you and your studies and coworkers. As members of the facility you will be helping with the experimentation, development, and deployment of genetic modification techniques to assist in the survival of the planet. The government has gathered you along with the most brilliant genetic scientists into one location to create a focused and distraction free environment were mankind can focus on this important work. All our occupants have been psychologically screened to ensure the highest levels of dedication to the completion of our task. You will be given access to the most modern research installation ever developed. Your goal is to find the Alpha Factor, which is said to be the key to creating genetic mutations. Once we can figure out the control mechanisms on the Alpha Factor we will have the ability to produce an entire race of new humans which will turn the tide of the battle with the alien invaders. </p>
                <p>The Mindkeep tower itself is over 180 feet tall and 150 feet in diameter with walls that are 6 feet thick reinforced concrete and duralloy using federally rated designs that have been tested to withstand a direct nuclear blast. The tower features no windows and has only one door. All of the electrical wiring, fixtures, plumbing, and air shafts are built into the wall and the concrete / duralloy mixture was poured around these features. </p>
                <p>The design of the installation is that of a hollow cylinder with rooms around the entire circum­ference, a circular balcony outside the rooms, connected to a central core elevator by ramps. This design not only allows for increased secu­rity (as it is easier to seal off levels in the event of a breach), but allows for a large open space inside the structure to prevent a feeling of being enclosed . The open air is also used as a huge vent for air con­ditioning, heating, and atmospheric controls. The thick walls and lack of windows provided excellent insulation and to this day, the inside temperature is a constant 72 degrees. </p>
                <p>All of the service functions were powered by nuclear generators. Elevator compart­ments, ramps, and the balcony are always lighted. Room lights come on when the door is opened by any means. lf a room does not light up with indirect lighting. </p>
                <p>All of the doors in Mindkeep are sliding metal doors and open to properly coded ID bracelets. If, for some reason, the generator in the lower levels is turned off or otherwise ren­dered useless, all of the lights turn off and the doors automatically shut and lock in order to ensure the safety of our human occupants while service and security are dispatched to restore power. </p>
                <p>There is an internal balcony on each floor that runs around the center which the rooms open onto is always 2.5 meters wide. It has a one meter high railing that is made of high strength steel. Ramps lead to the elevator core. The ramps also are made of high strength steel and have one meter high steel railings. The height between ramps and balconies is around four meters. Each level has a restroom. Each restroom has a toilet, sink, full length mirror, shower, and couch in it. Be sure to let the Mindkeep Calendar know your preferred time to use the shower facilities. There are enough showers and baths for all residents, however these facilities are not concentrated near the living quarters.</p>

                <h2>Sub Level 3 and below</h2>
                <p>Sub Level 3 and below are the levels that house the most advanced quantum engagement generators deployed in North America. These systems have been deployed in triplicate in order to ensure that in the event of a targeted attack these.</p>
                <h2>Sub Level 2</h2>
                <p>This is the freight level as well as the level of the facility that contains the control station for our quantum entanglement generators.</p>
                <p>The floor is also home to our auditorium for holding general all hands staff meetings</p>
                <h2>Sub Level 1</h2>
                <p>Level of the facility is our Think Tank that runs and automate our facility. We also house our internal broadcast power systems here that power our security systems and bots. Our facility is home to 5 Death Machines, 10 warbots, and over 144 security robots.</p>
