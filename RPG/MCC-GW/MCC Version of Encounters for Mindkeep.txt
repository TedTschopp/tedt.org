				2 x Vene'aMub 'Villain that Hides and Kills' (1d4+1 (3)): Init +2; atk 2 x "hands" melee +8 (1d4+6) and tail melee +8 (1d3+6); AC 15; HD 7D7 hp 28 each; MV 20' ; 1d20; SV Fort +0, Ref -2, Will -2	The Vene'a'mub is similar to a six legged scorpion with large, four gitit hands instead of pincers.  A bludgeon tail instead of a stinger, and a lizard like head that weaves back and forth on a thick muscular neck.  They are usally colocred an oily blue when they are not camouglaged.  They have the intelligence and ability to cover themselves with their surroundings for their own safety or to trap prey.	The Vene'a'mub only attacks when hungry or if walked on, a common occurrence considering its camouflage abilities.  It is also able to alter its exoskeleton to be wide or thinner, thereby flattening itself.  Their favorite food is bone marrow, which it feeds on after splintering the bone of its prey with its bare hands.  Because of this, they prefer mammals, and love slightly mutated ones.  They will always attack the mutants first.  They are very curious and can be found in most climates.	(P) Collapsible Exoskeleton

		4 x Ba'Sled 'Rock that Burrows' (1d4+1 (3)): Init +3; atk 2 x claws melee +8 (1d3+6); AC 15; HD 7D7 hp 28 each; MV 30' or Burrow 30' ; 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref -1, Will -1	Based appear as gray, hunched-over bipedal humanoids with long, apeish arms ending in large claws.  If they stand still they can pass for rocks using the same rules Plantients can to hide.  They have a goat-shaped head with two wide set eyes.  They are extremely billigerent towards intelligent life forms.	The Ba'sled is extremely billigerent towards intelligent life forms.  They can seldom be bargined with with or telepathically communicated wiht because of their attitude.  They can dig through anything but metal at their normal movmeent rate, clawing right through stone walls as if they were so much clay.  They often make traps by digging underground tunnel mazes, then making pits from the tunnel up to just below ground level.  These pits will not support the full weight of more than one human-sized creature and can drop members of a party of adventurers into the waiting claws of the Ba'sleds.  In additino to their murderous claws they also have a sonic roar that can only be used once a day.  This attack does 1d5 damage to everything 15 feet in front of the roaring Based.  They are immune to their own sonic roars.	(P) Ultravision, Infravision, Sonic Roar

				1 x Sre'froth 'Invisible Glider' (1d4 (2)): Init -1; atk wing melee -1 (1d3-2); AC 12; HD 3D7 hp 12 each; MV 4' or Fly 26' ; 1d20; SV Fort +0, Ref -2, Will -1	Sre’froth are lifeofrms that resemble two to three meter transparent gelatinous planes. Their origins are unknown, but they are thought to be amphibians who learned how to glide. They are definitely not flyers. Sre’froth can blend in anywhere, crawl up any surface, and attach themselves on anything, even ceilings, by secreting a warm, sticky fluid as they move. 	Thousands of transparent cilia on their bodies can “feel” body heat within a 50 foot radius, high heat can be felt at even greater distances. Sre’froth feed on animals they detect and come into contact with by wrapping around them, somewhat like plastic food wrap, and secreting strong acid around the prey. This usually dissolves their victims in a very short time and the ooze that is left over is absorbed into the sre’froth as straight protein. Their damage is considered to be Intensity 2d6+4 poison/ corrosive. Damage from this special type of attack is per turn of envelopment. The outer protein (clothing, hide, armor, etc.) must be eaten away before the character takes damage, unless a large portion of their body is exposed. Use the following chart to determine the time required by the sre’froth to consume different types of materials. Remember, any equipment the sre’froth comes into contact with will also be affected.  Cloth, Vegetation, Wood, Common Plastics, and Most synthetics survive for 1 turn.  Light metals and Heavy Plastics survive for two turns.  Heavy Metals and Plastic / metal alloys will survive for three turns.  Ceramics, Glass, Curalloy and certain other materials are not affected.  Sre’froth can only be hurt by poison, sonics, super-strong acids (Intensity 17+), fire, or drowning. Once they have climbed to a height of at least 10 feet they can launch themselves into a silent glide. The distance of the glide cannot exceed the height of their climb.   On the ground sre’froth are 95% undetectable by sight, when gliding this drops to 75%. They cannot sense body heat through ba’mutan hides and those characters protected by such can pass by sre’froth undetected. Ruins, caves, deep woods, buildings, and canyons are their favorite environs but they can be found anywhere.

It is a constrictor and attacks by enveloping its prey and constricting around them.  Once it has wrapped itself once around the prey it will start to bite it as well.  The Choslith hunt by smell and are just a deadly at dark as in the light of day.  They are found in all climates except artic.	The Choslith will roll to hit with the coils and if it is sucessful it will have ensnared its victim.  The following turn the Choslith will attempt one additional coil per turn up to the maximum.  Each coil will do its damage individually.  To remove a coil the victim must roll a Strength Context.  The Chotslith has a +4 modifier to that roll.	(M) Mental Shield

They make strange, almost electronic sounds.  They live in holdes in the round or in among rocks and cliffs. They always travel in flocks and act as a single unit	The Shez'ur Attack together.  When attacking the birds everyone suffers a -2d to hit due to their size.   The birds themselves will attack one target at a time.  They will cause 1d10 for every 10 birds in the flock.  Their spikes effectively reduce all AC by 3.  An attacked character can not see through the swarm.  Movement is reduced to one quarter if more than 30 birds attack.  They are generally peaceful, unless their nests are threatened or loud noises frighten them.	(M) Racial Mind

Wild and domestic sheezu come in various hues. Their multiple legs and razor-sharp claws allow them amazing climbing abilities (as per Land Speed), even on almost sheer surfaces. Furthermore, they are some of fastest diggers.	The Sheezu can completely bury themselves in 3 turns.     If a sheezu feels threatened and bites, it immediately salivates its acidic digestive juices into the wound, causing an additional 1d4 points of damage. This always happens on the first bite, but thereafter occurs on alternating turns. The sheezu can keep biting every turn, but can secrete acid only every other turn. They can use four of their eight claws during any turn unless a character or creature makes the mistake of picking them up or turning them on their back, whereupon they can use all eight claws and their bite. Sheezu make wonderful pets and will never use their claws or bite and acid unless they feel extremely threatened. A qualified animal trainer can teach a sheezu a maximum of three commands or “tricks”. 	(P) Absorption - Acid

They have long bristles across their bodies, making them unpalatable prey to all but the largest creatures.  They have 12 eyes located all over their head, giving them 360 degree sight.  Two types of attercops exist, one dwells strickly in its huge web, while the second (Attercop Abulare) is an active hunter, preferring ot use its web only to shackle its prey	The attercop attacks with a bite, causing 1d4 damage.  As the teeth hit their mark, the creature uses its electrical generation to jolt the prey.  Once its victim stops moving the attercop trusses it in stick webbing, Creatures held in this manner must make a DC 10 Sterngth Check to escape.  Attercops keep their prey as long as four days before they settle down to feed.  Becasuse of the creatures extraordinarily high Mental strength, the attercop is completely immune to all mental attacks except illusions.  These metnal attacks always suceed.  The attercop is a solitary hunter, allowing no othes of its kind witin its web or territory except during fall breeding, Female attercops deposit a half-meter diameter egg sac containing over 1000 young.  Blights, bloodbirds and carrins hunt these young attercops, likking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselvers.  The attercop's dlae resistant web sometimesa streches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in thie web need to makle a DC 5 strength check to escpae.  Any loot found in an attercop's web si emerely undigestible waste to the spider.  The lil, commonly take refuge within or behind attercop webs, although some fall prey to the spider.

They resemble 1.5m tall crystalline cones that have millions of 10cm bristles underneath that provide locomotion. So smooth is the bristling action that it looks like the omnitar is floating on air and just brushing the ground. Omnitar have no attack forms in and of themselves. They are immune to nearly every attack form but fusion rifles or trek bombs. Any weapon causing physical damage merely bounces off them. If hit by any other type of energy weapon, they add one point to their Hit Point score for every two points of “damage” striking them. If struck with lasers or sonics, they will automatically return that round, treat as -1 to hit. If more that 750 points of damage are pumped into them, they will shatter causing fragmentation damage (5d10) to everything within a 10m radius. Omnitars are usually found on plains, gentle rolling hills, and forests.

There are the remains of 2d3 creatures in this "cell," they appear to all be dead.  However these creatures are all aliens who have gone into hibernation.  If the door is opened and the "remains" are left alone they will come out of hibernation and they will eat each other and the players will have Shreelon on their hands.  This Shreelon will taunt, hurt, and terrorize the players.  It will not kill the players.  It will not kill anyone, it will just escape into the lands of Gamma World.

Many of their minions were encountered in that adventure, but the Shreelon themselves never made an appearance. They are from beyond our galaxy. They are humanoid in appearance except for a slightly bloated head having a number of tentacles where their mouth should be – looking a bit like some Lovecraftian horror. They have two large milky white eyes with no pupils giving the impression of soulless evil. Their skin is the darkest black, almost seeming to absorb light. It is clammy/slimy to the touch. They consider mankind cattle and slaves. They eat the brains (and occasionally flesh) of those they consider lower life forms. Though incredibly intelligent, they are a thoroughly vile and evil race. They seem to dislike bright light. Their technology is based on crystal (and occasionally organic) devices (Tech V). They use a hieroglyphic written language and no spoken language. They communicate entirely by telepathy. To a player character, Shreelon ‘speech’ sounds like a loud echoing whisper inside their head. The Shreelon work by ‘proxy’ whenever they can, finding it advantageous to work through others or use acquired resources to accomplish most tasks rather than direct investment. However, when they are encountered in the flesh, they are terrifying adversaries. Following this principle, there is some evidence to suggest that the Shreelon had a hand in the founding of the Friends of Entropy cryptic alliance.  This enables them to further divide and weaken Earth’s sentient races without direct risk to themselves. Even before their attack on Earth, it appears that the aliens were working behind the scenes, influencing events which would set the stage for the apocalypse (inciting nation against nation). Their Mental Control ability is slightly different than listed in the rulebook. They are able to dominate a subject without actually leaving their own body – if the victim dies, regardless of range, the controller is uninjured. If control is broken the victim will not remember being controlled."	They consider mankind cattle and slaves. They eat the brains (and occasionally flesh) of those they consider lower life forms.

		Room D - The White Room
			Description:
				This small operating room appears to be completely normal and amazingly clean.  Not until someone touches the white walls will the players realize that they are covered in pure white fungus.  If all the fungus is taken out of the room, chopped up, and boiled down and inhaled as a vapor, it restores hit pints to anyone inhaling it (Fortitude roll to succeedin 4d3 hitpoints to a max of 50 per week).  Anyone with a gatherer's background will know this on a successful intelligence check.  
		Room E - The Pharmacy
			Description:
				The door to this room is open and lights are burned out.  There are two suclith perched above the door.   The room is full of hundreds in injectules.  All empty.

				2 x Sucslith 'Sucker Snake' (1d4+1 (3)): Init +2; atk bite melee +7 (1d3+6); AC 13; HD 3D7 hp 12 each; MV 31' ; 1d20; SV Fort -1, Ref +0, Will -1	The entire body of a sucslith, usually over 6 feet long, is covered with sucker –like discs and barbed tendrils. The snake’s ability to crawl anywhere is amazing (equal to its land speed on any surface but liquid, which reduces its speed by half). It prefers to climb up to a vantage point, usually about 3m above the surface and stay there indefinitely until prey comes along. It is a chameleon and can match its surrounding coloration in 5 turns.	The sucslith is able to fast for weeks, and can recycle its body fluids, negating the necessity of moving to find moisture. When attacking, the sucslith normally uses its web first. This web can work in one of two ways. Either it can be used to “catch” a small target (range 6m) or it can clog up a 3m area. This second type of web is sufficiently thick enough to slow the movement of anyone in the affected area to half speed, except for the sucslith itself, which has no difficulty moving through its own or another suslith’s web. The web has a strength of 20.  Oftentimes this intelligent snake will lay down its thick web underneath rotting floorboards or during a leaf fall, knowing it will be camouflaged. It will then perch at a vantage point above the webbed area and wait for a good sized victim to come along. Once the creature is slowed down by the ground web, the sucslith will cover it with another web, thus preventing its prey from seeing or using its appendages for combat. Then, the sucslith drops down on the hapless victim and enters the web, biting until the creature is dead. Unfortunately, sucsliths can be found anywhere, though they tend to avoid deserts and deathlands. 
		Room F - Medbot
			Description: 
				A completely operational med-bot is here.  It asks if it can help and does its utmost to heal characters, if the characters answer its questions.  Upon entering the room, the med-bot activates and asks "Service Code Please?".  Giving the name and number of any of the badges found in a variety of places around the facility allows the med-bot to help the character.  He also records the image of any party member with the name and number provided.  Thereafter the party member takes on the identity of that person in the Mindkeep facility.  The robot will continue to interact with the players in a pleasing manner, but will not answer any questions until they are properly tagged into the system.

				1 x Medical Robot 'Medbot' (1d2 (1)): Init +3; atk 2 x tentcles melee +8 (1d7+6); AC 17; HD 3D12 hp 20; MV 30' or Treads 200' ; 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will -1	This upright-walking, 2 meter tall unit is humanoid in shape. It has two arms and two 1 meter tentacles, each of which is equipped for handling precision instruments. Special equipment includes all normal Medi-kit tools and materials (in 5 times the quantity found in a Medi-kit) plus more extensive medical labs than are in the Medi-kit. A Medical Robot can perform complex surgery, if necessary. It heals characters at the same rate as a Medi-kit (1d10+20 hit points of damage to Pure Strain Humans and 1d10+10 hit points of damage to Humanoids and Mutated Animals).

				The door is open to this room.  This is the chemical storage area.  There are all kinds of glass and plastic containers filled with all kinds of chemicals.  The felt tip marker writing has worn off on all of these and what they are is anyone's guess.  There is a 100 liter drump of alcohol that was meant to be used for antiseptic purposes, but can be used as fuel for the car in the maintenance building if the players gan get it down to ground level.  If the players take the time to sift through all the containers, two things happen.  First, they suffer 1d6 damage from mild chemicals.  Second, they find a strange ring that will open the armory.

			5 x Accelera Dose: A 10 centimeter long disposable jet-spray tube of a compound developed to accelerate healing. Characters who spray the compound under their skin immediately heal 1d10 Hit Points of damage. There is a 40% chance that this compound will work on Humanoids and a 20% chance it will work on Mutated Animals. If it fails to work, the user is considered to have been exposed to 3d6 Intensity Level poison as a result of using the substance.
			1 x Antiradiation Serum	Ancient Pharmaceuticals & Drugs	This drug is contained in a 10-centimeter long disposable jet spray tube.  It prevents radiation damage.  If sprayed under the skin with 3 turns of exposure, the character suffers no damage or mutation from the radiation.

Use of this substance as the sole source of nourishment for more than a month results in the atrophying of normal digestive organs making it impossible for the user to derive sustenance from anything except this substance. There is a 95% chance that it will work for a Humanoid and an 80% chance that it will work for a Mutated Animal. If it doesn't work, the user is exposed to 3d4 Intensity Level poison.
