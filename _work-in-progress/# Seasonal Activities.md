### Face Death

You are had heard of the harrowing experience of your physical body failing you completely, but living through it is a nightmare beyond comprehension. Stricken by a debilitating condition, you are trapped within the confines of your immobile body, unable to communicate or express your consciousness. Everyone around you believes you are lifeless, and the weight of their grief and acceptance of your demise adds to your feelings of isolation and powerlessness. The anguish of being aware but unable to move or respond overwhelms you, and you yearn for the simplest freedoms that were once taken for granted. You are plagued by fears of being forgotten and misunderstood, as those closest to you grapple with the void left by your supposed passing. In the midst of this heart-wrenching ordeal, you summon unimaginable strength from within. Though your body has betrayed you, your spirit refuses to be silenced. 

You discover alternative means of communication and strive to make your presence known.

Each small triumph becomes a monumental victory, and the love and support that surrounds you ignite a flicker of hope. You redefine your perception of life and resilience as you navigate the darkest corners of existence. Though your physical body may be incapacitated, your indomitable spirit burns bright, leaving an indelible mark on all who bear witness to your profound determination and will to survive.

As you embark on the journey to complete healing, the first step lies in reclaiming mastery over your physical body. Through relentless determination and the unwavering support of medical professionals, you undergo rigorous physical therapy and rehabilitation. Each day presents new challenges, but you confront them with unwavering courage. Slowly, the strength returns to your limbs, and you gain greater control over your movements. The once-distant dream of mobility becomes a reality as you take your first steps unaided. You learn to cherish the simple act of standing, walking, and embracing the world around you. This arduous process not only rebuilds your physical abilities but also cultivates an unyielding resilience that serves as the foundation for your remarkable recovery.

### Pass Down Knowledge or Skill

"Learning is an ornament in prosperity, a refuge in adversity, and a provision in old age." â€“ Aristotle

As your character's journey progresses, they accumulate a wealth of knowledge and skills, some of which become defining aspects of their identity. However, there comes a time when sharing this knowledge becomes as important as acquiring it. The "Pass Down Knowledge or Skill" activity allows your character to impart their expertise to a younger or less experienced individual, shaping their future and extending your character's influence.

When engaging in this activity, envision whom your character would choose as their protÃ©gÃ©. It might be a young adventurer thirsty for knowledge, a member of your community eager to learn a trade, or perhaps a relative looking to follow in your footsteps. This transfer of wisdom can take many forms: a series of intensive training sessions, the crafting of a detailed manuscript, or even a long-term mentorship.

#### Rules for Passing Down Knowledge or Skill

To successfully pass down your knowledge or skill, select the specific area of expertise you wish to impart. This can be a skill your character is proficient in, a piece of lore they have uncovered, or a unique technique they have mastered.

1. **Choose the ProtÃ©gÃ©**: Identify a suitable character within the game world who would benefit from your knowledge. This could be an NPC or another player's character, subject to their agreement and the game master's approval.

2. **Determine the Training Process**: Outline how you plan to teach your protÃ©gÃ©. This might involve a series of skill checks to represent the training process. The complexity and duration of training should reflect the depth and rarity of the knowledge being passed on.

3. **Training Outcome**:
   - **Success**: If the skill checks are successful, your protÃ©gÃ© gains a basic understanding or proficiency in the skill or knowledge area. This can manifest as a bonus in their future skill checks related to this area.
   - **Partial Success**: If the skill checks yield mixed results, the protÃ©gÃ© gains some insight but may need further training to fully grasp the skill or knowledge.
   - **Failure**: Should the skill checks fail, the training does not produce the desired outcome, but the attempt may still foster a bond between your character and the protÃ©gÃ©, leading to future roleplaying opportunities.

4. **Long-term Impact**: Reflect on how this transfer of knowledge impacts both your character and their protÃ©gÃ©. It's a chance for character growth, establishing new relationships, and potentially shaping future events in the game world.

Remember, this activity isn't just about the transfer of skills; it's about the legacy your character is building and the bonds they forge along the way.

### Establish a Legacy Project

"The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it." â€“ William James

This endeavor is not just about leaving a physical legacy; it's about creating something that embodies the spirit and story of your character, a testament to their life and efforts that will benefit future generations.

#### Rules for Establishing a Legacy Project

4. **Outcome and Impact**:
   - **Success**: On successful completion, the project becomes a recognized part of the game world. It might offer ongoing benefits or influence, like a safe haven for adventurers, a learning center offering knowledge, or a monument that inspires.

5. **Legacy and Continuation**: Reflect on how this project becomes part of your characterâ€™s legacy. How does it affect the communities and lands it touches? Will it require ongoing oversight or provide a platform for future adventures?

Engaging in this activity allows for deep character development and can significantly impact the game world, offering a tangible manifestation of your character's journey and ideals.

#### Rules for Crafting a Heirloom

1. **Design the Heirloom**: Begin by deciding what type of item you want to create. It should be something that resonates with your character's story and abilities.

   - **Infusing Essence**: Beyond the physical crafting, consider how your character's essence, experiences, or powers are imbued into the heirloom. This might require additional skill checks or narrative descriptions.

4. **Outcome and Significance**:
   - **Success**: A successful crafting process results in an heirloom that carries not just material value but also significant personal and magical properties. It might confer specific bonuses or abilities, or simply hold immense sentimental value.
   - **Partial Success**: The heirloom is created, but it may lack some of the intended power or significance. It still holds value and can be a focal point for future development.
   - **Failure**: The crafting process faces unexpected difficulties. The resultant item may still hold meaning as a symbol of the attempt and the character's intentions.

5. **Passing the Heirloom On**: Contemplate how this heirloom will be passed down or used in the future. Will it be given to a protÃ©gÃ©, used by future generations, or perhaps become a key element in an ongoing storyline?

Crafting an heirloom is a deeply personal and potentially game-changing activity. It allows your character to leave a lasting mark on the world, creating an item that can carry their legacy forward.

3. **Presentation of the Work**:

4. **Outcome and Influence**:
   - **Success**: A successful composition resonates with the audience, becoming a part of the cultural landscape. It might inspire others, become a symbol of a certain idea or movement, or simply be cherished as a work of art.
   - **Partial Success**: The work is completed but perhaps does not achieve the widespread acclaim or impact hoped for. It might still be significant to certain individuals or groups.
   - **Failure**: The creative process proves more challenging than expected. The result might not be the masterpiece envisioned, but the attempt itself can become a story worth telling.

5. **Legacy of the Composition**: Reflect on how this creation adds to your characterâ€™s legacy. Does it become a popular anthem in taverns, a rallying cry for a cause, or a deeply personal work that moves those who encounter it?

### Create a Map or Chronicle

"Geography is the subject which holds the key to our future." â€“ Michael Palin

In the "Create a Map or Chronicle" activity, your character takes on the role of a cartographer or historian, documenting the landscapes they've traversed or the events they've witnessed.

### Name an Heir - to fix

"In his will he hath bequeathed to you his mansion, his plate, his money and his lands." - William Shakespeare, "Much Ado About Nothing"

An heir isn't just someone who inherits your belongings; they are a person in whom you see a fragment of yourself, a successor to continue your battle against the forces of darkness. Initially, the heir is a non-player character, but they will become a playable character if and when you leave the story for any reason.

When you choose this undertaking, you must name an heir and note it on your character sheet. You immediately gain 1 point of Hope, representing your aspirations for your heir's future. Conversely, if your chosen heir meets an unfortunate end, you instantly receive 4 Shadow points.

This choice is a one-time event; you can't name another heir later.

### Name an Heir - Fixed

"Legacy is not leaving something for people. It's leaving something in people." â€“ Peter Strople

The "Name an Heir" activity allows your character to designate a successor, a symbolic and literal passing of the torch to a new generation. This heir, chosen for their potential to embody and continue your characterâ€™s legacy, becomes a significant figure in your narrative, embodying your character's hopes and values. The act of naming an heir is not just about bequeathing material possessions but is a profound statement of trust and expectation, a hope that your battles and beliefs will live on.

#### Rules for Naming an Heir

1. **Selection of the Heir**: When you decide to name an heir, consider who in the game world embodies aspects of your characterâ€™s spirit and values. This person becomes more than a mere recipient of material wealth; they are the continuation of your characterâ€™s story.

2. **Formalizing the Heir**:
   - **Recording the Choice**: Officially name your chosen heir on your character sheet. This act signifies a deep bond and a significant shift in your characterâ€™s narrative.
   - **Hope and Responsibility**: Upon naming the heir, your character gains 1 point of Hope, reflecting the optimism and aspirations placed in the heirâ€™s future.

3. **Impact of the Heirâ€™s Fate**:
   - If the chosen heir suffers an unfortunate fate, your character is deeply affected, receiving 4 Shadow points. This represents the emotional and psychological impact of losing someone you envisioned as a key part of your legacy.

4. **Irrevocability of the Decision**:
   - The choice to name an heir is a one-time event. Once made, it cannot be undone or altered. This irrevocability adds weight and significance to the decision, making it a pivotal moment in your characterâ€™s story.

5. **Legacy and Continuity**:
   - The heir, initially a non-player character, has the potential to become a playable character if your current character exits the story for any reason. This transition can create a seamless narrative link between characters and generations within the game.

Naming an heir in the game is a powerful and character-defining choice. It's an opportunity to explore themes of legacy, hope, and the continuation of ideals beyond a single character's lifetime, adding depth and continuity to the storytelling experience.

On a strong hit, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you Sojourn, take +1 more.

On a weak hit, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, Lose Momentum (-1). On a miss, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. Pay the Price.

### RESUPPLY

When you attempt to bolster your readiness, envision the opportunity and your approach. If youâ€¦

âœ´ Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
âœ´ Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
âœ´ Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
âœ´ Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits

On a strong hit, choose one.

âœ´ If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
âœ´ If you are in need of a specific item or resource that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a weak hit, as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a miss, you encounter an unexpected peril. Pay the Price.

### HEAL

When you receive medical care or provide treatment, envision the situation and roll. If youâ€¦

âœ´ Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
âœ´ Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
âœ´ Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
âœ´ Provide care: Roll +wits

On a strong hit, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a weak hit, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: Lose Momentum (-2) or Sacrifice Resources (-2).

On a miss, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. Pay the Price.

### REPAIR

When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other devices, envision the situation and roll. If youâ€¦

âœ´ Make your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs: Roll +wits
âœ´ Obtain repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply

On a hit, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the
table below. Additionally, you may Sacrifice Resources and exchange
each -1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

| Situation     | Strong Hit | Weak Hit |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| At a facility | 5 points   | 3 points |
| In the field  | 3 points   | 1 points |
| Under fire    | 2 points   | 0 points |

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.

âœ´ Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
âœ´ Fix one broken module: 2 points
âœ´ Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
âœ´ Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
âœ´ Repair any other device: 3 points
âœ´ Repair any other device, but with a complication or malfunction: 2 points

On a miss, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. Pay the Price.

### Raise Standard of Living

"Champagne arrived, in a bucket of crushed ice, as if it were the most commonplace thing in the world." - "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Having a stash of valuable resources gives you the freedom to live more comfortably. If you decide to spend some downtime at your base or home, you have the option to dip into your assets to enhance your quality of life. This could cover everything from daily expenses to acquiring new gear.

It costs 1 unit of assets to maintain a Prosperous lifestyle for one month, and 2 units for Rich one. At the end of the month, you'll need to spend the same amount again to keep living at that standard, or else you'll revert to your previous way of life.

Feel free to invest as much of your assets as you desire to sustain an elevated standard of living for an extended period.

### Raise Standing

"Status is your position on the playing field of life. Status is your true wealth." - from "American Psycho" by Bret Easton Ellis

Your hard-earned riches can be a powerful tool, not just for personal gain, but for increasing your influence and stature within your community, whether it's a far-future space station, a steampunk metropolis, or a post-apocalyptic tribe. Considerable in both material and immaterial realms, these assets can be used to garner favor and respect among your people.

To elevate your standing, you'll spend your accumulated points of Treasure or Valuable Resources. The following table outlines the cost for each increase in your status level:

**Status Level to Achieve**  
**Treasure/Resource Points Required**  
1 ............................. 12  
2 ............................. 24  
3 ............................. 36  
4 ............................. 48  
5 ............................. 60  
6 ............................. 72  

Feel free to acquire multiple ranks, just remember to calculate the cost for each new level individually. Use this opportunity to invest in your community, thereby weaving your influence deeper into the fabric of your setting.

### visit the tReasuRy oF youR Folk

"... his coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact." -- JRR Tolkien

When you find a powerful weapon, piece of equiptment, or piece of armor, you might choose to add it to your gear, setting aside your previous trusted equipment. During a Fellowship phase, you have the option to return to your homeland and entrust this significant item to your people for safekeeping.

Exchanging an item like this increases your Standing within your community:

â€¢ Fine item (1 Quality): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 3.
â€¢ Superior item (2 Qualities): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 5.
â€¢ Exceptional item (3 Qualities): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 6.

Moreover, the moment you decide to part with a faithful weapon or piece of armor is a significant one. Replacing your old gear with this newfound treasure redefines who you are within your community. You become known as the bearer of this enchanted object, and the item itself elevates into a 'cultural treasure' among your people."

### Tend to a Holding

"The care of a large estate can be such a heavy burden." - Daphne du Maurier, "Rebecca"

You have the choice to dedicate an entire season to maintaining your property. By selecting this course of action, you're granted the opportunity to roll a special die twice, opting for the most beneficial outcome when evaluating the state of your estate. If you have a specialty that applies to this situation, you'll earn an extra Advancement point as well.

Use this dedicated time wisely to make certain your estate is in prime condition, fully leveraging your expertise and available resources.

### Write a Song, Book, or other Piece of Art

"Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced." - Leo Tolstory in What is Art?

You choose to express yourself by creating a piece of art during a period of rest or inspiration. To bring your vision to life, you'll need to make an Art roll. The basic difficulty is steep, with a Target Number (TN) of 18. But if you find yourself in an inspiring location or if you have the Artist Trait, the difficulty eases to a TN of 16.

You can further adjust the challenge by selecting one of these modifiers:

- **Popular (-2 TN):** You opt for a style or theme familiar to a specific culture. While this makes your art more accessible to those from that culture, it becomes slightly more challenging for others to appreciate, increasing their TN by 2.
  
- **Thematic (-2 TN):** Your artwork focuses on a specific theme or subject and resonates most strongly under certain conditions.
  
- **Traditional / Ancient (+2 TN):** You delve into time-honored techniques and themes to create a piece rooted in tradition or antiquity. This work resonates deeply conveying the historical or cultural significance of the event.

If your roll is successful, the quality of that roll sets the bar for how challenging it is for others to truly appreciate or interpret your art. If you don't succeed, you struggle with your medium or message, but there's always another chance to try again later.

### Perform a Piece of Art

"Art is the most beautiful of all lies." - Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray

During your journey or in moments of reflection, you and your companions can choose to perform a piece of art. This enhances your mutual bonds and reinvigorates your collective purpose.

First, pick a piece of art from your collective portfolio. Then, each of you makes an Art roll.

- **If you succeed in your roll,** you find yourself Inspired for the rest of the session. This inspiration can be 'spent' to add 2 Success dice to any one future roll.
  
- **If the total number of successes from the group meets or exceeds the number of participants,** all of you gain a temporary Unity point, usable only for the current session.

Remember, each piece of art can be performed or engaged with only once during each period of respite (twice if it's an Abstract piece). Mark it off your list whether it was a success or not.

### Gain a New Feature or Specialty

"Change is the end result of all true learning." - Leo Buscaglia

After investing significant time and energy into your character, you may find that the current set of features or specialties no longer captures the essence of your evolving role. During a period of rest or reflection, you have the option to swap out an existing feature or specialty for a new one.

When considering this change, it's wise to exercise discretion. Switching out a feature or specialty doesn't mean you've forgotten old talents; rather, it indicates a shift in focus. Your character is putting aside a previous strength to cultivate new skills or attributes.

The new feature or specialty can be selected from any existing list, or you can even create your own. If you opt for the latter, you'll need to seek approval from the game master to ensure it fits within the broader context of your character's story and the game's world.

### Meet with your Patron

"A patron backs you with money, supplies, and support. In return, you make him a little more extraordinary by association." --- The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

A patron is usually someone renowned or powerful who might offer you and your company a reason to go adventuring, often also providing support and counsel. When you're spending the Fellowship phase in the location where a patron can be found, you have the option to meet with them, assuming they are available.

Your company can have multiple patrons at the same time, as long as you and your teammates can meet the conditions to secure their loyalty. More often than not, these patrons will expect something in return for their friendship.

### Establish a New Safe Haven

"Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to tread." - J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Lord of the Rings"

As you navigate through uncharted territories on your adventures, you'll inevitably come across locations that seem ideal for taking a breather during your downtime phases. If you've entered a new area and managed to build a friendly rapport with its inhabitants, you have the option to designate it as a safe haven. This grants you regular access to this locale for periods of rest and respite.

To officially establish a new safe haven, you and your companions must spend a downtime phase in the chosen location and select "Establish a New Safe Haven" as your current objective.

Completing this collective task strengthens your ties with key figures in the area, further cementing your alliance and welcome status.

### Earn a Title

"A name earned is more valuable than a name given." - Brandon Sanderson, "Elantris"

Your journeys can take you far from the familiar, leading you to accomplish deeds for communities different from your own. However, valor is universally recognized, even in lands foreign to you.

If you've executed commendably courageous acts during your adventuring phase in the territory or realm of a different community, you mayâ€”subject to your referee's approvalâ€”opt for the "Earn a Title" undertaking.

Choosing to "Earn a Title" generally implies two things:

- Your reputation now extends to another community. You can now influence the narrative of an end-of-year downtime phase as if you were a member of that community. Additionally, when you spend a downtime phase within the home settlement of that community, your reputation score is maintained, as if you've returned to your own home.
- You are granted a piece of property or a dwelling. The size and features of this land or home will be in line with your standard of living.

You have the possibility to earn titles from multiple different communities.

### Search for Answers

"The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible." - Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of the Future"

If you find yourself in a location with valuable resources for learningâ€”whether it's a library filled with ancient texts, a repository of historical artifacts, or a council of knowledgeable individualsâ€”you have the option to engage in "Search for Answers" as your current endeavor. To start, specify the topic you're interested in investigating. Then, make a Knowledge test, followed by an additional roll based on the table below. Your second roll gains a +1 modifier if you have a relevant Knowledge Specialty, +2 for a significant success on the Knowledge test, and +4 for an extraordinary success.

1-3. Fruitless Search: You've spent countless hours sifting through irrelevant documents and texts.
4-5. Helpful Insight: The guide must provide one useful piece of information about your chosen topic.
6-7. Valuable Intel: The guide must offer two useful pieces of information concerning your topic.
8-9. A Hidden Truth: Not only do you receive two pieces of useful information, but you also gain 1 Experience point.
10. Revealed Secrets: You've uncovered everything possible about the subject in your current location, regaining 1 point of Hope and gaining 1 Experience point.

Critical Failure: Forbidden Knowledge: Your thirst for knowledge has led you to uncover secrets best left hiddenâ€”gain 1 Shadow point.

### Rallying Allies

"Even the strongest of us cannot survive alone." - Terry Goodkind, "Stone of Tears"

You have the option to return to your base or hometown to leverage your connections and liaise with influential figures. Your goal is to boost your reputation within your community, temporarily increasing your Standing rating, usually in anticipation of a specific event or crisis.

Securing such support allows you to elevate your Standing rating at 1/6th the typical cost in resources. For example, you could raise your Standing from level 3 to 4 at the cost of just eight units of valuable resources, rather than the usual 48.

Be aware that this temporary boost in Standing will expire at the conclusion of the next end-of-year downtime phase. Make the most of it while you can.

### Heal Corrpution

You find yourself burdened by a growing inner corruption. It could be psychic residue from battling cosmic entities, ethical compromises made in a cybernetic underworld, or spiritual decay from wielding dark magic.

To counteract this taint, you may engage in a task that resonates with your core essence, attempting a Skill or Artistry check with a Target Number (TN) of 14. A successful roll will reduce your corruption scoreâ€”be it mental, spiritual, or moralâ€”by 2 points on a success, 4 points on a great success, and 6 points on an extraordinary success. Note that any permanent corruption gained during moments of extreme vulnerability cannot be healed.

If you spend your seasonal phase in a sanctuary, be it a high-tech medical lab, an ancient temple, or a secure bunker, you are entitled to two attempts to purge the darkness. If you've returned to your home base or personal haven, you may make a single attempt.

Individuals from various backgrounds employ unique methods to shed their corruption. For instance, a technologically enhanced human might delve into coding to reprogram their inner turmoil, a rogue detective may solve a case that restores their faith in humanity, and a wizard or shaman might compose, play, or recite incantations or hymns to purify their spirit.

### Patrol the Wild

"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter." - Soldier dialogue from Fallout: New Vegas

In any communityâ€”be it a far-flung space colony, a mystical elven enclave, a steampunk metropolis, or a post-apocalyptic survivor campâ€”there's a constant need for vigilant patrols to keep the borders secure from threats. You're welcome to join these crucial efforts during a Fellowship phase, whether it's to fend off alien invaders, rogue magicians, steam-powered automatons, or mutated creatures.

By choosing this undertaking, you gain the benefits of the specialized "Frontier Lore" for the duration of the following Adventuring phase. If you already possess "Frontier Lore," then you have the option to gain double benefits from a single Trait invocation during this time (for example, you could both automatically succeed at a roll and gain an Advancement point).

#### Family Heritage

Upon designating an heir, you have the opportunity to pass on one of your favored skills as a family inheritance. This skill should truly embody who you are, based on both gameplay and personal preference.

Should you retire or meet an untimely end, your heir inherits this skill as an additional favored skill. Moreover, whenever the heir employs this inherited skill, a single special die roll results in an extraordinary success.

#### Heirloom

You can also earmark a singularly wondrous artifact or a renowned weapon or armor to pass onto your heir.

The heir can claim this legacy item as a reward when their level of bravery allows it. Notably, any latent abilities within weapons or armor become automatically activated when claimed by the heir. In the case of wondrous artifacts, any hidden blessings are revealed when the heir takes possession of it.

These legacy items can never be exchanged to boost your social standing or be replaced by similar items; they are more than just objects. They are sacred legacies, intended to be passed down to a worthy successor and not discarded lightly.

#### Sombre Legacy

The burden of continuing a loved one's mission is heavy. Your heir starts their journey carrying 1 permanent Shadow point for each flaw you possessed at the time of your retirement or death

### theRe and back again (yeaRâ€™s end only)

"When he was gone from them, he was most himself, most free; yet when he was with them he felt he was known truly and without blindness, and he longed always to return to them from his voyages, his questions, his deeds and dreams." -- Ursula K. Le Guin's "A Wizard of Earthsea"

Should you choose to spend the final season of the year at home, immersing yourself in the safety and familiarity of your base of operationsâ€”be it a starship in a distant galaxy, a secluded mansion in a mystery-laden city, or a fortified settlement in a post-apocalyptic worldâ€”you may opt for this undertaking. This is your opportunity to fully engage with your family, friends, or community, reminding yourself why you venture into the perilous unknown in the first place.

As you sit by whatever serves as your comforting hearthâ€”be it an actual fireplace, the hum of a spacecraft's engine, or the flickering light of a lantern in a steampunk workshopâ€”you regain a sense of hope and purpose. Recover a number of Hope points equal to one-third of your starting Hope score, rounding down any fractions.

However, being in the close presence of those you hold dear also serves as a poignant reminder of what you stand to lose if you were to fail in your ongoing battles against the myriad threats lurking in your world. This realization adds a weight to your spirit, manifesting as 1 permanent Shadow point.

### Undertake a Journey -- Fix

"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all." - Helen Keller

Travel is an integral part of an adventurer's life, often full of unexpected challenges and opportunities for growth. When you decide to "Undertake a Journey," you and your companions set off to traverse the lands, seeking new experiences or fulfilling specific objectives.

#### Preparing for the Journey

Before setting out, you must choose a destination and determine the expected duration of the journey based on your pace and the terrain. Your game master will provide you with the Target Number (TN) for your Navigation rolls based on these factors.

#### Sample Modifiers

- **Guided (-2 TN):** If you have a local guide or a very accurate map, the difficulty eases by 2 TN.
  
- **Rushed (+2 TN):** Trying to reach your destination quickly increases the TN by 2, but reduces the journey's time by 25%.
  
- **Uncharted (+4 TN):** If you're in an unexplored or poorly mapped area, the TN for Navigation rolls increases by 4.
  
#### Outcomes

- **Successful Roll:** You've setoff without major hiccups. The game master may present minor encounters or findings.
- **Failed Roll:** Your party encounters difficulties setting started.  This could include such things as getting lost, facing hazardous weather, or stumbling upon dangerous wildlife.
- **Critical Success:** Your party finds a shortcut or an interesting landmark, possibly reducing the journey's time or offering a side quest.
- **Critical Failure:** Not only do you lose your way, but the party also faces a severe crisis that could include a deadly encounter, exhaustion, or loss of supplies.

#### Bonuses

- **If the total number of successes from the group exceeds the number of participants,** you reach your destination with some additional benefits like finding valuable resources or uncovering a hidden location.
  
- **If everyone in the group fails their roll,** the journey takes twice as long and you encounter significant dangers or setbacks.

#### Final Arrival

Upon reaching your destination, characters gain 1 Experience point. If you've successfully navigated an uncharted area, all participants also gain 1 point of Hope, recognizing the accomplishment of successfully navigating such challenging terrain.

Journeys can be thrilling, hazardous, enlightening, and transformative. But no matter the challenges you face, they're opportunities for you and your companions to grow stronger and wiser.

### MAKE A CONNECTION

When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion), roll +heart.

On a strong hit, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
On a weak hit, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.
On a miss, you you donâ€™t make a connection and the situation worsens.  Pay the Price.

### FORGE A BOND

When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a strong hit, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds legacy track per the connectionâ€™s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then, choose one.

âœ´ Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
âœ´ Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid you on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a weak hit, as above, but they ask something more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the request, and do it (or Swear an Iron Vow to see it done).

On a miss, they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the connectionâ€™s rank by one (if not already epic).

### AID a Connection

When you act in direct support of an ally, envision how you aid them. Then, Secure an Advantage or Gain Ground to take action.

If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you Gain Ground and score a strong hit, you are both in control.

On a weak hit, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.

### COMPEL a Connection

When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer, envision your approach. If youâ€¦

âœ´ Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
âœ´ Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
âœ´ Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow

On a strong hit, theyâ€™ll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.

On a weak hit, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.

On a miss, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. Pay the Price.

### TEST YOUR RELATIONSHIP

When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a strong hit, Develop Your Relationship.

On a weak hit, Develop Your Relationship, but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a miss, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.
âœ´ Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and Pay the Price.
âœ´ Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and Swear an Iron Vow (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail, the connection is permanently undone.

### DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP

When you reinforce your relationship with a connection by doing any of the followingâ€¦
âœ´ swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
âœ´ completing a quest to their benefit
âœ´ leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
âœ´ giving them something of worth
âœ´ sharing a profound moment
âœ´ standing with them against hardship
âœ´ overcoming a test of your relationship

â€¦you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. On a strong hit, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a strong hit with a match, you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connectionâ€™s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic). On a we
