### Courting a Spouse

You might consciously steer clear of close relationships, well aware of the peril that comes with your adventurous lifestyle, especially when pitted against the Shadow. Yet, having friends, family, and a place to call home gives you something to fight for. You might find yourself captivated by a Loremaster you've met on your journeys. Alternatively, you might see the strategic value of sealing an alliance through marriage. When you decide the time is ripe for your hero to marry, that's a decision only you can make.

If you want to dive into a relationship, whether romantic or not, consult your Referee and bring it up during the Seasonal phase of the game. Aiming to get married? Then you'll need to court that Loremaster who's caught your eye. Courting isn't casual; it's a formal declaration that you're interested in marrying the person you're courting. Different cultures have their own nuances around this—some may demand extravagant gifts, while others simply require mutual intent to marry. If you're of noble birth or serve a sworn lord, you'll generally need to seek your lord’s blessing to tie the knot.

Bear in mind, successful courting takes time and patience. Your potential partner will likely mull over the risks associated with your hazardous "profession" before making a decision.


### Write a Song, Book, or other Piece of Art 
"Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced." - Leo Tolstory in What is Art?

You choose to express yourself by creating a piece of art during a period of rest or inspiration. To bring your vision to life, you'll need to make an Art roll. The basic difficulty is steep, with a Target Number (TN) of 18. But if you find yourself in an inspiring location or if you have the Artist Trait, the difficulty eases to a TN of 16.

You can further adjust the challenge by selecting one of these modifiers:

- **Popular (-2 TN):** You opt for a style or theme familiar to a specific culture. While this makes your art more accessible to those from that culture, it becomes slightly more challenging for others to appreciate, increasing their TN by 2.
  
- **Thematic (-2 TN):** Your artwork focuses on a specific theme or subject and resonates most strongly under certain conditions.
  
- **Traditional / Ancient (+2 TN):** You delve into time-honored techniques and themes to create a piece rooted in tradition or antiquity. This work resonates deeply conveying the historical or cultural significance of the event.

If your roll is successful, the quality of that roll sets the bar for how challenging it is for others to truly appreciate or interpret your art. If you don't succeed, you struggle with your medium or message, but there's always another chance to try again later.

### Perform a Piece of Art
"Art is the most beautiful of all lies." - Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray 

During your journey or in moments of reflection, you and your companions can choose to perform a piece of art. This enhances your mutual bonds and reinvigorates your collective purpose.

First, pick a piece of art from your collective portfolio. Then, each of you makes an Art roll.

- **If you succeed in your roll,** you find yourself Inspired for the rest of the session. This inspiration can be 'spent' to add 2 Success dice to any one future roll.
  
- **If the total number of successes from the group meets or exceeds the number of participants,** all of you gain a temporary Unity point, usable only for the current session.

Remember, each piece of art can be performed or engaged with only once during each period of respite (twice if it's an Abstract piece). Mark it off your list whether it was a success or not.


### Gain a New Feature or Specialty

"Change is the end result of all true learning." - Leo Buscaglia

After investing significant time and energy into your character, you may find that the current set of features or specialties no longer captures the essence of your evolving role. During a period of rest or reflection, you have the option to swap out an existing feature or specialty for a new one.

When considering this change, it's wise to exercise discretion. Switching out a feature or specialty doesn't mean you've forgotten old talents; rather, it indicates a shift in focus. Your character is putting aside a previous strength to cultivate new skills or attributes.

The new feature or specialty can be selected from any existing list, or you can even create your own. If you opt for the latter, you'll need to seek approval from the game master to ensure it fits within the broader context of your character's story and the game's world.

### Meet with your Patron

"A patron backs you with money, supplies, and support. In return, you make him a little more extraordinary by association." --- The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

A patron is usually someone renowned or powerful who might offer you and your company a reason to go adventuring, often also providing support and counsel. When you're spending the Fellowship phase in the location where a patron can be found, you have the option to meet with them, assuming they are available.

Your company can have multiple patrons at the same time, as long as you and your teammates can meet the conditions to secure their loyalty. More often than not, these patrons will expect something in return for their friendship.

### Establish a New Safe Haven

"Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to tread." - J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Lord of the Rings"

As you navigate through uncharted territories on your adventures, you'll inevitably come across locations that seem ideal for taking a breather during your downtime phases. If you've entered a new area and managed to build a friendly rapport with its inhabitants, you have the option to designate it as a safe haven. This grants you regular access to this locale for periods of rest and respite.

To officially establish a new safe haven, you and your companions must spend a downtime phase in the chosen location and select "Establish a New Safe Haven" as your current objective.

Completing this collective task strengthens your ties with key figures in the area, further cementing your alliance and welcome status.


### Earn a Title

"A name earned is more valuable than a name given." - Brandon Sanderson, "Elantris"

Your journeys can take you far from the familiar, leading you to accomplish deeds for communities different from your own. However, valor is universally recognized, even in lands foreign to you.

If you've executed commendably courageous acts during your adventuring phase in the territory or realm of a different community, you may—subject to your referee's approval—opt for the "Earn a Title" undertaking.

Choosing to "Earn a Title" generally implies two things:

* Your reputation now extends to another community. You can now influence the narrative of an end-of-year downtime phase as if you were a member of that community. Additionally, when you spend a downtime phase within the home settlement of that community, your reputation score is maintained, as if you've returned to your own home.
* You are granted a piece of property or a dwelling. The size and features of this land or home will be in line with your standard of living.

You have the possibility to earn titles from multiple different communities.


### Search for Answers

"The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible." - Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of the Future"

If you find yourself in a location with valuable resources for learning—whether it's a library filled with ancient texts, a repository of historical artifacts, or a council of knowledgeable individuals—you have the option to engage in "Search for Answers" as your current endeavor. To start, specify the topic you're interested in investigating. Then, make a Knowledge test, followed by an additional roll based on the table below. Your second roll gains a +1 modifier if you have a relevant Knowledge Specialty, +2 for a significant success on the Knowledge test, and +4 for an extraordinary success.

1-3. Fruitless Search: You've spent countless hours sifting through irrelevant documents and texts.
4-5. Helpful Insight: The guide must provide one useful piece of information about your chosen topic.
6-7. Valuable Intel: The guide must offer two useful pieces of information concerning your topic.
8-9. A Hidden Truth: Not only do you receive two pieces of useful information, but you also gain 1 Experience point.
10. Revealed Secrets: You've uncovered everything possible about the subject in your current location, regaining 1 point of Hope and gaining 1 Experience point.

Critical Failure: Forbidden Knowledge: Your thirst for knowledge has led you to uncover secrets best left hidden—gain 1 Shadow point.

### Rallying Allies

"Even the strongest of us cannot survive alone." - Terry Goodkind, "Stone of Tears"

You have the option to return to your base or hometown to leverage your connections and liaise with influential figures. Your goal is to boost your reputation within your community, temporarily increasing your Standing rating, usually in anticipation of a specific event or crisis.

Securing such support allows you to elevate your Standing rating at 1/6th the typical cost in resources. For example, you could raise your Standing from level 3 to 4 at the cost of just eight units of valuable resources, rather than the usual 48.

Be aware that this temporary boost in Standing will expire at the conclusion of the next end-of-year downtime phase. Make the most of it while you can.

### Heal Corrpution

You find yourself burdened by a growing inner corruption. It could be psychic residue from battling cosmic entities, ethical compromises made in a cybernetic underworld, or spiritual decay from wielding dark magic. 

To counteract this taint, you may engage in a task that resonates with your core essence, attempting a Skill or Artistry check with a Target Number (TN) of 14. A successful roll will reduce your corruption score—be it mental, spiritual, or moral—by 2 points on a success, 4 points on a great success, and 6 points on an extraordinary success. Note that any permanent corruption gained during moments of extreme vulnerability cannot be healed.

If you spend your seasonal phase in a sanctuary, be it a high-tech medical lab, an ancient temple, or a secure bunker, you are entitled to two attempts to purge the darkness. If you've returned to your home base or personal haven, you may make a single attempt.

Individuals from various backgrounds employ unique methods to shed their corruption. For instance, a technologically enhanced human might delve into coding to reprogram their inner turmoil, a rogue detective may solve a case that restores their faith in humanity, and a wizard or shaman might compose, play, or recite incantations or hymns to purify their spirit.


### Raise Standard of Living

"Champagne arrived, in a bucket of crushed ice, as if it were the most commonplace thing in the world." - "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Having a stash of valuable resources gives you the freedom to live more comfortably. If you decide to spend some downtime at your base or home, you have the option to dip into your assets to enhance your quality of life. This could cover everything from daily expenses to acquiring new gear.

It costs 1 unit of assets to maintain a Prosperous lifestyle for one month, and 2 units for Rich one. At the end of the month, you'll need to spend the same amount again to keep living at that standard, or else you'll revert to your previous way of life.

Feel free to invest as much of your assets as you desire to sustain an elevated standard of living for an extended period.


### Raise Standing

"Status is your position on the playing field of life. Status is your true wealth." - from "American Psycho" by Bret Easton Ellis

Your hard-earned riches can be a powerful tool, not just for personal gain, but for increasing your influence and stature within your community, whether it's a far-future space station, a steampunk metropolis, or a post-apocalyptic tribe. Considerable in both material and immaterial realms, these assets can be used to garner favor and respect among your people.

To elevate your standing, you'll spend your accumulated points of Treasure or Valuable Resources. The following table outlines the cost for each increase in your status level:

**Status Level to Achieve**  
**Treasure/Resource Points Required**  
1 ............................. 12  
2 ............................. 24  
3 ............................. 36  
4 ............................. 48  
5 ............................. 60  
6 ............................. 72  

Feel free to acquire multiple ranks, just remember to calculate the cost for each new level individually. Use this opportunity to invest in your community, thereby weaving your influence deeper into the fabric of your setting.

### Patrol the Wild

"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter." - Soldier dialogue from Fallout: New Vegas

In any community—be it a far-flung space colony, a mystical elven enclave, a steampunk metropolis, or a post-apocalyptic survivor camp—there's a constant need for vigilant patrols to keep the borders secure from threats. You're welcome to join these crucial efforts during a Fellowship phase, whether it's to fend off alien invaders, rogue magicians, steam-powered automatons, or mutated creatures.

By choosing this undertaking, you gain the benefits of the specialized "Frontier Lore" for the duration of the following Adventuring phase. If you already possess "Frontier Lore," then you have the option to gain double benefits from a single Trait invocation during this time (for example, you could both automatically succeed at a roll and gain an Advancement point).

### Tend to Holding

"The care of a large estate can be such a heavy burden." - Daphne du Maurier, "Rebecca"

You have the choice to dedicate an entire season to maintaining your property. By selecting this course of action, you're granted the opportunity to roll a special die twice, opting for the most beneficial outcome when evaluating the state of your estate. If you have a specialty that applies to this situation, you'll earn an extra Advancement point as well.

Use this dedicated time wisely to make certain your estate is in prime condition, fully leveraging your expertise and available resources.


### Name an Heir

"In his will he hath bequeathed to you his mansion, his plate, his money and his lands." - William Shakespeare, "Much Ado About Nothing"

An heir isn't just someone who inherits your belongings; they are a person in whom you see a fragment of yourself, a successor to continue your battle against the forces of darkness. Initially, the heir is a non-player character, but they will become a playable character if and when you leave the story for any reason.

When you choose this undertaking, you must name an heir and note it on your character sheet. You immediately gain 1 point of Hope, representing your aspirations for your heir's future. Conversely, if your chosen heir meets an unfortunate end, you instantly receive 4 Shadow points.

This choice is a one-time event; you can't name another heir later.

#### Family Heritage

Upon designating an heir, you have the opportunity to pass on one of your favored skills as a family inheritance. This skill should truly embody who you are, based on both gameplay and personal preference.

Should you retire or meet an untimely end, your heir inherits this skill as an additional favored skill. Moreover, whenever the heir employs this inherited skill, a single special die roll results in an extraordinary success.

#### Heirloom

You can also earmark a singularly wondrous artifact or a renowned weapon or armor to pass onto your heir.

The heir can claim this legacy item as a reward when their level of bravery allows it. Notably, any latent abilities within weapons or armor become automatically activated when claimed by the heir. In the case of wondrous artifacts, any hidden blessings are revealed when the heir takes possession of it.

These legacy items can never be exchanged to boost your social standing or be replaced by similar items; they are more than just objects. They are sacred legacies, intended to be passed down to a worthy successor and not discarded lightly.

#### Sombre Legacy

The burden of continuing a loved one's mission is heavy. Your heir starts their journey carrying 1 permanent Shadow point for each flaw you possessed at the time of your retirement or death

### visit the tReasuRy oF youR Folk
"... his coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact." -- JRR Tolkien

When you find a powerful weapon, piece of equiptment, or piece of armor, you might choose to add it to your gear, setting aside your previous trusted equipment. During a Fellowship phase, you have the option to return to your homeland and entrust this significant item to your people for safekeeping.

Exchanging an item like this increases your Standing within your community:

• Fine item (1 Quality): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 3.
• Superior item (2 Qualities): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 5.
• Exceptional item (3 Qualities): Gain 1 Standing, up to a max of 6.

Moreover, the moment you decide to part with a faithful weapon or piece of armor is a significant one. Replacing your old gear with this newfound treasure redefines who you are within your community. You become known as the bearer of this enchanted object, and the item itself elevates into a 'cultural treasure' among your people."


### theRe and back again (yeaR’s end only)

"When he was gone from them, he was most himself, most free; yet when he was with them he felt he was known truly and without blindness, and he longed always to return to them from his voyages, his questions, his deeds and dreams." -- Ursula K. Le Guin's "A Wizard of Earthsea"

Should you choose to spend the final season of the year at home, immersing yourself in the safety and familiarity of your base of operations—be it a starship in a distant galaxy, a secluded mansion in a mystery-laden city, or a fortified settlement in a post-apocalyptic world—you may opt for this undertaking. This is your opportunity to fully engage with your family, friends, or community, reminding yourself why you venture into the perilous unknown in the first place.

As you sit by whatever serves as your comforting hearth—be it an actual fireplace, the hum of a spacecraft's engine, or the flickering light of a lantern in a steampunk workshop—you regain a sense of hope and purpose. Recover a number of Hope points equal to one-third of your starting Hope score, rounding down any fractions.

However, being in the close presence of those you hold dear also serves as a poignant reminder of what you stand to lose if you were to fail in your ongoing battles against the myriad threats lurking in your world. This realization adds a weight to your spirit, manifesting as 1 permanent Shadow point.

### Undertake a Journey -- Fix

"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all." - Helen Keller

Travel is an integral part of an adventurer's life, often full of unexpected challenges and opportunities for growth. When you decide to "Undertake a Journey," you and your companions set off to traverse the lands, seeking new experiences or fulfilling specific objectives.

#### Preparing for the Journey

Before setting out, you must choose a destination and determine the expected duration of the journey based on your pace and the terrain. Your game master will provide you with the Target Number (TN) for your Navigation rolls based on these factors.

#### Sample Modifiers

- **Guided (-2 TN):** If you have a local guide or a very accurate map, the difficulty eases by 2 TN.
  
- **Rushed (+2 TN):** Trying to reach your destination quickly increases the TN by 2, but reduces the journey's time by 25%.
  
- **Uncharted (+4 TN):** If you're in an unexplored or poorly mapped area, the TN for Navigation rolls increases by 4.
  
#### Outcomes

- **Successful Roll:** You've setoff without major hiccups. The game master may present minor encounters or findings.
- **Failed Roll:** Your party encounters difficulties setting started.  This could include such things as getting lost, facing hazardous weather, or stumbling upon dangerous wildlife. 
- **Critical Success:** Your party finds a shortcut or an interesting landmark, possibly reducing the journey's time or offering a side quest.
- **Critical Failure:** Not only do you lose your way, but the party also faces a severe crisis that could include a deadly encounter, exhaustion, or loss of supplies.

#### Bonuses

- **If the total number of successes from the group exceeds the number of participants,** you reach your destination with some additional benefits like finding valuable resources or uncovering a hidden location.
  
- **If everyone in the group fails their roll,** the journey takes twice as long and you encounter significant dangers or setbacks.

#### Final Arrival
Upon reaching your destination, characters gain 1 Experience point. If you've successfully navigated an uncharted area, all participants also gain 1 point of Hope, recognizing the accomplishment of successfully navigating such challenging terrain.

Journeys can be thrilling, hazardous, enlightening, and transformative. But no matter the challenges you face, they're opportunities for you and your companions to grow stronger and wiser.
