I remember employees here at SCE that never adopted email, the web, mobile, and social media.  They were the holdouts.  They were the ones who never got on the bus.   They are the ones who never adopted technologies like Outlook, Lotus Notes, blackberrys, palm pilots, the phone, or the Web.   And they are no longer here.  They are gone.  They were not fired, they were not even laid off.  They retired.  They left.  They were out competed by those who did embrace the change, adapted and learned, and who took the risk to try new things. 

There is a whole theory around this called the Chasm Theory.  It was developed by Geoffrey Moore in his book *Crossing the Chasm*.  The theory is that there is a chasm between the early adopters of a technology and the early majority.  The early adopters are the ones who are willing to take risks and try new things.  They are the ones who are willing to embrace the change

So where is AI in this adoption curve?  Where is the World?  Where is California, and Where is SCE?  I saw AI back in college in the last century.  I saw it used in story telling and in article writing during the explosion of blogging and social media.  It was groundbreaking how business writers and sports writers could get their how style and content written by a bot.  It was amazing how you would automate the testing of an application.  I remember our first bot here at SCE, logging into our bank and processing bounced checks and credit cards.  We had someone who was a CPA doing data entry full time, and now they could work on real problems.  Problems they never thought they could because there was never enough time.  Yet, even something as groundbreaking as AI or Automation or Content Generation was it lingered quietly for many years, obvious only to those of us who lived close enough to see its brilliance.

Within my circle - the circles of innovators and early adopters AI was clearly the future. But outside my bubble, most people remained unaware or indifferent.  When I talk to my family and their friends I'm told that that the people outside the bubble outnumber those who are inside the bubble by 50 to 1.

But let me make my point clearly.  AI has crossed The Chasm. It is no longer interesting.  It is demonstratably the way of the future.  My Proof?

Fortune 500 companies are massive vessels that shift with deliberation have begun adopting AI. In fact, seventy percent of them now employ AI officially in some form. LAst year the number of UNITE companies that had deployed Copilot was very low.  Now its almost all of them.  For me, when a majority of the Fortune 500 integrates a technology into their business fabric, it's no longer emerging—it's arrived.  When a utility integrates a technology, its arrived at utilities. 

You could argue that you should approach this from the perspective of Total Addressable Market (TAM).  Lets look at that innovators and early adopters represent merely four percent (1 in 25) of a global user base numbering around five billion (computer and mobile users). That means reaching 200 million users signifies crossing the chasm. By this strict numeric threshold, AI might still seem niche.  However OpenAI announced that ChatGPT had over 800,000,000 active users in April 2025.  So by that measure, AI has not only crossed the chasm but has also soared far beyond it.  The only gap is that they are not paying for it. But that is a matter of time.  The technology is here and the demand is real.  And people are doing something that's beyond interesting with it. They are doing something useful with it. 

Yet, to me, sheer numbers aren't the sole indicator. My viewpoint draws from experience—like when I first encountered technologies like websites in the mid 1990's.  I had the same experience when I saw Palm making devices that were finally usable.  Another big change was when I virtualized my first server and I no longer had to worry about driving down to 1 Wilshire to fix my hardware late at night.

Today's tools like Copilot for M365 and GitHub Copilot and BMC Helix GPT, and others—are not just cool; they're transformative. There's a simple test: if you remove a technology do users scramble to get it back?  If so, then you've got something enduring. If SCE blocked ChatGPT overnight, what would happen?  

Well, the answer is clear: 97% of people who have access to Copilot 365 are using it.  Overall adoption of AI tools at SCE has now gotten to 17.15% of our workforce.  And that number is growing rapidly.  I can see it in the data and I can see it in the conversations I have with all of you.  People are using these tools to get work done faster and better.  You are not just playing with it, you are using to do something important.  What a number above 16% means is that we are now at a point where the people are no longer just playing with the AI, they are using the AI tools to get their work done.  This is a huge milestone for us and it shows that we are on the right track.  We are not just talking about AI, we are using it to get our work done.

Yet, beyond the numbers, it's the deeper implications I find fascinating and a bit unsettling.  We are now at the cusp of a new era, one that will redefine our work and lives. The question isn't whether AI has crossed the chasm; it's how we will adapt to this new reality. And what will we look like once we get adoption numbers above 33%?  What will we look like when we get to 50%?  What will we look like when we get to 84%?  I think that is the real question.  And I think that is the question that we need to be asking ourselves.

You will note though I ended at 84%.  The reason for this is that past adoption curves show that once you get to 84% adoption, that's about as far as you can get an adoption before the hold outs who will never adopt the technology live.  It's where those people live who never adopted email, the web, mobile, and social media. They never jumped the chasm.

So how can you jump that chasm?  How can you make sure that you are not one of those people who never makes it to the other side?  How can you make sure that you are not one of those people who never gets on the bus?  How can you make sure that you are not one of those people who never adopts the technology?

The answer is simple: you have to embrace the change.  You have to be willing to learn and adapt.  You have to be willing to take risks and try new things.  You have to be willing to step outside your comfort zone and embrace the unknown.

Micah Kaufman, CEO of Fiverr, recently addressed his employees with stark candor about AI's rapid approach. He spoke bluntly, warning that AI isn’t merely supplementing roles; it's coming directly for them if they are unwilling to change—for programmers, designers, lawyers, product managers, even CEOs and other executives like himself.

His words resonate deeply: what we once found easy will vanish; what was challenging will become routine; and what we thought impossible will be merely hard. Without striving to master your craft, he warned, career obsolescence looms frighteningly near. It wasn’t a threat, but rather an earnest call: wake up, adapt, and embrace the profound shift happening right before our eyes.

Kaufman offered practical wisdom to navigate these turbulent waters:

1. Master new AI tools relevant to your role, turning them into your superpowers.  
2. Seek mentors who grasp AI deeply and learn from them.
3. Work smarter, faster, more efficiently—not as if it were still yesterday.
4. Become adept at prompt engineering; it is the new fundamental skill.
5. Advocate proactively for organizational efficiency through AI.
6. Deeply understand and actively contribute to your company's strategic direction.
7. Create your own opportunities to learn and grow; waiting passively won't suffice.

Some saw his message as alarming.  But his message wasn’t; it was profoundly hopeful yet realistic—a truth delivered with  urgency. AI itself may not take your job, he reminded us, but someone who knows how to leveraging AI surely will be competing with you for that job.

Reflecting on this, I'm reminded how the greatest shifts in technology have always felt both exhilarating and daunting. As we move forward, the question isn’t whether AI has crossed the chasm—it's how we choose to respond to this undeniable reality. Will we rise, adapt, and thrive? Or will we cling stubbornly to familiar comforts, risking obsolescence?
