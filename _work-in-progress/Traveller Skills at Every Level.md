# Comprehensive Guide to Traveller 2E Skills and Actions

This guide covers all skills in **Traveller (Mongoose 2nd Edition)** – including those introduced in official supplements – and provides example actions for each skill. Each skill section begins with a brief description (citing official rules where available) and lists common activities or tasks using that skill. Actions are categorized by typical timeframes (from seconds to days) and note the **associated characteristic** (which may vary by context). Game Masters and players can use these examples for quick reference, from swift combat maneuvers to long-term downtime projects.

## Admin (Administration)  
*Admin* covers bureaucratic  ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=Hours%20One%20day%20Researching%20a,ship))tive tasks, from handling paperwork to navigating complex regulations. It represents the character’s ability to work within systems of rules and red tape.  

- **Rapid Regulation Recall** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly recall an obscure rule, law, or regulation to advise a snap decision. For example, remembering a cargo code or local statute in the middle of a tense negotiation.  
- **Hasty Form Filing** *(EDU, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Quickly fill out or stamp a simple form under pressure. This could be during a tight deadline or even while nsuring the paperwork is *just* sufficient to satisfy procedure.  
- **Rapid File Search** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Rummage through physical or digital files to find a specific document in under a minute. For example, locating a starport landing permit in a cluttered data system before an inspector arrives.  
- **Process Routine Paperwork** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Handle a minor bureaucratic task or log entry in a few minutes. This might include updating a ship’s manifest or logging a visitor – routine tasks that take only a moment of concentration.  
- **Compile Brief Report** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Write a short summary or incident report (e.g. an expense report or after-action memo) in under an hour. The Admin skill ensures it’s properly formatted and contains the needed info.  
- **Navigate Red Tape** *(SOC or INT, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours going through bureaucracy to get what you need. For example, securing a minor permit or clearance by visiting offices, filling forms, and knowing who to talk to.  
- **Conduct Internal Audit** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Perform a thorough review of records over a half or full day. This could uncover discrepancies in accounts or compliance issues in an organization’s paperwork.  
- **Reorganize Archives** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, sort out a chaotic filing system or database. You might be digitizing old files or categorizing data properly, making future access far easier.  
- **Draft Policy Document** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Take several days to write or revise a complex policy or legal document. This long task might involve consulting regulations, ensuring compliance, and producing a formal handbook or treaty text.

## Advocate (Legal)  
*Advocate* provides knowledge of legal codes and practices (especially interstellar law). It’s used for legal actions from quick advice to lengthy court cases.

- **Precedent Recall** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly remember a relevant law or case precedent in the heat of debate. For example, during a trial or negotiation, you cite a case by name to strengthen your position on the spot.  
- **Spot Legal Loophole** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a matter of seconds, scan a contract or law text to catch a loophole or ambiguous clause. A quick glance by a skilled Advocate can reveal an opening to exploit or a trap to avoid.  
- **Impromptu Objection** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Formulate and voice a brief but effective objection or argument within a minute. This is used in courtroom settings or negotiations when you need to immediately counter the opposition with a rule or point of order.  
- **Draft Quick Clause** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Compose a short legal clause or amendment in a few minutes. For instance, writing a quick contract addendum or travel waiver while clients wait, ensuring it’s legally sound despite the haste.  
- **On-the-Spot Legal Counsel** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Provide a rapid legal consultation or analysis of a situation within an hour. You might analyze a contract’s key points or explain a suspect’s rights at a police station, covering the essentials on short notice.  
- **Case Research** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours researching case law or statutes relevant to an issue. This could be digging into law databases or archives to find supporting precedents, building a stronger case for later use.  
- **Prepare Legal Brief** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Write a detailed brief or legal argument over the course of a day. You gather facts, cite laws, and lay out a position on a case or negotiation, producing a document that can be presented to a court or mediator.  
- **Extended Negotiation** *(SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Negotiate a major deal or mediate a complex dispute over a couple of days. Using Advocate skill, you handle contract drafts, proposals, and counter-proposals – for example, brokering a multi-system trade agreement or peace treaty clause by clause.  
- **Conduct Trial** *(SOC/INT, 1D days)* – Over days of work, represent a client in a full trial or arbitration. You deliver opening statements, examine witnesses, and make legal arguments each day. Advocate skill ensures you follow procedure and use law effectively throughout a prolonged legal proceeding.

## Animals  
*Animals* skill covers caring for and training animals – a rarity on highly industrial worlds. Specialties include Riding, Veterinary medicine, Training, and Farming, but all share the understanding of animal behavior and needs.

- **Soothing Whisper** *(SOC or INT, 1D seconds)* – Calm a startled or aggressive animal instantly with a soft wordA skilled handler can, in a second or two, prevent a panicked horse from bolting or a guard dog from barking by using tone and body language.  
- **Quick Mount/Dismount** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Swiftly get on or off a trained animal in a half dozen seconds. This action is useful if you need to evacuate fast or hop onto a moving beast; a riding specialist does it smoothly without spooking the animal.  
- **Training Command** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Issue a learned command to an animal and get near-instant obedience. Within a minute or less, you can have a dog fetch or a falcon take flight and return. The *Animals (training)* specialty shines here, reinforcing behaviors you’ve taught.  
- **Field Triage (Animal)** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Perform first aid on an injured animal in a few minutes. This could mean cleaning and bandaging a wound on a pet or livestock, stabilizing the creature until more thorough veterinary care can be given.  
- **Track Animal Signs** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour looking for signs of animals in the area. You might find and follow tracks, scat, or broken foliage. This activity uses knowledge of animal habits to infer direction and type of creature – a narrative use of Animals skill akin to Recon in wilderness.  
- **Herd Management** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, tend and direct a group of animals. For example, leading a herd to water or rotating a flock’s grazing field. You anticipate the group’s needs and handle minor issues (a straying member, a predator’s presence) during the period.  
- **Extended Training Session** *(INT or SOC, 1D x 4 hours)* – Devote half a day to teaching an animal new tricks or behaviors. This downtime task could involve repeat exercises, rewards, and corrections. The *Training* specialty allows you to make significant progress in obedience or skill (like teaching a creature to respond to whistle commands).  
- **Veterinary Treatment** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Treat an illness or injury in an animal over a couple of days. For instance, nursing a sick livestock animal back to health or performing surgery on a wounded creature. This uses veterinary knowledge to diagnose and apply medicine, with time for recovery and observation.  
- **Farm or Breed Animals** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Over several days, care for animals as they breed, give birth, or undergo a seasonal change. A farmer might supervise cattle birthing over a week, or an alien creature specialist might raise hatchlings. The *Animals (farming)* specialty or veterinary experience helps ensure healthy outcomes over this prolonged task.

## Athletics  
*Athletics* represents physical fitness and trained bodily skill. It has specialties: **Coordination** (throwing, climbing, etc.), **Endurance** (long exertion), **Strength** (feats of power), and **Flying** (for species capable of flight). Even without a specialty, Athletics covers general physical actions.

- **Reflexive Catch** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Snatch a falling object or grab a ledge in an instant. With a split-second reaction, you might catch a dropped data-pad or a slipping comrade, using your coordination to act faster than thought.  
- **Sprint Burst** *(END, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Run at top speed for a very short duration (a few combat rounds). In 6–36 seconds you cover a significant distance (20–100+ meters) by pushing your body to the max. Useful for dashing across a street under fire or closing distance in a fight.  
- **Climb Obstacle** *(STR or DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Hoist yourself over a wall or up a few meters of rope in under a minute. This quick climb might get you onto a ledge or out of a pit before something dangerous occurs. *Athletics (strength)* helps with brute force climbs, whereas *Athletics (co-ordination)* helps with agility-focused climbing.  
- **Long Jump Prep** *(STR, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to prepare and execute a long jump or throw. You stretch, gauge distances, and then make the leap or hurl an object with maximum power. This could be used to jump across a chasm or throw a grapnel line accurately to a rooftop.  
- **Endurance Run** *(END, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Jog or run continuously for 10–60 minutes. Covering multiple kilometers, you maintain a steady pace. This might be used when chasing someone across town or escaping a threat on foot when vehicles aren’t available.  
- **Marathon Trek** *(END, 1D hours)* – Engage in strenuous several hours. Examples include hiking up a mountain trail for 1–6 hours or swimming across a large lake. This tests pure stamina; *Athletics (endurance)* would reduce fatigue and allow you to keep going.  
- **Intensive Training** *(END or DEX, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day in physical training or practice. This could be a military-style obstacle course, a lengthy sports match, or a multi-hour gymnastics practice. Over 4–24 hours you build skill and fitness; narratively, it can justify increases in physical abilities during downtime.  
- **Adventure Race** *(END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Participate in a multi-event physical competition or a continuous expedition lasting a couple of days (10–60 hours). You might be climbing, paddling, and running in stages. Athletic skill helps manage exertion and techniques across the entire event (with short rests between legs).  
- **Expedition March** *(END, 1D days)* – Traverse difficult terrain on foot over 1–6 days. Perhaps you’re crossing a desert or dense jungle without vehicles. This involves marching for many hours each day, setting camps, and enduring weather. Athletics skill (especially Endurance) helps prevent exhaustion and injury over the long haul.

## Art  
*Art* is the skill of creative expression, encompassing many forms and media. Specialties include Acting, Dance, Holography, Instrument, Sculpting, Writing, etc., but all allow a character to produce inspiring or entertaining creations.

- **Expressive Flourish** *(SOC/DEX, 1D seconds)* – Perform a tiny artistic flourish on the spot. An actor might flash a convincing facial expression or an orator a dramatic gesture; a dancer could strike a pose. In a one- or two-second window, you convey emotion or meaning artistically (perhaps to influence someone’s reaction subtly).  
- **Quick Sketch** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Draw a rapid doodle or outline in a few moments. In 6–36 seconds, you produce a recognizable sketch of a person or a schematic idea. This could be used to communicate an idea visually under time pressure (like sketching a creature you saw to show others).  
- **Impromptu Riff** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – If musically inclined, play a short riff or melody from memory or improvise one in under a minute. A pianist might tap out a tune on a bar’s keyboard to catch attention, or a singer hum a quick motif – a useful trick for morale or distraction.  
- **Short Performance** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Give a brief performance lasting a few minutes. This could be telling a captivating anecdote with acting skill, performing a single dance routine, or reading a quick poem you wrote. In 1–6 minutes, you entertain or move the audience, making *Art (acting or dance)* skills shine in social encounters.  
- **Compose a Poem or Tune** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Create a simple artistic piece in an hour or less. For example, writing a haiku or a heartfelt letter, composing a short jingle or melody, or sketching a small portrait. This is a creative burst yielding a rough but complete piece of art.  
- **Create Artwork** *(DEX, 1D hours)* – Work for several hours on a piece of art. Perhaps you paint a portrait, sculpt a small statue, or shoot and edit a short holo-video. In 1–6 hours you can produce a polished piece if uninterrupted – maybe not a masterpiece, but something saleable or display-worthy.  
- **Rehearse Role or Routine** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a day practicing a performance. An actor runs through scenes to perfect delivery; a band practices a setlist; a dancer drills choreography. After 4–24 hours of focused rehearsal, you are ready to present at peak quality.  
- **Compose Major Work** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Devote a couple of days to creating a significant artistic work. For example, writing a chapter of a novel, composing a symphonic movement, or filming a lengthy holo-drama scene. Over 10–60 hours you generate substantial creative output, likely requiring refinement later but establishing the core of a major piece.  
- **Produce Masterpiece** *(INT/EDU, 1D days)* – Over the course of 1–6 days (perhaps even consecutive weeks of evenings), craft an extensive and high-quality work of art. This might be finishing a novel, painting a mural on a starport wall, or programming a complex interactive holo. Such a project uses *Art* skill to its fullest and could become renowned in-game if successful.

## Astrogation  
*Astrogation* is used for plotting starship courses and calculating accurate Jump routes. Navigators rely on this skill to ensure ships arrive at the right place and avoid misjumps.

- **Recognize Starfield** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – With a glance out a viewscreen or at a star chart, identify a familiar constellation or known navigation beacon. In a second or two, you orient yourself in space by maatterns – helpful if you exit jump in an unknown area or need to verify which system you’re in.  
- **Emergency Course Correction** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – On the fly, adjust the ship’s plotted course to avoid a sudden hazard (like a surprise asteroid or debris field). Within 6–36 seconds (a few combat rounds), you recalc a minor vector change and feed it to the helm, preventing disaster without a full replot.  
- **Feasibility Check** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute to assess whether a particular jump is possible. By quickly consulting nav data, you estimate required Jump fuel and any limits (e.g. distaur Jump rating). It’s essentially a gut-check using knowledge – not a full plot, but enough to say “that route is likely safe/unsafe.”  
- **Micro-Jump Plot** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Plot a very short-range jump (within the same system) in a few minutes. Micro-jumps are less complex, so in 1–6 minutes you can calculate the coordinates to hop, say, from a planet to a gas giant’s orbit. It’s still risky, but sometimes necessary to reposition quickly in-system.  
- **Astrogation Update** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Refine or update a ship’s position and course over about an hour. For example, after a long maneuver, you compare sensor readings to known nav beacons and adjust the ship’s trajectory to stay on course. This ensures that when it’s time to jump, your coordinates are accurate.  
- **Standard Jump Calculation** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Calculate a typical jump route to another star system, taking a few hours. This involves using the ship’s nav computer, consulting star charts, and plotting a safe path through jumpspace. Generally, a jump takes **1D hours** to plot under normal conditions (ships often automate much of this, but the Astrogator must program and verify the solution).  
- **Chart Unfamiliar System** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over 4–24 hours, map a new or poorly-charted star system’s coordinates sufficiently for navigation. You compile data from telescopes and sensors to add this system to the nav charts. This task might be done by scouts after arriving in unexplored space, ensuring future jumps to/from here are possible.  
- **Precompute Multi-Jump** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Spend a couple of days preparing astrogation solutions for a multi-leg journey. For example, plotting three jumps along a trade route in advance (perhaps while in port). Over 10–60 hours, you generate jump data for each leg and cross-check them. This can reduce wait times between jumps later, though you might have to adjust if conditions change.  
- **Map Hyperspace Anomaly** *(INT, 1D days)* – Over several days, study and chart a difficult astrogational challenge, such as a nebula, gravitic anomaly, or ancient misjump zone. You might run probes or gather lots of sensor data to define safe jump vectors around or through the area. At the end, you produce a detailed nav chart of the anomaly’s region, invaluable for future travellers.

## Battle Dress  
*Battle Dress* permits operation of advanced powered armor suits. It includes using the suit’s augmented strength, sensors, and built-in weaponry effectively.

- **Visor Polarization** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Instantly adjust suit visor settings (tint, thermal vision, etc.). In the blink of an eye you react to a flashbang by polarizing the visor or switch to infrared view when the lights go out, using your suit controls almost reflexively.  
- **Power-Assisted Leap** *(STR, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Engage the suit’s servos to make a mighty jump or quick burst of speed. In a few seconds, you can leap onto a second-story roof or charge across a gap that ordinary soldiers couldn’t. The Battle Dress amplifiers make this feasible in about one combat round.  
- **Breach Entry** *(STR, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Use powered armor strength to force open a sealed door or tear through an obstacle in under a minute. For example, ripping a starship airlock door off its hinges or creating an opening in a barricade. What might take minutes of cutting, a suited soldier can do in seconds thanks to servo strength.  
- **Integrated Weapon Calibration** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – In a few minutes, adjust and calibrate the battle dress’s built-in weapons or targeting systems. For instance, zeroing the suit’s laser on a new range or recalibrating the auto-targeting HUD for a different lighting environment. This ensures any shots fired via suit systems are accurate.  
- **Seal Suit Breach** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – If the suit’s integrity is compromised, spend 10–60 minutes to patch it. This could involve spraying sealant foam on a puncture, swapping out a damaged power cell, or recalibrating life support. It’s essentially field maintenance to keep the armor operational outside of a full repair bay.  
- **Sentry Duty (Powered Armor)** *(END, 1D hours)* – Remain on station in battle dress for 1–6 hours, using the suit’s sensors and comms to monitor an area. The skill helps manage suit power consumption and discomfort over long periods. For example, you might perch on a highflaged, observing enemy movements through suit magnification for several hours without losing alertness.  
- **Extended March in Armor** *(END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Travel long distances in battle dress over half a day. While the suit can carry itself, the wearer endures strain from feedback and weight. Over 4–24 hours, you move perhaps dozens of kilometers on foot (or via jumpjets intermittently), arriving with manageable fatigue. Such a forced march in powered armor might be used to infiltrate behind enemy lines without vehicles.  
- **Stealth Infiltration Ops** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Use Battle Dress systems (thermal damping, sound baffles) to conduct a stealth mission spanning a couple of days. You may lie immobile for hours, then move a short way, coordinating sensor data and timing patrol patterns. Over 10–60 hours, you penetrate a secure facility or gather intel, leveraging your suit’s tech for survival and concealment. This is an edge-case use for highly trained special forces in powered armor.  
- **Continuous Combat Deployment** *(END, 1D days)* – Operate in battle dress through a prolonged engagement or wartime deployment lasting several days. This includes managing suit reactor fuel, eating and resting in short snatches (perhaps using auto-doc features of the suit), and staying combat-ready. For 1–6 days, you’re essentially living in the armor. *Battle Dress* skill allows you to avoid incapacitating fatigue or maintenance failures that would sideline a less skilled operator.

## Broker  
*Broker* allows negotiation of trades and arranging fair deals. It’s crucial for merchants setting prices, finding buyers, and managing market transactions.

- **Price Recall** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly recall the standard market price or going rate for a commodity or service. In a single second, a skilled Broker knows, for example, the average price of refined fuel on this world or the usual fare for passage to the next subsector. This helps avoid bad deals instinctively.  
- **Quick Haggle** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Engage in a very brief haggle to shave a price or improve an offer in half a minute or less. For example, in 6–36 seconds of banter at a bazaar stall, you convince the seller to throw in a cheap accessory or knock 5% off the price. It’s the fast talk of trading.  
- **Spot Market Shiftx 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, analyze a snippet of news or a sudden change and deduce its market impact. For instance, hearing that a colony’s crops failed and immediately realizing prices for imported food will spike. This lets you act quickly on opportunities or avoid losses.  
- **Close Small Sale** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to finalize a minor transaction or sale. If you’re peddling goods on a street corner or persuading a traveler to buy your spare part, you spend 1–6 minutes using charm and sales tactics to seal the deal.  
- **Negotiate Contract** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over the course of tens of minutes (up to an hour), negotiate the terms of a contract or trade agreement. This could be booking freight with a client, hashing out a starship charter’s terms, or settling on a price for bulk goods. Both sides discuss and compromise, and your Broker skill ensures you find a fair middle ground (or tilt it to your advantage).  
- **Find a Buyer** *(INT/SOC, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours scouring the local market or networks for a buyer (or seller) for a particular item. For example, you canvas a starport for someone who needs the 100 tons of mining equipment you have, or use comm channels to locate a seller of rare art. After 1–6 hours of asking around (perhaps using Streetwise in a task chain), you come up with a solid lead.  
- **Manage Auction** *(SOC, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, participate in or run an auction or bidding war for a valuable item. You keep track of bids, bluff, and strategically raise bids to either win an item at a good price or sell it at a high price. Broker skill helps read the room of bidders and not go over your limit.  
- **Establish Trade Network** *(INT & SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Spend a couple of days forging a longer-term trading arrangement. This could involve visiting multiple business contacts over 10–60 hours, setting up supply lines or a brokerage network across planets. By the end, you have agreements in place (perhaps letters of credit, schedules for shipments, etc.) that will yield ongoing opportunities.  
- **Broker Major Deal** *(SOC, 1D days)* – Over several days, negotiate a very large or complex deal. This might ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=Minutes%20fortress%2C%20the%20Travellers%20would,will%20make%20their%20Stealth%20checks))f a starship, a planetary mining rights contract, or a multi-million credit cargo exchange. Across 1–6 days of meetings, calls, and document exchange, you handle fluctuating offers, legal chy involving Advocate), and final signatures. A successful Broker here can significantly profit or secure long-term business for the crew.

## Carouse  
*Carouse* is the art of socializing – having fun and helping others enjoy themselves. It covers informal social scenes like parties, bars, and gatherings, including making friends and gathering rumors in such settings.

- **Witty One-Liner** *(SOC, 1D seconds)* – Deliver a quick joke or quip to lighten the mood. In an instant, you might defuse tension with humor or impress someone at the bar with your wit. It’s a great way to break the ice.  
- **Raise a , 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, call attention and lead a toast or cheer. For example, you shout “To the Captain’s birthday!” and get everyone clinking glasses within a half-half minute. This is useful for bonding a group or celebrating a success spontaneously.  
- **Warm Introduction** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute to introduce yourself (or a companion) in a friendly, memorable way. Perhaps you slide into a new group at a club and, within 60 seconds, they’re smiling and welcoming you. Carouse helps you seem likable and interesting off the bat.  
- **Lead a Drinking Song** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Over a few minutes, get a group singing or engaging in a party game. You might start a traditional space shanty or initiate a round of table taps. In 1–6 minutes, the whole tavern is involved, which can boost morale or even provide cover for other activities (like a stealthy teammate slipping away unseen).  
- **Work the Room** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour mingling through a social gathering, ensuring you chat with many individuals briefly. In 10–60 minutes you circulate at a party or starport cantina, picking up gossip and making casual acquaintances. Carouse lets you collect rumors or leads during this time because people open up over drinks and laughter.  
- **Host Gathering** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, act as host or life of a party. You ensure everyone has drinks, introduce people to each other, and keep the mood lively. After 1–6 hours, your gathering is a memorable one – and likely those present feel a camaraderie that might translate into favors or information shared.  
- **Organize Social Event** *(INT/SOC, 1D x 4 hours)* – Take a day to set up a larger social function, like a shipboard celebration, a local festival event, or a formal dinner. In 4–24 hours you arrange the venue, entertainment, food, and invitations. Your skill ensures the event appeals to the guests. When it kicks off, you’ll likely use more Carouse to keep it running smoothly.  
- **Pub Crawl Marathon** *(END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a day or two (10–60 hours), hit numerous social spots and maintain the fun. This could represent going out at dusk and partying through the night and next day across multiple establishments. *Carouse* helps you hold your liquor and energy (with END for stamina) so that you bond with comrades or locals without collapsing.  
- **Build Local Network** *(SOC, 1D days)* – By carousing night after night for several days, you become a known friendly face in the community. Over 1–6 days of frequenting pubs, clubs, and gatherings, you befriend key locals, learn who’s who, and ingratiate yourself into the social fabric. This can grant long-term allies or at least a reliable flow of street rumors (often overlapping with *Streetwise* intel, but via friendship rather than shady dealing).

## Comms (Communications)  
*Comms* covers the use of modern telecommunications: opening channels, operating comm equipment, jamming signals, and following protocols for communication with ships or ports. Essentially, it’s the skill for anything involving sending or receiving signals over distance.

- **Open Channel** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Establish a communications channel or “hail” another station/ship in a matter of seconds. With a quick command on the console, you find a clear frequency and begin transmitting. This is used to call for help or answer incoming hails swiftly, ensuring minimal delay in getting a message through.  
- **Broadcast Distress Code** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In an emergency, trigger or send a pre-arranged distress signal in under half a minute. This could be pressing the panic button that sends a mayday, or quickly encoding a short SOS message. The Comms skill helps you remember the right frequency and code format instantly.  
- **Initiate Signal Lock** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend up to a minute to lock onto a specific signal or frequency. For example, homing in on a weak rescue beacon ing with a secure channel. With Comms skill, you fine-tune dials or software filters to isolate the desired signal out of static.  
- **Short-Range Transmission** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – In a few minutes, set up and send a localized communication. This might involve configuring a tight-beam laser comm to a nearby ship or aligning a directional radio at an orbital relay. *Comms* ensures the message is clear and properly aimed, whether it’s voice, text, or data.  
- **Jamming Burst** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – For 10–60 minutes, employ communications jamming on enemy or unauthorized signals. Using Comms know-how, you pick the optimal frequencies and protocols to disrupt (perhaps making an **Electronics (comms)** opposed check if target tries to resist). This timeframe might represent jamming during a combat encounter or battle, preventing foes from calling reinforcements.  
- **Decrypt Message** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour decoding an intercepted transmission. With the right equipment, you apply cipher-breaking techniques to read a routine encrypted message. (Truly high-level encryption might take longer or require *Computers*, but many codes yield to a skilled comms officer in this time.)  
- **Long-Range Uplink** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Take a few hours to establish a stable long-distance comm link. For instance, aligning a ship’s dish to communicate with a star system’s relay network or jury-rigging a makeshift antenna to reach orbit from a planet. Over 1–6 hours you adjust hardware and software for sustained communication over light-hours of distance (accounting for lag).  
- **Sustained Jamming** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Maintain a broad-spectrum jamming or comms blackout for 4–24 hours. This extended action might be part of covert operations (keeping an area dark while an infiltration occurs). You’ll need to monitor and tweak the jamming signal to respond to enemy attempts to circumvent it, using Comms skill throughout the period.  
- **Install Comms Network** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, set up a communications network or system. For example, placing and calibrating communication relays around a base or configuring a starport’s traffic control comm system. In 10–60 hours you lay out hardware, ensure coverage, and test the system. By the end, a previously disconnected area is fully linked (perhaps improving connectivity or enabling planet-wide broadcasts).  

## Computers  
*Computers* covers the use and control of computer systems. This includes operating software, hacking systems, programming, and handling digital security. (Note: in some editions, Computers might be a specialty of Electronics, but in this guide we treat it as its own skill per the latest rules.)

- **Quick Database Query** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly retrieve a simple piece of information via a computer. In a second or two, you execute a pre-saved query or command (or use a voice interface) to pull up, say, a crew roster or the current ship time. This represents knowing exactly where to click or what to type for a quick answer.  
- **Bypass Login** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, bypass a basic computer login or security screen. Perhaps you use an admin override code that you remembered or exploit a still-active session on a terminal. This isn’t full hacking, just quick thinking and maybe a bit of luck to get initial access.  
- **Locate File** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Navigate a computer’s file system to find a specific document or piece of data in under a minute. With skill, you efficiently use search functions or intuitive directory guessing to dig up that cargo manifest or security footage file without trawling for hours.  
- **Write Script/Macro** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes coding a small script to automate a task or parse data. For instance, you might whip up a program to sift sensor logs for anomalies, or a macro that auto-formats reports. In 1–6 minutes you can create or modify a short piece of code, saving time on repetitive work.  
- **Hack Access** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over the course of tens of minutes (perhaps up to an hour), penetrate a secure system or account. This could involve guessing passwords, exploiting known software vulnerabilities, or using hacking tools. **Computers** skill will determine success (possibly opposed by system security); the timeframe of 10–60 minutes is typical for getting into a moderately secure system if things go well.  
- **Analyze Data Logs** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours analyzing large datasets or system logs. For example, you might review hours of ship sensor readings, financial transaction records, or communications logs to find a pattern or specific event. Computes filter the noise and pinpoint what you’re looking for using queries and data analysis techniques.  
- **Software Patch or Repair** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, debug a software issue or patch a computer system. This might be fixing a troublesome bug in the ship’s library program or restoring corrupted data from backups. In 4–24 hours, you systematically test and resolve the issues, ensuring the system runs smoothly again.  
- **Write/Modify Program** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Develop a new program or significantly modify existing software over a couple of days (10–60 hours). This covers creating custom software, such as a malware to infiltrate a network, a new sensor algorithm to improve resolution, or even an expert system to aid in language translation. It’s an advanced task that yields a tangible software tool, given sufficient time and skill.  
- **Overhaul Operating System** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Across several days, perform a major overhaul of a complex computer system. For example, rewriting a starship’s navigation computer OS to remove antiquated limitations, or rebuilding the network architecture of a colony’s data center. This is often done during downtime – you might have the ship in dock for 1–6 days while you upgrade and test the systems. On completion, the system is vastly improved or personalized, potentially granting future bonuses for those specific computers.

## Deception  
*Deception* enables lying, disguise, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery. It’s the skill for con artists, spies, and anyone trying to fool others or hide the truth.

- **Palming a Coin** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In an eye-blink, perform a sleight of hand to conceal a small object. Whether it’s palming a coin, a data chip, or a keycard, a skilled deceiver can make it “disappear” from sight in a second or two. This also covers quickly swapping similar objects (the classic shell game move).  
- **Maintain Poker Face** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Keep your expression perfectly neutral or misleading for a brief but critical moment (up to ~30 seconds). For instance, when dealt a great hand in cards, you betray no reaction, or you receive alarming news but show no sign to onlookers. Those few moments of false calm can be vital to not tipping your hand.  
- **Fake Out (Feint)** *(SOC/DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Execute a quick deceptive action lasting under a minute. In combat, this could be a feint: you move as if going one way but go another, throwing off an opponent’s defense. Socially, it might be faking a stumble or distraction to draw someone’s eyes away while an accomplice acts. It’s a short con that relies on others reacting to the immediate false signal.  
- **Improvise Cover Story** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Think on your feet to come up with a plausible story or excuse within ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=1D%20Combat%20Combat%20round%20Hurrying,will%20affect%20the%20Broker%20check)) ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=Minutes%20fortress%2C%20the%20Travellers%20would,will%20make%20their%20Stealth%20checks))atch you somewhere off-limits; you spend 1–6 minutes of conversation weaving a lie about how you got lost looking for the bathroom and complimenting their security to mollify them. *Deception* helps ensure your story is coherent and fits known facts.  
- **Apply Disguise** *(DEX, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Use makeup, clothing, and props to change your appearance over 10–60 minutes. You might impersonate a specific individual (if you have reference) or just alter your look (older, different ethnic appearance, etc.). With a disguise kit, a skilled deceiver can fool casual inspection for a while. (Opposed checks with Recon or Investigate might apply if someone is suspicious.)  
- **Con a Mark** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, play out a con game on a target. This could be posing as a friendly local to gain a traveler’s trust and then swindle them, or ingratiating yourself with someone by false pretenses to access their valuables. You maintain the deception through multiple interactions (maybe over an afternoon or evening), setting them up for the “sting.”  
- **Forge Documents** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Create fake documents or credentials over the course of a day. This might include falsifying an ID card, altering a ship’s registration papers, or crafting a fake set of orders. In 4–24 hours you gather needed templates, use graphic design or physical craft to mimic official markings, and produce a passable forgery. How good it is may depend on your Effect and tools, but to a layman or low-level security it should hold up.  
- **Deep Cover Impersonation** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Prepare for and execute an extended impersonation or infiltration lasting a couple of days. You research your role (studying the mannerisms and background of the person or type of person you’re imitating) for perhaps 10–60 hours. Then you enter the scenario – for example, posing as the new staff member at a crime lord’s mansion – and maintain the act. *Deception* here is used both in preparation and moment-to-moment as you ad-lib in the role.  
- **The Long Con** *(SOC, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days (or more), orchestrate an elaborate deception involving multiple steps and possibly multiple people. This could be setting up a fake business to lure investors, complete with an office anng as employees, or slowly gaining a noble’s confidence under a false identity to access their vault. The *Deception* skill is employed in planning each detail and executing them without tipping off the target. By the end of the period, if successful, the mark is thoroughly duped and the payoff is at hand.

## Diplomat  
*Diplomat* is used for formal negotiations, establishing peaceful contact, and smoothing over faux pas in high society or official contexts. It differs from Persuade in its typically formal or high-stakes setting (embassies, high society, inter-species talks).

- **Protocol Reminder** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly recall or perform a specific point of etiquette or protocol. In a second or two, you bow the correct depth for a noble, use the proper honorific in conversation, or remember not to shake the hand of the Zhodani envoy (telepaths dislike it, for example). This quick action can avert offense in diplomatic situations.  
- **Smooth Apology** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Deliver a quick, face-saving apology or compliment to defuse a minor social mistake within a few moments. For instance, if a companion misspeaks at a formal dinner, you immediately interject a gracious apology or humorous self-deprecation that calms the dignitaries. It takes under half a minute to turn the tides of embarrassment.  
- **Mediation Interrupt** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Step into a tense exchange for under a minute to prevent it from escalating. For example, two traders at a negotiation table start shouting; you raise your hands and speak calmly but firmly, cooling them down just enough so talks can continue. In 10–60 seconds of intervention, you’ve prevented a walk-out or a fight.  
- **Formal Introduction** *(SOC/INT, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to introduce and set a positive tone between parties who are meeting. You might present your crew to a planetary council, or introduce two previously hostile leaders by highlighting common ground. In 1–6 minutes, you use proper titles and respectful language. Your Diplomat skill ensures everyone feels respected and willing to talk after the intro.  
- **Diplomatic Debrief** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – After a misunderstanding or incident, spend up to an hour smoothing ruffled feathers. You might visit an offended official and, over tea (10–60 minutes), explain the cultural misunderstanding that led to the slight and express sincere regret. This action can remove negative modifiers in future dealings by formally addressing grievances.  
- **Negotiate Ceasefire** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Over several hours of discussion, broker a temporary truce between conflicting parties. You shuttle between sides or gather them at the table, outline terms (e.g. each side will halt aggression for 48 hours and withdraw to agreed positions), and use your authority or charm to get buy-in. After 1–6 hours, ideally, you have an agreement in principle that stops the immediate violence.  
- **Draft Treaty Outline** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – In a full day of work (4–24 hours), write up the framework of a formal agreement or treaty. This could be a trade agreement between two governments or a peace treaty after a small war. You’ll incorporate points from all sides, ensure the language is acceptable diplomatically, and prepare a document that higher-ups will refine and sign. Diplomat skill helps phrase commitments ambiguously (when needed) and include face-saving concessions.  
- **Summit Mediation** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days of meetings (10–60 hours total, possibly with breaks), mediate a high-level summit or multi-party negotiation. You guide discussions, keep everyone following protocol, create small-group breakout sessions to resolve specific issues, and perhaps use task chain rolls (with Persuade or Advocate from advisors) to assist. By the end, you aim to have all parties reach a consensus or at least a signed communique.  
- **Establish Diplomatic Ties** *(SOC, 1D days)* – Spend 1–6 days in intensive diplomatic activity to open formal relations with a new group or world. This could involve ceremonial exchanges, dinners, and multiple meetings. For example, as envoy to a newly contacted alien race or a lost colony, you invest several days building trust, learning their customs (with help of *Science (Social)* maybe), and negotiating the basics of an alliance or trade pact. Success means ongoing peaceful contact is secured as you depart.

## Drive  
*Drive* is used for controlling ground vehicles of all types. Specialties include Hovercraft, Mole (drilling vehicles), Tracked, Walker, and Wheeled, but all fall under this general skill for piloting land vehicles.

- **Evasive Maneuver** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Make a split-second steering maneuver to avoid an obstaclIn a single second or two, you jerk the wheel or controls – swerving around a pedestrian or debris on the road, or ducking the vehicle as a projectile flies by. This quick reaction can turn a potential crash into a near-miss.  
- **Tight Turn** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Navigate a sharp turn or series of rapid maneuvers over a few combat rounds (up to ~30 seconds). For example, weaving through traffic cones or zigzagging to shake a tailing vehicle in an alley. *Drive* skill keeps control as G-forces or tricky traction threaten to spin you out.  
- **Rough Terrain Burst** *(DEX or INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, get a vehicle through a small patch of hazardous terrain. Perhaps you gun a wheeled ATV over a series of potholes or use quick thinking to hop a hovercraft over a short chasm. It’s an intense few moments of driving skill preventing a stall or crash.  
- **Short Chase/Evasion** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Engage in a brief vehicle chase or escape lasting a few minutes. This might be a high-speed pursuit through city streets or a cat-and-mouse game in a spaceport cargo yard. Over 1–6 minutes, you use driving tactics (sharp turns, sudden stops, using cover) to either catch up or break away. After this, either you’ve succeeded or the situation might escalate into a longer chase.  
- **Commute or Patrol** *(END, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Drive to a nearby location within 10–60 minutes without incident, or conduct a routine patrol drive around a perimeter. While not dramatic, this covers the everyday use of Drive: obeying traffic (or not, if you’re in a hurry but skilled), avoiding minor hazards, and getting from A to B reliably. A driver with skill might take shortcuts or time lights to arrive a bit faster safely.  
- **Long-Distance Drive** *(END, 1D hours)* – Travel overland for several hours (1–6 hours) in a vehicle. This covers a road trip between cities or a trek across a desert in a rover. The Drive skill helps manage fatigue, vehicle wear, and navigation at speed. You might also handle minor incidents en route (a tire puncture, finding fuel) efficiently.  
- **Off-Road Expedition** *(INT/END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a full day (up to 24 hours, possibly with breaks) driving through difficult terrain. This includes pathfinding for your vehicle type: for a wheeled truck it might be mud and rocks, for a mole machine it’s dense substrate navigation, for a walker it could be steep hills. You plan your route, possibly scout ahead on foot occasionally, and carefully take the vehicle through. *Drive (appropriate specialty)* is crucial to avoid getting hopelessly stuck or damaged during such a lengthy off-road journey.  
- **Cross-Country Journey** *(END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Drive nearly continuously over 2–3 days (10–60 hours total). You and perhaps co-drivers rotate, but Drive skill lets you remain effective behind the wheel far longer than a novice. This could be rushing medical supplies to a distant colony, where you only stop briefly for refueling and rest. By the end, you’ve covered vast distance at the best speed safely possible.  
- **Endurance Rally** *(END, 1D days)* – Participate in a multi-day vehicle endurance event or manage vehicle operations for a week under harsh conditions. For example, a 1–6 day tank convoy through enemy territory where maintenance stops are short and nightly driving is required to avoid ambush. A skilled driver uses mechanical sympathy to minimize breakdowns and ensures full focus whenever at the controls, despite minimal sleep. Narratively, this could be used to ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=1D%20Hours%20One%20hour%20technical,wilderness))the group’s vehicle makes it through a long scenario intact or if someone falls asleep at the wheel or blows an engine.

## Engineer  
*Engineer* is used to operate and maintain starship and advanced vehicle systems. Specialties include M-Drive (maneuver drive), J-Drive (jump drive), Power plant, Life Support, and Electronics (ship systems). It’s the go-to skill for keeping technology running beyond basic repairs.

- **Emergency Shutdown** *(DEX or INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly trigger a safety shutdown or hit a kill switch to prevent catastrophic failure. In one second you might slam a big red button to shut down a reactor that’s overloading or cut power to a shorting system. This prevents further damage or explosion by acting faster than automated safeties.  
- **Reroute Power** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Over a few seconds, manipulate a ship’s power distribution to deal with a crisis. For example, you isolate a damaged circuit and shunt power around it, or divert extra power to shields. This is often done during combat or emergencies. It was cited as an example of a **1D×10 seconds** task in the core rules, meaning quick rerouting might take on the order of **ten seconds** – with exceptional skill, perhaps closer to 6 seconds. In either case, it’s a very rapid engineering fix.  
- **Bypass Damaged Circuit** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, jury-rig a bypass for a broken component. Imagine a console’s wiring is fried by a surge; you pull out a multitool, strip two wires and twist them together or plug in a portable power unit to replace the connection. After 10–60 seconds of sparks and fumbling, the system flickers back to life with your temporary fix.  
- **Patch Hull/Suit Breach** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to apply a patch kit to a compromised hull section or vacc suit tear. You might clamp a plate over a small hull rupture or use sealant to stop an air leak in engineering. In 1–6 minutes, you stabilize the situation. (This often goes hand-in-hand with *Vacc Suit* skill for personal armor, er knows the structural side of things too.)  
- **Calibrate Drive Systems** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour tweaking a ship’s engines or systems for optimal performance. For example, after installing a replacement maneuver drive part, you run tests and adjust the plasma flow regulators. This ensures the ship handles smoothly. *Engineer (M-Drive)* or relevant specialty would reduce any penalties for using the system immediately after heavy damage or changes.  
- **Repair Malfunction** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Take a few hours to fix a significant system failure. Perhaps the jump drive misfired and blew out a coupling; you replace the part, run diagnostics, and bring the drive back online. In 1–6 hours, a skilled Engineer can fix most standard failures if they have spare parts. Complex problems might also involve *Mechanic* or *Electronics*, but *Engineer* covers starship-scale issues specifically.  
- **Life Support Overhaul** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a day servicing life support or another subsystem thoroughly. Over 4–24 hours, you might regenerate spent scrubber filters, lubricate air circulators, and recalibrate temperature controls throughout the ship. After this, the crew will breathe easy – literally – and the chances of an environmental glitch drop considerably.  
- **System Upgrade** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days, install and integrate a major upgrade to a ship system. For example, swapping in a higher-capacity power plant module or refitting the jump drive with improved coils. You’ll physically install hardware (perhaps with help of robots or a yard crew) and then run test jumps or maneuvers. In 10–60 hours, the upgrade is complete, but careful Engineering skill use ensures it meshes with existing systems without new problems.  
- **Complete Refit** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days of dedicated work (often with a team in a shipyard), perform a full refit or heavy repair on a starship. This could include pulling the drive core, repairing battle damage to multiple decks, and reassembling everything. The Engineer skill guides the sequence of operations, testing each system after repair and coordinating technicians. This is the sort of task done during extended downtime or when the ship is in dock after an incident. A successful refit brings the vessel back to 100% functionality.

## Explosives  
*Explosives* covers setting and disarming demolition charges and bombs. It includes knowledge of various explosive types, detonators, and safety procedures for both blowing things up and preventing explosions.

- **Spot Explosive Device** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – With a moment’s glance, recognize the presence of an explosive or booby trap. In a single second, you might notice a grenade with its pin pulled (about to go off) or identify a suspicious package as a bomb. This quick perception comes from knowing what explosives and their triggers look like – an essential safety skill.  
- **Light/Arm Fuse** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, arm a simple explosive device. For instance, you light the fuse on dynamite, pull the pin on a grenade and set it in place, or press the buttons to arm a pre-planted charge. You do it efficiently so you have time to get clear. Similarly, this covers tossing a grenade and taking cover in one smooth action (though throwing accuracy is another skill).  
- **Stabilize Unstable Charge** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to secure or stabilize an explosive that is in danger of detonating. Perhaps an IED’s timer is erratic or a plastic explosive is sweating (a sign of instability); you quickly adjust wires or add a makeshift support to prevent an immediate blast. This can buy time for a full disarm.  
- **Rig Simple Demolition** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes placing a small charge to achieve a desired effect. For example, setting a charge to blow a door open (breaching) or fell a tree to block a path. You calculate placement and the amount of explosives needed so the result is effective but controlled. In 1–6 minutes you can prep and set such a charge with detonator.  
- **Defuse Bomb** *(DEX/EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Carefully disarm an explosive device over the course of tens of minutes (up to an hour). You might be clipping wires on a complex bomb, hacking a digital timer, or removing the detonator from a mine. *Explosives* skill lets you interpret the bomb-maker’s method (is there a trap wire? a decoy circuit?) and choose the correct approach. After 10–60 minutes of sweat and steady hands, the device is rendered safe.  
- **Controlled Demolition** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Take a few hours to set up a controlled demolition of a structure or large object. For example, planting multiple charges in a building so it collapses inward, or blowing a derelict starship into manageable scrap sections. Over 1–6 hours you calculate stress points, place explosives at key structural members, wire them in sequence, and evacuate the area. Assuming average difficulty, the building comes down exactly as planned, which might require an Explosives check to ensure timing and placement were correct.  
- **Minefield CleariD x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, systematically clear an area of mines or unexploded ordnance. You proceed carefully, using detectors and probes. *Explosives* skill helps you identify likely spots and safely disarm or remove each mine. In 4–24 hours, you could clear a large field or road. This is dangerous work and any mistakes could be deadly, but with time and skill the area becomes safe.  
- **Manufacture Explosives** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days, create explosive materials or devices from raw components. Perhaps you have fertilizer, fuel, and some electronics on hand – you craft homemade bombs or blasting charges. Or in a lab with chemical supplies, you synthesize batches of plastique or gunpowder. 10–60 hours of work yields a supply of explosives; the quality and stability will depend on skill and resources (a good roll yields stable, potent charges; a failure could be dangerously unstable product).  
- **Demolition Project** *(INT, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days, plan and execute a large-scale demolition requiring significant expertise. This could be bringing down a skyscraper in a crowded city with minimal collateral damage, or tunneling with explosives through a mountain for a new passage. You coordinate multiple charges over multiple days, perhaps with a team. The *Explosives* skill ensures calculations are correct and all safety protocols followed. At the end, the target is demolished and the goal achieved (new tunnel open, etc.), with any side effects (like seismic impact) kept to acceptable bounds.

## Flyer  
*Flyer* covers piloting atmospheric and grav vehicles. Specialties include Airship, Grav (gravitic craft like air/rafts), Rotor (helicopters and hovercraft), and Wing (airplanes). All involve operating vehicles in atmosphere (and sometimes near-ground).

- **Correct for Turbulence** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Instantly adjust controls to counter a sudden gust or turbulence bump. In a second or two, you stabilize a small aircraft that got caught by a wind shear or keep an air/raft steady as a nearby explosion’s shockwave hits. This prevents loss of control or passenger injury in the very short term.  
- **Aerial Dodge** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Perform an evasive maneuver in an aircraft over a few seconds. For example, in 6–36 seconds, you roll a shuttle to avoid debris, or zigzag a grav bike to throw off an enemy’s aim. In a dogfight, this could be a barrel roll or sudden dive. *Flyer* skill keeps you from stalling or crashing during the aggressive move.  
- **Emergency Descent/Climb** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, execute a rapid altitude change safely. Perhaps air traffic control warns of a collision; you dive your winged craft sharply then level out, all within 60 seconds. Or a missile locks on and you climb at maximum thrust. The challenge is to do it without engine strain or structural damage – training in Flyer helps gauge the limits.  
- **Standard Takeoff/Landing** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to launch or land a vehicle properly. A small shuttle launch or a grav vehicle liftoff might only take 1–6 minutes of prep and execution: checking systems, clearing for takeoff, and smoothly accelerating. Landing an airship or rotorcraft similarly is done patiently to avoid a hard touchdown. While even unskilled individuals might manage basic takeoffs in simple craft, *Flyer* ensures it’s done by the ing wear and tear and hazards.  
- **Recon Flight** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Fly a patrol or scouting pattern over 10–60 minutes. You pilot an aircraft (perhaps a grav drone or a rotorcraft) in systematic sweeps over an area, keeping it steady for sensor use or visual scanning. Flyer skill helps maintain optimal altitude and speed for observation. After the flight, you’ll have covered a wide area – hopefully spotting any points of interest.  
- **Medium Haul Flight** *(END, 1D hours)* – Pilot an aircraft for a continuous 1–6 hour journey. This could be a passenger grav shuttle ferrying people between cities, or a cargo plane moving goods regionally. Over the trip, you handle navigation, maybe some weather avoidance, and routine communication with air traffic control. Flyer skill helps deal with any mid-flight issues (engine sputter, mild storms) calmly.  
- **Overnight Flight Watch** *(END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Operate an aircraft through the night or for an extended 24-hour period with minimal rest. If you’re the pilot of an airship or long-range aircraft, you might have autopilot, but *Flyer* skill keeps you alert for 4–24 hours in case of anomalies. You might take short naps and then correct course as needed. This is taxing (hence END), but a skilled pilot can manage a solo long flight that normally would need two pilots.  
- **Aerial Survey Mission** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days (10–60 hours total, not all in one go), conduct a thorough aerial survey or mapping project. You fly a grid pattern over a huge swath of land or sea, coordinating sensors/cameras to map terrain, find mineral deposits, or search for a lost ship. Flyer skill ensures you hit all the waypoints precisely and aft gently to get clear sensor readings.  
- **Multi-Day Air Voyage** *(END, 1D days)* – Pilot an airship or other slow long-range craft on a voyage lasting days. For example, guiding a dirigible across a continent might take 1–6 days of travel. During this time, you’ll face changes in weather, need to maintain engines in flight (perhaps coordinating with *Engineer* skill crew), and manage crew rest. Flyer skill combined with endurance sees you through the multi-day journey safely to the destination.

## Gambler  
*Gambler* means familiarity with a wide variety of gambling games (cards, roulette, sports betting, etc.) and a strong grasp of probability. It helps in assessing odds and reading opponents in games of chance.

- **Recognize Cheating Tell** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – In a heartbeat, notice if someone is cheating or a game is rigged. Perhaps you spot a marked card or a loaded die as it’s cast. Within 1–6 seconds of observing the play, your probabilistic intuition and eye for detail raise a red flag that “something’s off.”  
- **Calculate Odds** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Take a few seconds to mentally compute the odds of a simple event. For example, as the last card is about to be revealed in poker, you quickly estimate the probability it’s the one your opponent needs. In 6–36 seconds, you run through likely outcomes and adjust your betting strategy accordingly (or decide whether to accept a risky proposition outside of formal games).  
- **Read Opponent’s Confidence** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute of play, gauge another gambler’s confidence or bluff. Are they betting high because they have a great hand or because they’re faking? Through subtle social reads and pattern analysis, you get a hunch about their strategy. This could be an opposed check vs. their Deception if they’re skilled.  
- **Play a Hand** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Engage in a single round or hand of a game (like one hand of poker, or one spin of roulette and placing bets) taking a few minutes. Gambler skill lets you recall card counting techniques, probability of draws, and bet appropriately. You might not win every hand (luck is still a factor), but you maximize your expected value and minimize tells during that short play.  
- **Short Game Session** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Play a quick series of games or betting rounds over the course of up to an hour. This could be a few rounds of betting on a gladiator match or several quick hands of blackjack. During this session, you adjust your strategy based on wins/losses (perhaps employing a betting system) and maybe come out ahead more often than not. It’s long enough for skill to matter, but short enough that big swings of luck can still occur.  
- **Tournament Phase** *(SOC/INT, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours in sustained competitive play, such as the final table of a poker tournament or an extended evening at a high-stakes mahjong table. Over 1–6 hours, your Gambler skill helps you manage your bankroll, observe opponents’ habits, and remain unpredictable. Stamina matters – keeping a clear head as others get tired or emotional. By the end, if fortune permits, you might be the one with most chips.  
- **Analyze Betting System** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, analyze a complex betting scenario or system outside of a single game. For example, you examine the statistics of a season of grav-ball to devise a betting strategy for the playoffs, or you study the patterns of a casino’s slot machines to find one that’s likely to pay out. After 4–24 hours of calculations, simulations, and maybe small test bets, you come up with a plan to tilt odds slightly in your favor (as much as possible without outright cheating).  
- **Run a Gambling Scheme** *(INT/SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days, orchestrate a scheme to profit from gambling. Perhaps you organize a high-stakes game on your ship during jump, subtly ensuring the odds favor you (not cheating exactly, but choosing games you excel at and opponents who are overconfident). Or you coordinate with a partner – one plays and the other signals from the crowd. Over 10–60 hours (maybe a long convention weekend), you execute this plan, hoping to rake in credits. Gambler skill ensures you pick the right games and stakes, and manage the scheme without tipping off victims or authorities.  
- **Marathon Gambling Binge** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – Engage in continuous gambling over multiple days. Classic example: “Casino lock-in” – you gamble for 1–6 days with minimal sleep, riding waves of luck. Gambler skill combined with sheer endurance helps you avoid making stupid mistakes due to fatigue. You track long-term patterns: maybe noticing that over 300 roulette spins, a bias in the wheel emerges, or that a rival at the poker table plays worse after 48 hours awake. By the end, you either walk away significantly up… or have pressed your luck too far. The skill won’t guarantee a win against negative odds, but it can prolong your run and maybe tell you the optimal point to quit while ahead.

## Gunner  
*Gunner* covers operation of ship-mounted weapons in space combat. Specialties include Turrets, Ortillery (orbital bombardment), Screens (defensive energy screens), and Capital Weapons. It’s used when firing or managing these systems rather than personal arms.

- **Target Snapshot** *(DEX/INT, 1D seconds)* – In a moment, acquire a target using a ship’s weapon sights or sensor feed. This quick action might be needed when a new bogey appears suddenly. In 1–6 seconds, you slew the turret towards the target and get a firing solution *just* enough for a hasty shot. (Actual firing would be another action—this is the quick targeting lock-on that a skilled Gunner can perform faster than normal.)  
- **Turret Firing Burst** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Fire a turret-mounted weapon for a single engagement round (a matter of seconds). In space combat, this could be one or two sa ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=1D%20x%2010%20Ten%20seconds,begin%20with%20a%20Recon%20check)) ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=Minutes%20fortress%2C%20the%20Travellers%20would,will%20make%20their%20Stealth%20checks))gun burst. On a vehicle, it might be a heavy machine gun burst at ground targets. The Gunner skill ensures those shots are on target. Within ~30 secon ([MgT 2E - Core Rulebook - Flip eBook Pages 51-100 | AnyFlip](https://anyflip.com/dtebm/okmn/basic/51-100#:~:text=1D%20Hours%20One%20hour%20technical,wilderness))eashed and potentially hit the enemy. *(In Traveller space combat, time units are typically longer per round, but for cinematic purposes this covers a short exchange.)*  
- **Charge and Fire Heavy Weapon** *(DEX/EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Handle the spin-up or charge cycle of a bigger weapon and fire it within a minute. For example, a starship’s particle beam bay might require 30 seconds to charge capacitors. A skilled Gunner monitors this and times the shot perfectly as soon as ready. Similarly, lining up an ortillery strike might take some tens of seconds before you push the “fire” button at exactly the right window for orbital mechanics.  
- **Reload Ordinance** *(STR, 1D minutes)* – Replace or reload ammunition for a ship’s weapon in a few minutes. On a turret you might swap out a missile rack or slot in fresh powercells for a plasma barbette. This normally is done by crew or auto-loaders, but if you’re alone or short-handed, Gunner skill helps you do it manually in 1–6 minutes. Physical strength helps when lifting heavy shells or hoses. After this, the weapon is ready to fire again.  
- **Calibrate Targeting** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over ten to sixty minutes, fine-tune the targeting systems of a ship’s weapons. You might run test firings, adjust for barrel wear, or align the sensor inputs (like linking a new sensor array to the turret fire-control). Gunner skill with education ensures you understand the system specs. The result is improved accuracy or reliability in the next combat – essentially eliminating any minor targeting penalty that could have arisen from miscalibration.  
- **Gunnery Drill** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours drilling or simulating with the weapon crew. In 1–6 hours, you run mock engagement scenarios for turret gunners or practice coordinating a salvo from multiple guns. This hones timing and teamwork. Within the game, such practice could grant a small situational bonus or reduce the chance of mishaps in the next real engagement, as everyone has rehearsed what to do.  
- **Repair/Modify Weapon System** *(EDU/DEX, 1D x 4 hours)* – Work on a ship’s weapon over a day to fix or enhance it. For example, replacing a fried laser lens or installing a custom targeting software patch. *Engineer* or *Mechanic* might overlap here, but a *Gunner* knows the user’s perspective and fine points of the weapon’s operation. In 4–24 hours, the turret or bay is repaired or tweaked. You might cite this if, say, the turret was hit in a previous battle – you bring it back online by next morning.  
- **Orbital Bombardment Coordination** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days (10–60 hours), plan and execute a systematic orbital strike or fire support mission. This involves calculating trajectories for *ortillery* strikes, timing shots with ground observers or sensor data, and possibly coordinating multiple gunners or platforms. The Gunner skill here is used for the planning and then making the actual shots over the campaign of bombardment. By the end, you’ve hit all designated targets (or kept an area suppressed) with minimal wasted shots.  
- **Prolonged Siege Gunnery** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – Serve as gunner in an extended engagement lasting days, such as a blockade or siege in space. For 1–6 days, you remain at your post, periodically firing at any targets of opportunity or repelling attempted breakouts. You must manage coolant, power, and your own fatigue. Gunner skill, plus endurance, allows you to keep weapons ready at all times and react quickly even on day 5 of dull, repetitive scanning. This is narrative-heavy; for example, a GM might roll once per day for the blockade runner attempt and your gunnery decides if they slip through or get hit.

## Gun Combat  
*Gun Combat* covers the use of personal ranged weapons like pistols, rifles, and energy guns. Specialties are Slug Pistols, Slug Rifles, Shotguns, Energy Pistols, Energy Rifles, etc., but generally any handheld firearm use falls here. 

- **Quick Draw & Fire** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In one smooth motion, draw a sidearm and fire off a shot. Within a single second or two, a skilled shooter can have their weapon out of its holster and a round downrange – potentially catching an opponent by surprise. (This often ties into initiative in combat; a high *Gun Combat* skill might justify a quickdraw action.)  
- **Controlled Burst** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Fire a short burst or a few aimed shots over a round (~6 seconds). You might squeeze off three rounds from an auto pistol or take two quick shots with your laser rifle while bracing. Gun Combat skill allows you to manage recoil and keep those shots on target. In typical combat turns, this is essentially your attack action, but the skill ensures efficiency – e.g. you hit multiple targets or concentrate hits where you want them.  
- **Tactical Reload** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Reload your firearm under pressure in under a minute. In 10–60 seconds you can swap magazines, cycle a new power cell into a laser pistol, or even partially reload a revolver or shotgun shell-by-shell if you don’t have speedloaders. Skilled shooters do this faster and without fumbling. If 10 seconds (a round or two) is still too long in a firefight, you might instead use a smaller timeframe with a difficulty increase; however, outside of immediate danger, a reload taking under a minute is reasonable.  
- **Aim and Shoot** *(INT or DEX, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes setting up a very accurate shot. This is sniping or target shooting: you find a stable position, control your breathing, line up sights or scope, perhaps account for wind. After 1–6 minutes of preparation, you take the shot. Mechanically, this would grant significant bonuses (per aim rules), and with *Gun Combat* skill, you maximize the benefit of that careful aim – potentially hitting extremely difficult targets at long range with the first shot.  
- **Field Strip Weapon** *(EDU/DEX, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over the course of up to an hour, disassemble, clean, and reassemble a firearm. This is routine maintenance that any soldier does. In game terms, doing this after a battle prevents malfunctions. *Gun Combat* skill means you know your weapon’s ins and outs: in 10–60 minutes you can fix minor issues (like a clogged barrel), replace worn springs, or jury-rig a small modification (like adjusting a laser sight).  
- **Target Practice** *(DEX, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours practicing at a range or in a safe area. Firing at targets for 1–6 hours improves muscle memory and calibration. While this may not have an immediate quantifiable effect, the narrative result is keeping your skills sharp. A referee might allow a very small experience gain or simply note that your character is diligent. You could also use this time to familiarize yourself with an unfamiliar weapon model (negating a minor penalty next time you use that specific gun, perhaps).  
- **Hunting Trip** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half or full day, use your gun combat skills in a hunting context. You track game (using Recon/Survival for tracking but Gun Combat for the shooting part) and take down a target or two. This is a way to gather food in the wilderness or just a recreational activity. It tests patience and marksmanship over 4–24 hours. A skilled shooter can humanely drop an animal with a single well-placed shot, even at a good distance.  
- **Train Recruits (Firearms)** *(SOC/DEX, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a few days (10–60 hours total, perhaps 2–3 days of training sessions), teach less skilled people how to shoot. You demonstrate stance, trigger control, maintenance, etc., and supervise their practice. Using your *Gun Combat* skill and social ability, you correct their mistakes. By the end, the trainees might effectively have Gun Combat 0 (basic competence) or at least lose their worst habits. This is a downtime activity a military character might do when not adventuring.  
- **Extended Engagement** *(END, 1D days)* – Participate in a prolonged firefight or series of skirmishes spanning multiple days. Perhaps you’re involved in urban warfare that lasts for 1–6 days, with several firefights each day. Gun Combat skill here represents keeping your weapons functional (cleaning them each night), rationing ammo, and retaining accuracy despite fatigue. By the end of such a campaign, an expert gunner might have made numerous critical shots. (Mechanically, the referee might have you make a few checks over the course of days to see how well you perform or if any mishaps occur, rather than one giant firefight roll.)

## Heavy Weapons  
*Heavy Weapons* covers man-portable and vehicle heavy weapons like rocket launchers, artillery, and such. Specialties: Launchers (rocket and grenade launchers), Man-Portable Artillery (e.g. FGMP plasma guns), and Field Artillery (mortars, howitzers). This skill is about weapons that cause significant destruction and typically aren’t “small arms”.

- **Arm and Fire Launcher** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In a second or two, bring a prepared heavy weapon to bear and fire it. For example, you might shoulder-fire a rocket launcher almost as quickly as someone else would fire a rifle, because you have it ready and know exactly how to aim and squeeze off the shot. (This assumes the weapon was already in hand and maybe pre-armed; the skill shaves down the aiming time to nearly instantaneous.)  
- **Shoot & Scoot** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Fire a heavy weapon and move to a new position within a few seconds. This tactic is common with things like RPGs – you pop up, fire, then immediately run or duck to avoid counter-fire. Over 6–36 seconds, you unleash a rocket or grenade and get ~tens of meters away or into cover. Heavy Weapons skill ensures the shot was placed decently even with minimal setup, and you handle the weapon’s backblast or recoil safely.  
- **Deploy Heavy Weapon** *(STR, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, set up a heavy weapon for firing. This might mean unfolding a tripod for a machine gun, setting a mortar’s base plate and dropping a round in, or propping a plasma projector and charging it up. In 10–60 seconds, thanks to practice, you get the weapon into firing configuration. If it’s a team-served weapon, you as the skilled heavy weapons operator can direct your assistants to make it efficient.  
- **Correct Artillery Fire** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes observing where heavy fire landed and adjust the next shot. For instance, you fire a mortar round, watch the explosion land 50m off target, then in 1–6 minutes you calculate the adjustment (change angle, adjust charge) and fire again, much closer to target. This includes communicating with spotters or reading targeting telemetry in more complex setups. The timeframe represents maybe firing a couple of ranging shots and then being dialed in.  
- **Emplace Defensive Gun** *(EDU/INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over up to an hour, set up a heavy weapon position with cover and fields of fire. If defending an outpost, you might take 10–60 minutes to dig a fighting pit for an autocannon, camouflage it, zero it on likely approach routes, and coordinate range cards. Heavy Weapons skill combined with tactical sense (Tactics skill could assist) leads to an optimal setup that will be very hard for enemies to assault.  
- **Fire Support Mission** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, operate a heavy weapon as fire support for an ongoing battle. For example, you man a mortar or field gun during a prolonged firefight or siege, periodically lobbing shells whenever called. In 1–6 hours of intermittent firing, you manage ammo, keep the barrel cool, and adjust aim based on requests from allied forces. This is essentially providing artillery coverage in a battle scenario (like pinning down enemy positions or breaking up counter-attacks whenever they mass).  
- **Maintain Big Gun** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day cleaning, repairing, and maintaining a heavy weapon system. Perhaps after heavy use, you strip a machine gun down and replace its barrel, or you tune the guidance system of a portable missile launcher. In 4–24 hours you bring the weapon back to top condition, maybe even modifying it slightly (e.g. adjusting a trigger mechanism for reliability). This overlaps with *Mechanic*, but Heavy Weapons skill provides the specific knowledge of this weapon’s quirks.  
- **Train Heavy Weapons Crew** *(SOC/EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days (10–60 hours), drill a team in using a heavy weapon effectively together. You might be an artillery sergeant teaching a crew how to load, aim, and fire a howitzer rapidly and safely, or instructing a group of resistance fighters in the use of a captured rocket launcher. By the end, their coordination and safety improve (they won’t, say, stand behind the recoilless rifle when it fires), and they know basic fire discipline.  
- **Siege Artillery Operation** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – Participate in a continuous heavy weapons operation over many days, such as a siege or sustained bombardment campaign. For 1–6 days, you could be manning a giant howitzer that fires at set intervals around the clock, or operating a plasma battery to deter starship landings. You manage extreme fatigue, overheating systems, and resupply issues. Heavy Weapons skill is critical to avoid catastrophic failures (like a shell exploding in the barrel or a guidance malfunction sending rounds off-target). At this scale, you might interface with *Engineer* and *Tactics* skills as well (for maintaining the emplacements and planning the barrage pattern, respectively).

## Investigate  
*Investigate* involves keen observation, forensics, and detailed analysis of evidence. It is used to search for clues, analyze crime scenes, and solve puzzles by gathering information.

- **Quick Glance Assessment** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Size up a situation or scene at a glance for anything obviously amiss. In a second or two, an investigator might notice blood drops that others missed or see that a drawer is slightly ajar. This immediate gut check can reveal whether something is worth a closer look.  
- **Frisk/Pocket Search** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Pat down a person or rummage through a small container quickly (in under half a minute) to find hidden items. A skilled searcher can detect a concealed weapon or contraband in a few seconds by touch and intuition, unless the hiding spot is exceptionally clever.  
- **Eavesdrop Moment** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Listen in on a snippet of conversation or sound for under a minute to pick out useful info. For example, you pause outside a door for ~30 seconds and catch someone mentioning a name or clue, or you listen to echoes in a cave to guess what might be ahead. Investigate helps you focus on the important details in that short span.  
- **Examine Clue** *(INT or EDU, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes closely inspecting a single clue or object. You might read a note for hidden meanings, check a corpse’s visible wounds, or test a key in nearby locks. In 1–6 minutes, you can deduce one or two facts (like “The mud on these boots is from the riverbank, not the farm – our suspect lied about where he’s been”). This is the typical quick analysis in detective work.  
- **Canvas for Information** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Interview people or search a small area for about an hour to gather leads. For example, going door-to-door on a street asking if anyone saw something, or chatting up patrons at a bar for rumors. In 10–60 minutes you compile a set of observations. *Investigate* helps separate reliable info from gossip and asks the right questions without tipping your hand. (This can pair with *Streetwise* in rough neighborhoods or *Persuade* to encourage talking.)  
- **Search Crime Scene** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Conduct a thorough search of a room or location over several hours. In 1–6 hours, you meticulously go over everything: look under carpets, dust for prints, collect fibers, check computer logs, etc. The skill ensures you don’t miss subtle evidence. By the end, you should have a collection of clues (or confidently say there’s nothing to find). This is standard procedure for detectives and forensic teams.  
- **Research Background** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day researching archives, databases, or libraries for information relevant to a mystery. For 4–24 hours, you might pull public records, news articles, or historical data. Investigate skill aids in knowing where to look and recognizing which bits of lore connect to your case (“Ah, this symbol was also seen in an incident 50 years ago…”). At completion, you compile a report of background info that could shed light on motives or patterns.  
- **Surveillance Operation** *(INT/END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, maintain a surveillance of persons or places of interest. For 10–60 hours, possibly broken into shifts, you track a suspect’s activities, stake out a building through long hours, and keep detailed logs. Investigate skill helps you remain inconspicuous (*Stealth* may assist) and notice important behaviors (like a suspect meeting someone or hiding an item). By the end, you have a timeline of the target’s actions to analyze.  
- **Crack the Case** *(INT, 1D days)* – Synthesize all gathered clues and follow up on leads over days to solve a complex mystery. In 1–6 days of intense work, you might revisit scenes, question more people, test hypotheses, and finally arrive at the solution (identifying the culprit, the cause of a phenomenon, the location of a lost item, etc.). This extended task could involve multiple smaller checks (like an *Investigate* task chain), but at the end of the period you either have the “Eureka” moment or conclude the case has gone cold. A high *Investigate* skill greatly increases the chance that the outcome is a success with all pieces put together correctly.

## Jack of All Trades  
*Jack of All Trades* (JoT) works differently from other skills: it reduces the unskilled penalty by 1 per level instead of being rolled directly. It reflects broad, general know-how. While you normally **don’t make a JoT check**, we can illustrate how having JoT enables attempts of unfamiliar tasks across various timeframes:

- **Snap Intuition** *(Varies, 1D seconds)* – You’re confronted with a task outside your expertise and react on instinct. In a second or two, your broad experience kicks in. For example, a strange machine starts to overload (an Engineering problem): even without that skill, your *Jack of All Trades* background means you recall a similar situation and you hit the off-switch (rolling perhaps just INT with a smaller penalty). Essentially, JoT lets you **try** an unfamiliar action immediately with some hope of success.  
- **Hasty Attempt** *(Varies, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Over a few seconds, attempt an emergency action you’re not trained for, with JoT mitigating disaster. For instance, if the pilot is down, you grab the controls of a grav vehicle. In 6–36 seconds, you manage to keep it level and maybe even land it roughly. Normally an untrained person would be at **–3 DM**, but if you have JoT-2, that penalty drops to –1, giving you a fighting chance to pull it off.  
- **Untrained Fix** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute jury-rigging or fixing something in a field not your own. Maybe the party’s medic is absent and someone’s bleeding – you use JoT to recall a vid you saw about tourniquets. In 10–60 seconds, you apply first aid (rolling Medicine at effectively lower penalty). It might not be pretty, but the patient is stabilized.  
- **Cross-Discipline Analysis** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to analyze a problem outside your knowledge by drawing parallels. Perhaps you don’t have Science (Geology), but when examining unusual crystals, you liken it to metalwork you know – concluding they formed under high heat. With 1–6 minutes of thought and JoT reducing penalties, you glean a basic insight that a trained specialist would confirm.  
- **Assist Expert** *(Varies, 1D x 10 minutes)* – For up to an hour, assist someone performing a task you have no training in. Thanks to JoT, you aren’t a hindrance and can actually be helpful. For example, you help the Engineer repair the jump drive by handing tools and following instructions. Normally an untrained helper might make things worse; your JoT Level 1 or 2 means you follow along competently. In game terms, you might provide a +1 aid in a task chain instead of 0 or –DM because you’re applying generalized knowledge.  
- **Learn on the Fly** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours learning the basics of a new skill through trial, error, and intuition. Maybe you have never touched a vacc suit, but during a long spacewalk (with JoT reducing unskilled penalties) you figure out how to maneuver and even fix minor issues. After 1–6 hours of doing it hands-on, you’re not *skilled* but you’re no longer completely lost. Essentially, JoT lets you treat that time as productive training, possibly justifying granting Skill-0 in extreme cases or at least success in the current scenario.  
- **Jury-Rig Project** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, complete a project that normally requires a specialist skill, by improvising. For example, building a basic water purifier (which might normally need Trade (engineering) or Mechanic). With 4–24 hours of tinkering, using whatever knowledge you can scrounge from library data and your general background, you produce a working if not elegant solution. JoT reduces the chance of catastrophic failure – your device works, albeit perhaps in a crude way.  
- **Crash Course** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, teach yourself enough of a skill to handle a specific task. Say you need to decode a transmission but have no *Computers* skill. You spend 10–60 hours reading manuals, trying code, and using JoT to fill gaps. By the end, you might not be a hacker, but you manage to write a script to decode the message (you effectively performed a one-time task at a reduced unskilled penalty, or even Skill-0 level for that task only).  
- **Fill in for Expert** *(Varies, 1D days)* – Act in a professional role you’re not trained for over several days. Imagine you must pose as the ship’s medic for a week-long voyage because the real medic died. For 1–6 days you handle patients’ routine issues, using autodocs and common sense. Jack of All Trades means each medical task you attempt (diagnosing an illness, treating a fever) is only slightly hampered instead of impossible. By the end of the week, the passengers never realized their doctor was an imposter – you managed to muddle through with general competence.

> *Note:* **Jack of All Trades** is not typically rolled as a skill check on its own. The above examples show how having JoT allows a character to **attempt** or assist with tasks of other skills by reducing the normal unskilled penalty. A JoT expert can make an untrained attempt almost as good as a trained one, given enough time.

## Language  
*Language* covers reading, writing, and speaking languages other than one’s native tongue. Each language (e.g. Anglic, Vilani, Zhodani) is a separate specialty. Having Language 0 means you know a smattering of many languages. Automated translators exist, but knowing languages gives more nuance.

- **Recognize Tongue** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Upon hearing a word or phrase, instantly identify the language (or one of its dialects). In a second or two, your linguistic ear picks up that the merchants over there are speaking _Hivertrade_ and not Galanglic. This can inform you whether you need a translator or if something secret is being discussed.  
- **Basic Greeting** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a brief moment (a few seconds), recall and speak a simple greeting or polite phrase in a language you’re only somewhat familiar with. For instance, you meet Vargr traders and say hello in their tongue with a passable accent. It’s not a full conversation, but it sets a friendly tone and shows respect, likely granting a small positive reaction bonus.  
- **Get the Gist** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to interpret the general meaning of a short written text or sign in an unfamiliar language. Perhaps you stare at a warning sign with alien symbols and, using linguistic logic, discern it’s indicating “Danger: Radiation” or something similar. In 10–60 seconds, you don’t translate word-for-word, but you extract key words or icons that give you a rough idea.  
- **Conduct Small Talk** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes in basic conversation in a language you know at least a little. In 1–6 minutes, you exchange simple pleasantries or queries (“Where is the market?”, “Lovely weather today.”). Language skill ensures you avoid major grammatical errors. With skill 0 this may be halting but functional; at higher levels, even a few minutes of small talk can be nearly fluent for simple topics.  
- **Translate Note** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Work for up to an hour to translate a paragraph or two of text from one language to another. For example, you have an old Vilani contract and you translate it into Anglic for your crew. In 10–60 minutes, you produce a reasonable translation, capturing the essential meaning (nuances might depend on your skill level). This can be done by hand or verbally (reading it out as you go).  
- **Conversational Interpretation** *(SOC/INT, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, facilitate a conversation or negotiation between speakers of different languages. Say you speak both Aslan and Anglic; during a 1–6 hour meeting you translate each side’s statements and nuances. Language skill helps you pick appropriate words so nothing is lost or insult given. Maintaining this for hours is tiring (hence INT to concentrate or SOC to convey tone), but you act as an effective live translator.  
- **Learn New Phrases** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day studying and practicing a language to improve your capability. In 4–24 hours, you might use a language course or immersion practice to expand your vocabulary and grasp a bit of grammar. For instance, while in port for a day, you learn a dozen useful phrases in the local dialect. This could give you an edge (maybe eliminating the unskilled penalty when using those specific phrases, or just making RP interactions smoother).  
- **Translate Document** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Translate a lengthy text (like a chapter of a book or a legal document) over a couple of days. In 10–60 hours, carefully go through, possibly with reference materials, and produce a faithful translation. A character with Language skill at a high level could even translate literature or poetry, preserving subtleties. At lower skill, you get the literal meaning across, though any poetry becomes prose.  
- **Attain Basic Fluency** *(INT/EDU, 1D days)* – Through immersion or intensive study over 1–6 days, reach a survival fluency in a new language (or significantly improve your command of one you only knew a little). For example, spending a week with local guides on an alien world, you pick up enough of their tongue to handle everyday situations without a translator. In game terms, the referee might grant you Language (XYZ) 0 if you had none, or allow you to communicate simple ideas without rolls. It’s not complete fluency, but you’ll make far fewer mistakes.

## Leadership  
*Leadership* involves directing, inspiring, and rallying allies. It’s used to coordinate team actions, give orders under stress, and maintain morale.

- **Battle Cry** *(SOC, 1D seconds)* – Shout a quick command or encouragement to allies in the heat of the moment. In a second or two, you might yell “Charge!” or “Stand firm, everyone!” A good battle cry with Leadership can grant allies a burst of courage or focus (perhaps negating a round of panic or providing a +1 DM on their next action if the GM allows). It’s short, loud, and to the point – an immediate morale boost.  
- **Tactical Order** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Issue a concise tactical instruction in a short timeframe (a combat round or two). For example: “Squad Alpha, flank left in 10 seconds!” or “Sniper, take out that gunner now.” In 6–36 seconds you communicate a plan. If allies follow it, their actions might be better coordinated (the GM could give a small bonus for the next coordinated attack or impose a penalty on the enemy due to being outmaneuvered). Leadership skill ensures your order is clear and authoritative even under fire.  
- **Rally Ally** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend up to a minute to rally a shaken or demoralized comrade. Perhaps a fellow Traveller is pinned down and frightened; you take 10–60 seconds (maybe using your action to get to them and speak in cover) to clap their shoulder, meet their eyes and say, “You can do this. I need you.” With a successful Leadership check, you could remove the effects of fear or shock on that ally, getting them back into the fight.  
- **Coordinate Task** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to organize a group for a complex task. Say your crew needs to load cargo quickly or several characters are trying to repair different parts of a ship. In 1–6 minutes, you assign roles: “You two handle the winch, you guide the hovercart, I’ll secure crates.” Everyone knows what to do, so the task proceeds efficiently. Mechanically, this could reduce the time required for the group task or provide a +1 on each participant’s skill check due to lack of interference and clear roles.  
- **Brief Team** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Deliver a briefing or plan to your team over the course of tens of minutes (up to an hour). For instance, before a dangerous mission, you gather the group, lay out the objectives, discuss tactics, and answer questions. This structured preparation (10–60 minutes) means everyone understands the mission. In game terms, this might allow you to set up a Task Chain where your Leadership roll provides a DM bonus to each member’s first relevant action in the mission (e.g., the ambush plan’s success).  
- **Train Unit** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, train or drill your team or troops in a particular formation or skill. If you have a day in transit, you might run combat drills for 1–6 hours, improving coordination. Or during downtime, you instruct junior crew on emergency procedures. At the end of it, your people act with more unity (the GM might allow a one-time bonus or reduced panic in actual emergencies due to this practice). Leadership is key to keeping the training focused and motivating the trainees to take it seriously.  
- **Plan Operations** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day formulating a detailed plan for a larger operation. This could involve mapping out a heist or a battle strategy. Over 4–24 hours, you gather intel (with help from Recon or Investigate), consider resources, assign sub-leaders, and create contingency plans. The result is a set of orders or an operational timeline everyone can follow. When the operation unfolds, because of your planning, the group might avoid some pitfalls (“We expected the power to go out here, switch to nightvision now!”). Leadership skill ensures the plan is neither too complicated nor too vague, hitting a useful balance.  
- **Boost Morale (Campaign)** *(SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, implement measures to raise the morale of a group. If you’re the captain of a ship going through a dull and stressful two-week jump, you spend 10–60 hours of that jump organizing activities: movie nights, friendly competitions, personal check-ins with each crew member. Or in an army camp, you arrange rotation for leave and give rousing nightly speeches. Leadership in this long-term way means when the crunch comes, your people won’t crack – they feel valued and motivated. (In game terms, perhaps providing a bonus against mental stress or loyalty checks in the future.)  
- **Lead Prolonged Mission** *(END/SOC, 1D days)* – For 1–6 days (or potentially weeks, but using the longest timeframe here as representative), be the leader in the field during a continuous operation. Think of a starship captain during a week of shipwrecked survival in the jungle, or a platoon leader in a week-long march and series of skirmishes behind enemy lines. You keep the group together through hardships, maintain discipline, and make tough decisions about when to push on vs. rest. Each day brings new challenges (hunger, conflict, fatigue) and you address them. By the end of this period, if successful, the mission is accomplished and your team is still cohesive rather than mutinous or scattered. Leadership skill, plus endurance, was critical in not showing panic or exhaustion – as a leader you set the example.

## Life Sciences  
*Life Sciences* is one of the Science skills (the others being Physical, Social, Space) focusing on living organisms. Specialties include Biology, Cybernetics, Genetics, Psionicology. It’s used for scientific understanding of life forms and potentially practical biotech applications.

- **Identify Species** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Immediately recognize a plant or creature species (or at least genus) by sight or obvious traits. In a second or two, a biologist can tell “that’s a native Venusian fungus” or “this bug is related to Terran cockroaches.” Even if you haven’t seen it, you might identify it as *similar* to known species. This can help in knowing if it’s dangerous or useful.  
- **Assess Vital Signs** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Spend a few seconds to gauge the health or condition of a living organism using scientific understanding. For a person or animal, you might check pulse, pupil response, and reflexes and quickly surmise if they are poisoned, dehydrated, etc. For a plant, maybe you notice if it’s wilting or diseased. While a Medic would treat issues, a life scientist might identify underlying causes (like “these symptoms suggest a toxin, not a pathogen”).  
- **Field Test Sample** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, perform a quick field test on a biological sample. Perhaps you carry reagent strips or a handheld bioscanner. You could determine if water is contaminated by certain bacteria, or if a blood sample contains a known pathogen, by applying a chemical dip or using a tricorder-like device. In 10–60 seconds, you get a simple positive/negative type result which informs further action.  
- **Examine Creature** *(INT/EDU, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes examining a life form or biological phenomenon up close. For example, you might inspect a strange alien creature’s behavior and morphology for 1–6 minutes to deduce its diet or whether it’s sapient. Or examine a pet’s odd symptoms to guess its illness. With Life Sciences knowledge, you connect what you observe to scientific principles (like “six-limbed structure… likely hexapedal evolution, probably an herbivore given those teeth”). This yields a hypothesis about the organism.  
- **Run Lab Analysis** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Use a laboratory (or lab kit) to analyze biological samples over tens of minutes. You could sequence a short DNA fragment, culture a bacteria on a rapid medium, or test soil for microorganisms. In 10–60 minutes, initial results come in (e.g., “bacteria colonies identified as _Thermophilus X_, which indicates the water came from a hot spring”). Life Science skill ensures proper technique and interpretation of these quick lab tests.  
- **Dissect or Autopsy** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, dissect a specimen or perform an autopsy with scientific rigor. In 1–6 hours, you can open up a dead creature, examine its organs, and determine cause of death or how its biology works. For example, autopsying a strange animal might reveal it has two hearts and venom sacs, explaining why it was so tough and how it killed its prey. This yields detailed biological information and perhaps physical evidence (like a tissue sample or a parasitic organism found inside).  
- **Research Organism** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a day researching and observing a life form or ecological phenomenon. This could include reading scientific literature, running controlled experiments, and making observations in the field. In 4–24 hours, you gather comprehensive data on, say, the breeding habits of a local fauna or the properties of an alien fungus. At the end, you likely produce a report or at least have a clear understanding to share with others (e.g., “Don’t eat those berries – our tests show they contain neurotoxins unique to this planet!”).  
- **Develop Biological Theory** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Work over a few days on forming or proving a hypothesis in the life sciences. For example, you suspect a link between a planet’s magnetic field and the migration pattern of indigenous birds. Over 10–60 hours, you gather data, perhaps simulate conditions, compare with known biology, and refine a theory. This is a scholarly pursuit – at the end, you might have a publishable paper or at least a robust explanation for the observed phenomenon.  
- **Bioengineering Project** *(INT/EDU, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days, apply life science knowledge to a practical project such as creating a genetically modified organism (GMO) or synthesizing a biological compound. For instance, you attempt to splice a glowing jellyfish gene into a local plant to make bioluminescent crops, or you brew a batch of antibiotics from fungus to cure a disease. Such advanced tasks likely require lab equipment and possibly multiple skill checks (Science, Medic, Engineer might come into play). Life Science skill guides the theoretical design and interpretation of results each day. By the end of the period, you may have a prototype organism/compound or at least a conclusive success/failure result to report. (Edge case example: In a campaign, this could be how the team develops a cure for an alien plague – several days in the lab isolating and growing a counter-virus.)

## Mechanic  
*Mechanic* allows maintaining and repairing most equipment (generally non-electronic gear and vehicles). It’s the go-to skill for fixing engines, assembling machinery, and handling general mechanical tasks (distinct from high-tech systems covered by Engineer or Electronics specialties).

- **Spot Mechanical Issue** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly notice a mechanical problem or hear something “off.” For example, in a second you recognize that an engine’s knocking sound means a piston timing issue, or you see that a support strut on a vehicle is cracked. Your trained eye/ear catches what untrained folks would miss at first glance.  
- **Clear Jam** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, clear a jam or misfeed in mechanical equipment. This could be kicking a stuck gear loose, re-seating a jammed ammo belt in a turret (if not covered by Gunner, but Mechanic would help for the physical jam), or unjamming a door mechanism. Within 6–36 seconds you free the moving parts and get it working again.  
- **Tighten Bolts** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to make a quick adjustment that prevents a bigger problem. For example, you notice a vehicle’s wheel is wobbling; you spend 30 seconds with a spanner tightening the lug nuts. Or a piece of hull plating is rattling on the ship, you quickly weld or bolt it down in less than a minute. This preventative maintenance heads off potential failure.  
- **Field Maintenance** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes servicing equipment to keep it operational. That could be oiling and cleaning a machine gun after use (overlapping with Gun Combat maintenance), or cleaning an engine’s air filters in your ATV out in the field. In 1–6 minutes, you perform the basics that ensure the device continues working until you can do a full shop maintenance.  
- **Repair Device** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Fix a broken or damaged piece of equipment in an hour or less. For example, you repair a busted water pump or jury-rig a broken sensor rig’s moving parts (not the electronics, just the rotating mount). In 10–60 minutes, using spare parts or creativity (like cannibalizing other gear), you get the device functioning at least temporarily. The success depends on how severe the damage is and the Effect of your Mechanic check.  
- **Overhaul Engine** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Work for several hours to tune up or rebuild a machine’s engine or core systems. In 1–6 hours, you might replace worn parts, recalibrate timing, and flush fluids on a ground car’s engine, improving its performance or reliability. For a starship or other complex tech, Mechanic can handle the simpler mechanical elements (like repairing a hydraulics leak in landing gear or swapping out a fusion regulator’s cracked casing, leaving the high-tech innards to Engineer). After this overhaul, the system runs much smoother or is back to standard performance if it was failing.  
- **Vehicle Modifications** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a day installing or removing mechanical modifications on a vehicle. Over 4–24 hours, you could mount bull-bars and extra armor plates on a truck, or swap the wheels of a rover for better off-road ones. Alternatively, remove a faulty power coupling and replace it with a new one that fits differently (taking time to make it compatible). At the end, the vehicle has new capabilities or the mechanical modification is complete. (Electronics or specialized skills might be needed for some parts, but Mechanic covers the physical install and fit.)  
- **Fabricate/Build Machine** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, build a mechanical contraption from scratch or from a kit. For instance, you build a motorcycle from spare parts, or assemble a complex water purifier for a colony. It takes 10–60 hours of work, including measuring, cutting, welding, bolting pieces together. Mechanic skill ensures the final product works (assuming parts were adequate). This could be done during downtime on a long trip – at the end, you unveil the constructed item to your companions.  
- **Restore Vehicle/Equipment** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days, fully restore a heavily damaged or antiquated piece of machinery. This could be refurbishing a classic gravcar you found in a junkyard or repairing a starship’s jump drive *mechanical* components after a misjump (while the Engineer handles the calibration). You will disassemble systems, clean everything, replace gaskets, realign structures (maybe using heavy tools or workshop facilities). After days of labor, the machine is back in working order or even like new. This is a combination of many small repairs, which Mechanic orchestrates systematically.

## Medic  
*Medic* covers medical care: first aid, surgery, diagnosis, and long-term care. From patching up wounds in combat to running a hospital, this is the skill for healing.

- **Staunch Bleeding** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In a second or two, apply immediate pressure or a tourniquet to a severe bleeding wound. This instant action can halt blood loss long enough to prevent a patient from slipping into critical condition. In game terms, if someone is making an END check to avoid death from bleeding, a Medic with quick action might give them a bonus or stabilize them at the last second.  
- **Primary Survey (ABC)** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a matter of seconds (6–36 sec), perform the primary trauma survey: Airway, Breathing, Circulation. You check if the patient’s airway is clear, if they’re breathing, and if they have a pulse or major bleeding. This rapid assessment identifies life-threatening issues. A skilled Medic can do this extremely fast and efficiently, ensuring no time is wasted on the wrong problem.  
- **Drug Injection** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Retrieve and administer a drug or hypospray in under a minute. For example, jab a wounded ally with a dose of painkiller or antibiotic, or give a stimulant to someone falling unconscious. In 10–60 seconds you’ve rifled through the medkit, found the correct auto-injector, and delivered it. This could instantly stabilize shock (with the right drug) or counteract a poison if done promptly.  
- **First Aid** *(EDU, 1D minutes)* – Treat immediate injuries in the field over a few minutes. In 1–6 minutes, you clean and bandage wounds, set simple fractures, and maybe administer broad-spectrum anti-toxins. Mechanically, this is the standard Medic first aid check that can heal a small amount of damage if done within a minute of injury. Even if time’s a bit beyond that, it prevents infection and starts the healing process.  
- **Diagnose Ailment** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour examining a patient or analyzing symptoms to diagnose an illness or condition. You might run a few basic tests (thermometer, blood sugar, reflexes) and consult a medical database if available. In 10–60 minutes, you come up with a diagnosis like “These symptoms indicate Vargus Fever, which is treated with drug X” or “The patient has a cracked rib and mild concussion.” A successful Medic roll yields a reliable diagnosis, guiding further treatment.  
- **Surgery** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Perform a surgical operation taking several hours. In 1–6 hours you could suture internal injuries, remove a bullet from a gut, or excise infected tissue. This requires proper tools (a ship’s medbay or field surgery kit). Medic skill determines success and outcomes like how much damage is healed or if there are complications. After completion, the patient should be in much better shape, though needing rest. **Example:** A middling difficult surgery might be Average (8+) and take 1D hours – a skilled Medic increases the odds of success.  
- **Extended Care** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Provide ongoing medical care over half a day. For 4–24 hours, you monitor vitals, change dressings, administer IV fluids and medications at intervals. This could be in an ICU or a sickbay. By the end, you’ve kept the patient stable and maybe accelerated recovery. In game terms, this could give a bonus to natural healing rolls or help someone recover from disease faster, as per extended care rules (where someone with Medic tending a patient can double healing rates, etc.).  
- **Medical Research** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, research a medical problem or develop a treatment. Maybe there’s an alien pathogen afflicting the crew; you spend 10–60 hours in the lab analyzing it and testing medicines (likely involving Science skill too, but Medic to apply biomedical knowledge practically). Alternatively, develop an antidote for a poison by analyzing its effects and synthesizing a countercompound. After this period, you might roll Medic or Science to see if you succeeded in finding a cure or new insight.  
- **Convalescent Care** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days, care for a recovering patient to ensure full recovery. This is like nursing care or rehab guidance. You help them do physical therapy, ensure they take all medications, and prevent bedsores or complications. After this, a patient might regain stat points lost from severe injuries or recover from a long illness properly. In narrative terms, this is how a Medic spends the week aboard ship while the injured marine slowly gets back on his feet, guaranteeing that he’s mission-ready by arrival. (Mechanically, the referee could say the patient heals to full by the end of jump if under care, rather than rolling each day’s healing.)

## Melee  
*Melee* covers hand-to-hand combat, whether unarmed or with melee weapons. Specialties: Unarmed Combat, Blade, Bludgeon, Natural Weapons, etc., but all involve striking or fighting up close.

- **Parry/Block** *(DEX/STR, 1D seconds)* – React in an instant to block an incoming melee attack. Within a second, you raise your arm, weapon, or appropriate limb to deflect a blow. In game terms, this could be represented by a defensive melee roll or a parry giving a negative DM to your attacker. A skilled melee fighter can interpose a sword or arm instinctively to **reduce the impact** of a hit if the rules allow defensive actions.  
- **Strike Combination** *(STR/DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Launch a flurry of blows over a few seconds. In 6–36 seconds (a typical combat round or two), you might jab, cross, and roundhouse kick an opponent (unarmed) or swing a sword in a quick series of attacks. This corresponds to the normal melee attack action, but with *Melee* skill you might attempt multiple strikes (for example, attacking two weaker foes in one round, depending on rules for multiple attacks).  
- **Grapple/Takedown** *(STR, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Engage in a grapple or attempt a takedown move that can last up to a minute in a struggle. For example, you rush an enemy, grab them, and try to pin them to the ground. It might take 10–60 seconds of wrestling to get a solid pin or choke hold. *Melee (unarmed)* helps maintain control and counter their resistance. In RPG terms, this might be several opposed checks; the timeframe indicates it’s not instantaneous, it’s an ongoing contest of strength and technique.  
- **Dueling** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Fight a one-on-one duel that lasts a few minutes. Cinematically, think of two fencers or swordsmen exchanging dozens of blows, testing each other’s defenses, circling, maybe with a bit of banter, until one finds an opening. In 1–6 minutes, a duel between skilled melee combatants can be resolved – likely with one disarmed, wounded, or conceding. The *Melee (blade)* skill would be central here for feints and ripostes. Mechanically, multiple melee attack rounds happen within this narrative timeframe.  
- **Subdue Opponent** *(STR, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Wrestle and subdue an unwilling opponent without severely injuring them, over the course of up to an hour. For example, you’re a guard trying to restrain a crazed crew member. Over 10–60 minutes you may have to repeatedly grab them as they escape, hold them down as they thrash, and perhaps tie them up. The extended timeframe is if they’re persistent or you’re waiting for them to tire out. A successful *Melee* application here means you accomplish the restraint without having to resort to knocking them unconscious (though you might end up with a few bruises yourself).  
- **Sparring Session** *(END/DEX, 1D hours)* – Engage in training melee combat for a few hours. You and a partner practice techniques, perhaps with blunted weapons or gloves, for 1–6 hours. This builds skill and endurance. From a training perspective, doing this regularly could justify skill improvement in downtime. In-game, a sparring session might also be how you test an NPC’s capabilities (“Let’s spar a bit, to see how good you really are”). Leadership or instruction could be involved if you’re teaching.  
- **Stand Guard (Close Combat)** *(END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Stay ready for close-quarters combat over a long watch (4–24 hours). For example, guarding a gate with a pike or stun baton in hand. It’s mostly boring, but you must remain alert and physically ready to spring into melee at any moment. Melee skill combined with endurance helps stave off fatigue and react correctly if a sudden scuffle breaks out. After hours of nothing happening, you’re still poised to crack heads if needed, rather than dozing off.  
- **Intensive Training (Martial Art)** *(DEX, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days (10–60 hours), undergo intensive martial arts or melee training. Perhaps you go to a dojo workshop or boot camp focusing on knife fighting. This might involve repetitive drills, forms/katas practice, strength conditioning specific to grappling or striking. Such training could give a temporary edge or count as study toward raising the skill. In narrative, after a 3-day intensive (say 36 hours total training), your style might evolve – maybe you learned a disarm technique (GM could allow a one-time bonus to disarm attempts).  
- **Tournament Competition** *(END/DEX, 1D days)* – Participate in a formal melee tournament or series of fights over several days. For 1–6 days, you might have daily bouts in an arena or ring. You need to manage stamina (maybe two fights in a day, then finals the next day), recover from bruises each night, and adapt your tactics against different styles. Melee skill is paramount each fight, but leadership or psyching out opponents could help too. By the end of the tournament, if you’ve consistently applied your skill well, you might emerge champion. This is an edge case of sustained melee encounters spread out, where mental resilience and learning from each fight play a role.

## Navigation  
*Navigation* is finding directions and plotting courses on the ground or within a planet’s atmosphere (the counterpart to *Astrogation* but planet-side). It covers map-reading, compass use, and pathfinding through terrain.

- **Orient Self** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Immediately figure out the cardinal directions or orientation if you have a moment to think. In a second or two, you recall where the sun was or use a wrist compass or even the stars (at night) to determine which way is north (or local equivalent). A navigator rarely stays disoriented for more than an instant; even inside a building, you have a sense of which way you came from.  
- **Choose Correct Path** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – At a fork in a road or a trail split, decide within half a minute which path leads toward your destination. Using intuition and any available cues (signs, slope of terrain, sun position), you make a quick choice rather than wasting time debating. This helps avoid wrong turns. It might not always be correct if clues were misleading, but a skilled navigator has a good chance.  
- **Consult Map on the Move** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – While walking or riding, take under a minute to glance at a map or datapad and verify your route. In 10–60 seconds, without fully stopping the group, you correlate the landmarks you see with the map. This quick navigation check ensures you’re still on course, or alerts you if you’ve veered off so you can correct immediately.  
- **Plot Detour** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes calculating an alternate route due to an unforeseen obstacle. For example, a bridge is out or a road is blocked; in 1–6 minutes looking at your maps or memory, you find a back road or trail around the problem. This might involve recognizing terrain features that allow passage (like “we can ford the river upstream”) or recalling a secondary road.  
- **Urban Navigation** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Navigate through a city or dense area over tens of minutes. In 10–60 minutes you get from point A to B using surface streets, perhaps without a GPS. You rely on a combination of map memory, reading street signs, and asking for directions (which *Streetwise* might help with). *Navigation* skill ensures you don’t get lost in a maze of alleys and that any wrong turns are corrected quickly.  
- **Trailblazing** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Spend a few hours to find a viable path through difficult terrain where none is clearly marked. In 1–6 hours, for example, you scout through a forest to find a passable route for your vehicle or group, marking trees or noting landmarks. You might have to double back a few times, but by the end you have a trail flagged. Allies following you will travel faster since you did the hard work.  
- **Land Navigation Exercise** *(INT/END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, undertake a lengthy navigation task – e.g., a military land-nav course or a trek across rolling hills – hitting multiple checkpoints. For 4–24 hours you follow a planned course, perhaps set by someone else, and use compass, protractor, and maps to find specific coordinate points. This tests endurance (hiking long distances) and skill (finding each point accurately). A character with good Navigation will end the exercise having found all checkpoints in time, while others might have missed one or gotten turned around.  
- **Cross-Country Expedition** *(INT/END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Lead a group on a cross-country journey spanning a couple of days (10–60 hours of travel). You must break this up for rest, but overall you maintain bearing across various terrains – plains, forests, maybe minor rivers to cross. With Navigation skill, you choose good camps (near water, defensible), keep a steady efficient pace, and arrive where you intended. This might correspond to a scout moving an army unit from one locale to another without roads, or explorers traversing an unexplored region guided by stars and compass.  
- **Chart Region Map** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Systematically explore and map an area over 1–6 days. Essentially, you act as a cartographer: travelling through each sector of a region, taking bearings to prominent features (mountains, lakes), and sketching them. You likely form a rough map by the end of each day and refine it as you go. At the end of the task, you produce a usable map of what was previously uncharted land (or update an inaccurate map). Navigation skill ensures distances and directions are reasonably accurate (within the tech available’s precision).

## Persuade  
*Persuade* is the casual, informal art of convincing others – akin to Diplomacy but more everyday. It covers charm, rhetoric, and basic negotiation in social situations.

- **Suggest Action** *(SOC, 1D seconds)* – In a second or two, slip in a quick suggestion to influence someone’s immediate choice. For example, as a guard hesitates, you blurt, “It’s okay, let them through,” in a reassuring tone. Or you say to a friend “Maybe now’s a good time to leave,” hoping they take the hint. With Persuade, even a brief comment can plant the seed of an idea effectively.  
- **Convincing Statement** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Make a short case or point in a few sentences (up to ~30 seconds) that sways someone’s opinion slightly. For instance, at a marketplace stall, you say, “Look, this device is a bit scuffed. How about knocking a few credits off?” – a quick argument for a discount. Or interject in a debate with one compelling fact or anecdote. Persuade helps ensure your concise point hits home emotionally or logically.  
- **Charm Offensive** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Use charm or charisma in under a minute to put someone at ease or make them receptive to you. Perhaps in 10–60 seconds of light conversation, compliments, or humor, you turn a bureaucrat’s initial coldness into a friendly willingness to help. Mechanically, this could turn an NPC’s attitude from neutral to favorable (or hostile to neutral) temporarily, making subsequent requests easier.  
- **Request Favor** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to persuade someone to do a small favor for you. For example, you chat with a bartender for 1–6 minutes and then ask if he can give you a heads-up when a certain patron arrives. Or you talk to a shipyard worker and persuade her to work an extra hour to finish repairs on your ship sooner. With a successful Persuade, they agree because you made a good case or they just like you. The favor should be something low-risk to them, appropriate for a short friendly exchange.  
- **Resolve Dispute** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Mediate an argument or conflict between individuals informally over up to an hour. Say two crew members are bickering about workload; in 10–60 minutes of being the voice of reason, you get them to calm down, see each other’s perspective, and perhaps shake hands. You’re not an official arbitrator (that might be Diplomacy), but you use personal appeal (“we’re all on the same team here, right?”) to find a middle ground. Persuade helps address the emotions involved and suggests a compromise both can live with.  
- **Ingratiate Yourself** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, build rapport and a friendly relationship with a person or group. This might be hanging out with starport dockworkers for an afternoon, buying them drinks and swapping stories. After 1–6 hours, they regard you as “one of the good folks” – not a close friend yet, but someone they like and would help out within reason. Essentially, you’ve used time and genuine interest (or at least the appearance of it) to win people over. This sets the stage for later requests or cooperation that would have been harder as a stranger.  
- **Change Opinion** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a day engaged in discussion and exposure to new ideas with someone to shift their stance on a significant issue. For example, you join a trader on a long road trip (4–24 hours) and through conversation, you gradually persuade them that an alliance with your crew would be lucrative, overcoming their earlier skepticism. Or you counsel a nervous colonial leader over multiple meetings in a day to convince her that evacuating the village is the best option, reversing her initial opposition. Such deep changes aren’t guaranteed – it’s an ongoing persuasion, perhaps requiring strong arguments (INT to provide logic) and personal appeals (SOC to address concerns). But if successful, the target comes out genuinely convinced, not just momentarily agreeable.  
- **Lead Persuasion Campaign** *(SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, influence a community or group subtly via rumors, casual talks, and showing by example. In 10–60 hours of effort (spreading across multiple days), you might try to sway the opinion of a ship’s crew about their captain, or a town’s populace about supporting a policy. This could involve chatting with many individuals (coffeehouse discussions, etc.), telling evocative anecdotes, and seeding ideas in public forums. It’s basically low-key propaganda or politicking on a small scale. A successful effort might shift the general attitude: for instance, the crew starts murmuring that maybe *your* plan is better than the captain’s, or the townsfolk begin to support the idea of trading with offworlders whereas before they were xenophobic. (Large-scale opinion change might also involve *Advocate* or *Diplomat* for formal speeches, but Persuade covers the grassroots chatting approach.)  
- **Rouse Populace** *(SOC, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days, with constant engagement, rally a group of ordinary people into action through persuasion. This might be rallying miners to go on strike or motivating a village to band together to clean up after a disaster. You spend days talking individually and in impromptu gatherings, addressing concerns and fueling enthusiasm or resolve. By the end, you’ve built enough momentum that the group takes collective action that they previously wouldn’t have. They may not be following a legal procedure (which would be Leadership or Diplomat) – they’re doing it because they personally feel convinced and fired up by your words. This is tricky (people might lose steam or get scared), but a good Persuade roll with enough time can create a minor movement.

## Pilot  
*Pilot* is for controlling spacecraft of various sizes. Specialties: Small Craft (under 100 tons, like shuttles or fighters), Spacecraft (100–5000 tons, typical merchant ships), and Capital Ships (over 5000 tons). It covers takeoff, maneuvering in space, docking, and atmospheric entry of starships.

- **Evasive Thrusters** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In a one-second burst of instinctive action, jink a spacecraft slightly to throw off an enemy’s aim or avoid a bit of debris. In personal combat terms it’s like a dodge, but for a ship. In practice, Traveller space combat rounds are longer, but this could be an “instant” reaction within a round that gives a slight edge. A skilled Pilot might convince the GM to allow a quick opposed check to avoid something like a surprise torpedo in that split-second.  
- **Micro-adjust Course** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Over a few seconds, input a precise series of thruster bursts to adjust orientation or trajectory slightly. For example, during docking, you spend 6–36 seconds to align exactly with the airlock. Or when flying in formation, you fine-tune your position relative to the lead ship. This is a minor action that prevents larger errors later. It’s essentially fine control that a novice pilot might take much longer to accomplish or not bother with, but an expert does constantly.  
- **Systems Check Drill** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to run through a rapid version of a pre-flight or in-flight systems check. Perhaps something feels off, so in 10–60 seconds you scan your console, eyeball gauges, and maybe do a quick control test (like wiggle the ship a bit) to ensure all major systems (engines, controls, life support) are nominal. A good Pilot can do this kind of sweep very fast, catching issues that autopilot might not alert yet. This can be done while taxiing to a launch pad or just after a sudden event (like after taking a hit, you quickly assess damage status).  
- **Launch/Land Routine** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Execute a standard takeoff or landing from a starport or carrier in a few minutes. You follow procedure: warming engines, obtaining clearance, gentle lift or descent, and final touchdown. 1–6 minutes is typical from starting motion to being in the air/space or vice versa (small craft might even be quicker). With skill, you handle crosswinds or turbulence calmly. Non-skilled pilots might stretch this out or have rougher landings.  
- **Navigate Hazard Field** *(DEX, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend 10–60 minutes piloting through a hazardous area where each moment requires attention. Classic example: weaving through an asteroid field or a debris cloud. Or flying at low altitude through canyons on a planet. This isn’t a quick dodge – it’s sustained tricky flying. Over that time, your *Pilot* skill avoids collisions. The GM might call for a check for each significant segment (like every 10 minutes) or a single check for the whole ordeal; a skilled pilot ensures success and likely does it faster or with style.  
- **In-System Burn** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Over several hours (1–6 hours), pilot a ship on an in-system journey that involves long acceleration and deceleration phases. For instance, traveling from a planet to its moon or to a jump point far from the gravity well. Much of this is on autopilot, but *Pilot* skill is used to plot an efficient thrust profile, monitor engines, and adjust course as needed (like avoiding space traffic or an unexpected comet). A good pilot might shave time off the trip by optimizing the burn (reach destination a little sooner by pushing limits safely).  
- **Continuous Maneuvering** *(END/INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Handle the helm for a long stretch of continuous maneuvering, perhaps during a prolonged chase or patrol. For 4–24 hours, you might be on standby to dodge at any sign of trouble (e.g., zigzagging through a nebula to avoid being tracked). This tests endurance – you can’t fully relax the whole time. Pilot skill helps you stay focused by falling into a rhythm and using little tricks (like letting the gyros handle minor corrections) so you’re not overtaxed.  
- **Emergency Deceleration** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a day or two (10–60 hours), perform an unusual piloting feat such as decelerating from high speed in an emergency without frying the ship. Perhaps a misjump dropped you near a planet and you have to do a high-g burn for 20 hours to avoid crashing. You manage heat dissipation, hull stress, and engine output with careful skill, making constant small adjustments. By the end, the ship survives an ordeal that might normally tear less-managed vessels apart. (This overlaps with Engineer monitoring drives, but Pilot is handling the flight profile itself.)  
- **Blockade Run** *(INT/DEX, 1D days)* – Over several days, pilot your ship in a system under pursuit or threat, using stealth and clever course plotting to avoid superior forces. For 1–6 days, you execute a plan: hiding behind moons, making sudden vector changes, coasting with engines off at times (for stealth), etc. Each “day” might have critical moments (like a near-detection where a quick pilot roll evades scanning). At the end, if successful, you slip through the blockade. This is an advanced application of *Pilot* requiring strategic planning (with maybe Tactics for space) and flawless execution of multiple small maneuvers over a long period.

## Physical Sciences  
*Physical Sciences* is a Science skill grouping focusing on non-living systems. Specialties include Physics, Chemistry, Electronics (as a science), and possibly others like geology depending on setting. It’s about understanding the physical laws and properties of matter and energy.

- **Estimate Trajectory** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly estimate a simple physical trajectory or outcome. In a second or two, a physicist-minded character might gauge that a thrown object will fall short, or that a particular ledge will hold weight due to center-of-mass considerations. It’s not precise calculation, just intuition built from physics knowledge (e.g., “That bridge can’t support the grav-truck’s weight at the current angle – it’ll tip now!”, shouted just in time).  
- **Identify Substance Quickly** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a half-minute or less, recognize a material or chemical by simple observation or a quick field test. For example, you sniff or look at the burn of a sample and say, “This is magnesium alloy” or “That crystal is likely potassium nitrate.” This is using chemical knowledge on the fly – sometimes combined with a quick flame or scratch test you can do in seconds.  
- **Mental Math & Formula** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to perform a calculation or recall a formula relevant to a situation. Maybe computing how long before a disabled ship hits atmosphere (based on orbital mechanics), or figuring out the yield of an explosive given its composition mass (a chemistry calc). In 10–60 seconds, you’ve done the math or dredged up the equation from memory. This can give you a rough answer which can inform decisions (“We have 30 minutes until re-entry!”).  
- **Set Up Experiment** *(DEX/INT, 1D minutes)* – In a few minutes, set up a simple experiment or piece of scientific equipment properly. For example, aligning a portable telescope and calibrating it to local gravity, or assembling a makeshift circuit to test electrical conductivity of a sample. In 1–6 minutes, thanks to science training, you ensure the apparatus is correctly configured so results will be valid.  
- **Conduct Lab Test** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over tens of minutes (10–60) perform a controlled test of something. For instance, run a chemical titration to determine pH, use a spectrometer on a mineral, or test the resistance of an unknown wire. At the end of that period, you have specific data (composition revealed, property measured, etc.). *Physical Sciences* skill ensures you interpret that data right: “This ore contains 20% lanthanum” or “The circuit can handle up to 5kW before failing.”  
- **Analyze Data** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours analyzing collected data or solving a complex equation. Maybe you have hours of sensor readings of a star’s output – you crunch it to find patterns or periodicity. Or you solve a multi-variable physics equation needed to calibrate a jump drive component. In 1–6 hours, you pore over numbers (perhaps with a computer’s help, but your skill guides the analysis) and come out with a conclusion or the answer you were seeking.  
- **Develop Hypothesis (Physical)** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, consider a physical phenomenon and formulate a hypothesis or theoretical model for it. Example: The ship’s engines are experiencing an ineffable jitter every time we pass near a certain planet. You spend 4–24 hours reviewing physics principles and maybe doing small calculations to propose, “Perhaps the planet’s magnetosphere is resonating with our drive field; if we adjust frequency, it might stop.” Essentially, you craft an explanation that can be tested. *Physical Sciences* skill draws on your deep knowledge to synthesize known principles into this new context.  
- **Build Prototype Device** *(DEX/EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, design and construct a prototype of a physical device or experiment rig. Suppose you theorize a new sensor that can detect cloak fields using quantum vibrations. In 10–60 hours, using lab tools and parts, you assemble a prototype according to physical laws. This involves a lot of trial, error, and fine-tuning. Success would yield a working (if clunky) device demonstrating the concept, or at least a partial success that provides insight. This uses physics/electronics knowledge heavily, and perhaps *Engineer/Mechanic* for the building part, but you (with Physical Sciences skill) are the brain behind the design.  
- **Major Research Project** *(EDU, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days, undertake a full-blown research project in physical sciences. Maybe you want to determine the properties of a newly discovered element from a meteor. Over those days, you run multiple experiments: melting point, spectral analysis, conductivity tests, etc., all carefully planned. Or you try to verify a theoretical prediction like creating a mini wormhole in a lab (very ambitious!). Each day, you interpret results and adjust the approach. At the end, you compile a comprehensive report. In-game, this could either simply produce the information needed (if it was more routine analysis) or be the subject of an adventure itself (dealing with unforeseen effects of your experiments, etc.). A solid Physical Sciences skill ensures you get useful, accurate results from the project rather than misleading noise.

## Recon  
*Recon* is the art of scouting, spotting dangers, and noticing unusual things. It’s about being alert to ambushes, traps, or anything out of place in an environment.

- **Glance for Threats** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – In a single second, sweep your eyes around and catch any immediately obvious threats. This is that quick gut-check when entering a room or clearing a corridor. A recon-savvy character might automatically notice a gunman in an unexpected corner or the glint of a sniper scope on a ridge as soon as it’s in view. It’s essentially an almost reflexive perception, often what triggers an initiative roll or a chance to avoid surprise in game terms.  
- **Listen Carefully** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Pause for a few seconds (up to ~half a minute) to listen for any subtle sounds. Perhaps you hold up a fist to signal the team to stop moving, then strain to hear. With Recon, you might pick out the faint clink of an armor plate down the hallway or the crunch of leaves that suggests someone moving in the brush. This action can prevent walking into someone unawares.  
- **Peek and Scan** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to peek out from cover or scan a small area without being seen yourself. For example, you slowly inch a mirror or scope around a corner to see what’s there, or you crawl up a ridge to get eyes on a clearing, spending 10–60 seconds observing. Recon skill helps you do this stealthily and notice key details quickly (like number of enemies, positions, or an unexpected tripwire across the entry).  
- **Search Person/Container** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes to thoroughly search a person (patting down) or a container/room for hidden items. In 1–6 minutes, you go beyond the quick frisk, checking linings, feeling for hidden pockets, or tapping for hollow spaces. Recon trained characters often find the holdout pistol in a boot or the secret compartment in a suitcase. This overlaps with Investigate, but Recon is more about immediate physical search technique especially for danger (like “Does this prisoner have a knife on them? Let me double-check”).  
- **Scout Perimeter** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over up to an hour, scout the perimeter of a campsite, base, or building to ensure it’s safe. In 10–60 minutes you walk the perimeter, look for footprints, recent disturbances, or hidden observation posts. You might also identify good hiding spots or approach paths that intruders might use. By the end, you have a reasonable assurance that area is clear (or you’ve discovered signs it isn’t). This is typically done before settling in to camp or when guarding a temporary HQ.  
- **Stakeout** *(END, 1D hours)* – Remain hidden and observe a location continuously for several hours. For 1–6 hours, you might sit in a parked grav-car outside a warehouse or lie camouflaged on a hillside watching a valley. Recon helps you stay vigilant (and awake) the whole time and notice patterns or the specific event you’re waiting for (e.g., the target arriving). You also know how to avoid detection during this period – rotating observation spots slightly, etc.  
- **Shadow Target** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Follow a person or vehicle discreetly over a half-day. For 4–24 hours, you tail them through changing environments – perhaps through a city into a wilderness rendezvous. Recon skill is used to maintain visual on the target while using cover/crowds to not be seen. You also predict their moves (“He’s heading to the spaceport – likely to the long-term parking”). This is an extended opposed contest (Recon vs. target’s Recon or Stealth usually) where you must be consistently good; the timeframe suggests at least a few checks may be involved.  
- **Explore Unknown Area** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, systematically scout a larger area (like several square kilometers of jungle or a section of- **Explore Unknown Area** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Spend a couple of days (10–60 hours) systematically scouting a large region. For example, mapping several square kilometers of jungle or surveying a valley for threats. You break the area into sections and comb through each, using vantage points to glass with binoculars and marking safe paths. By the end, you have a thorough mental (or drawn) map of the terrain, locations of resources or hazards, and likely movement routes. This extended recon can discover hidden enemy camps or find the easiest route for an army to march through.  
- **Combing a City** *(INT, 1D days)* – Conduct a large-scale search for a person or clue across an urban area. Over 1–6 days, you divide the city into grids, check known hangouts, talk to contacts, and watch key locations. Recon skill helps you notice subtle signs in crowds or patterns in neighborhoods. This could flush out a fugitive (you spot graffiti tags or rumors of sightings) or recover a lost item (“someone pawned a ring matching the description”). It’s an exhaustive process, but you cover every corner methodically, leaving little unchecked.

## Remote Operations  
*Remote Operations* is controlling drones, robots, or remote vehicles via telepresence. It requires coordinating sensors and controls from afar as if you were on-site.

- **Switch Control** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Instantly take direct manual control of a drone or remote system. In one second, you flip from automated mode to manual, or jump between drone camera feeds. A skilled remote operator can do this fluidly, maintaining situational awareness across multiple remotes almost instantly (e.g., switching to a security camera that just detected motion).  
- **Jink a Drone** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Perform an evasive maneuver with a remote drone in a short burst. If a surveillance drone comes under fire, you can, within a few seconds, send it zigzagging or ducking behind cover. This quick response can be the difference between a drone being shot down or surviving. It’s akin to a Pilot evasion but done remotely with maybe a slight control lag that you expertly compensate for.  
- **Sensor Realignment** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute adjusting a remote’s sensors or settings to adapt to new conditions. For example, you notice your recon drone’s thermal vision isn’t picking up something, so in 10–60 seconds you recalibrate its imaging for the current environment (fiddling with contrast, switching to motion-detection mode). This ensures the remote continues to feed you the most useful data.  
- **Operate Drone Arm** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Use a robot’s manipulator or a remote arm to perform a delicate task in a few minutes. In 1–6 minutes, you might have a bomb-disposal robot clipping the correct wire or a remote surgical unit performing a quick procedure. The Remote Ops skill translates your human finesse into machine movement, overcoming any latency or mechanical stiffness. By the end, the task is done almost as if a person with the right skill had done it on site.  
- **Recon via Drone** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Guide a surveillance drone over a wide area for up to an hour to scout and gather intel. You pilot the drone to key points, adjust cameras, perhaps even drop listening devices. Over 10–60 minutes, you effectively canvas a location remotely, using the drone’s vantage to note guard positions, terrain, or points of interest. Remote Ops skill means you don’t crash the drone or miss angles; you utilize its capabilities (zoom, infrared) fully.  
- **Remote Piloting Session** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Control a remote vehicle or robot for several hours of continuous operation. For instance, remotely driving a rover on a hazardous planet surface for 1–6 hours to map it. You handle terrain, respond to sensor readings, and perhaps manage the vehicle’s power levels. It’s tiring to concentrate remotely that long, but your skill allows you to almost “feel” the remote as an extension of yourself, reducing mistakes over the long haul.  
- **Long-Distance Coordination** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, coordinate multiple remotes or a complex remote operation. Picture controlling a team of mining drones on an asteroid: one drilling, one hauling, one surveying, for 4–24 hours. You rotate between them, issue queued commands, and handle any conflicts (like avoiding collisions or power drain). By the end of the shift, the drones have achieved a large task collectively (extracted a vein of ore, for example) under your guidance.  
- **Surveillance Network** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days (10–60 hours), set up and manage a persistent network of remote sensors or cameras. You might seed an area with tiny drone sensors, then monitor their feeds continuously (with some sleep breaks). Remote Ops skill lets you program automated routines and alerts so you’re efficiently using your time. After this period, you have a thorough recording or understanding of all movements in the area, as your network caught everything and you interpreted it correctly.  
- **Telepresence Mission** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – For 1–6 days, carry out a complex mission entirely via remote presence. Say an exploration of a deadly derelict ship: you send in robotic explorers and conduct the whole survey from your console. Over several days you face varied challenges – mechanical doors to cut through, computer terminals to hack (via remote, possibly using *Computers*), hostile robots to outmaneuver – all through your remotes. Remote Operations skill keeps your “digital hands” steady throughout. By mission’s end, you accomplished objectives with zero personal risk, though your mental fatigue might be significant. (This showcases using Remote Ops in extended story arcs, coordinating with other skills as needed.)

## Seafarer  
*Seafarer* covers operating watercraft of all kinds. Specialties: Sail, Motorboat, Ocean Ships (large vessels), and Submarine. It’s for navigation and piloting on or under water.

- **Trim Sails** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In an instant, adjust rigging or sail angle in response to a sudden gust. Experienced sailors can, in 1–6 seconds, haul a line or ease a sheet just enough to prevent capsizing or to catch better wind. This quick reaction keeps a sailing vessel stable and efficient.  
- **Minor Course Correction** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Over a few seconds, turn the wheel or rudder slightly to avoid a piece of flotsam or a shallow spot. For motorboats or subs, this could be a slight dive or rise to dodge debris. It’s a small adjustment made in one or two boat-lengths of travel, preventing a collision or grounding without significantly altering the journey.  
- **Depth Adjustment** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – For submarines or submersibles: in under a minute, change depth to avoid detection or obstacle. For example, you hear a sonar ping and within 10–60 seconds you’ve taken the sub 50 meters deeper into a thermal layer where sonar is less effective. Seafarer skill (submarine specialty) ensures you don’t breach safe operating limits while doing this quickly.  
- **Dock or Cast Off** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – In a few minutes, either bring a vessel into dock or depart one. Docking might involve reversing engines, tossing lines to shore, and using thrusters or oars to ease in (1–6 minutes of careful maneuver). Casting off means loosening moorings, coordinating with harbor control, and navigating out of the berth. *Seafarer* skill ensures neither process damages the vessel or pier, even in a tight harbor.  
- **Navigate Shoals** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour piloting through tricky waters like reefs, sandbanks, or ice floes. You consult charts (if available) and proceed slowly, using depth sounders or a lookout. In 10–60 minutes, you traverse the hazardous area successfully. Mistakes could beach the ship, but a skilled mariner picks the correct channel (reading the color of water, wave patterns) and gets through without a scrape.  
- **Open-Water Voyage** *(END, 1D hours)* – Steer or oversee a medium-duration journey (1–6 hours) across open water. This is like a “shift” at the helm of an ocean ship or several hours of sailing on a lake. You keep the vessel on course, deal with any minor changes in weather, and maintain speed. Seafarer skill here is about endurance and steadiness – holding a consistent bearing by the stars or compass, trimming as winds change, and spotting distant hazards (like a floating log) in time to avoid them.  
- **Extended Patrol** *(END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, operate a boat or sub continuously on patrol or search duty. 4–24 hours of scanning the horizon, running search patterns, and staying alert for anything unusual. Fatigue can be an issue, but a good seafarer rotates small tasks (a bit of navigation check here, an engine room peek there) to stay fresh and keeps the crew engaged. By the end, you’ve covered a huge area methodically (e.g., a grid search for a shipwreck or survivor) with minimal gaps.  
- **Oversea Navigation** *(EDU/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Plot and execute a long sea voyage over a day or two. In 10–60 hours of travel time (with rests), you navigate from one port to another far away, possibly out of sight of land. *Seafarer* skill means knowing ocean currents, weather patterns, and using sextant or GPS to stay on course. A journey that might take a novice dangerously off course, you complete on schedule. (If using 18th-century tech, you’d be doing dead reckoning and celestial nav calculations each day – skill ensures accuracy).  
- **Survive Storm at Sea** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – For 1–6 days, guide a vessel through a severe storm or series of squalls. This is a marathon of seamanship: you trim sails to bare minimum or manage engines carefully, keep the bow into the waves, mend any storm damage on the fly, and reassure crew. Each day may bring new challenges (rogue wave, equipment failure, navigation drift). With high *Seafarer* skill, you make the best decisions (e.g., when to run before the storm vs. hold position) and emerge with ship and crew intact, where lesser sailors might have sunk. It’s an extreme test that could be the centerpiece of an adventure at sea.

## Sensors  
*Sensors* is the skill for using and interpreting data from electronic sensor systems – radar, lidar, sonar, thermal imagers, densitometers, etc., often found on starships and vehicles.

- **Quick Scan** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Take an instantaneous reading from sensors for immediate info. In a second or two, you glance at the scope and catch a blip’s range and bearing. For example, checking the radar and instantly noting “Contact at 2 o’clock, 5 km out”. This is often enough to alert the crew or take action without a full sensor analysis.  
- **Active Ping** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Initiate an active sensor ping (like a radar sweep or sonar ping) and get the return within a few seconds. In 6–36 seconds, you send out a pulse and listen for echoes. Sensors skill ensures you tune the frequency appropriate to the environment (e.g., adjusting sonar frequency in shallow water to reduce clutter). At the end, you have updated positions for targets around you – though you may also reveal your presence.  
- **Fine-Tune Sensor** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute adjusting sensor settings to focus on a specific detail. For instance, narrow the scan cone to zoom in on one asteroid among many or recalibrate a thermal imager to filter out background heat. In 10–60 seconds, you’ve optimized the device, turning a vague signal into a clearer reading. This might be done right before a critical scan (like homing in on the faint power signature of a cloaked ship).  
- **Lock Target Signature** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to thoroughly scan a target and lock onto its sensor signature. In 1–6 minutes, you run multiple sensor modes (visual, IR, radar) on a single target (like a starship or aircraft) to build a comprehensive profile. After this, you can recognize that target again easily (fingerprinting its engine emissions or radar return) and perhaps guide weapons with a bonus because you know exactly what to home in on.  
- **Wide-Area Sweep** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour doing a systematic sensor sweep of a large area. For example, circling a star system with deep scanners active to find hidden objects, or combing a battlefield’s vicinity for camouflaged units. You partition the area and scan segment by segment, interpreting lots of data. After 10–60 minutes, you have either found points of interest or can confidently say the area is clear of anything above a certain sensor threshold. Sensor skill is key to distinguishing actual contacts from noise or false echoes during this process.  
- **Analyze Readings** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, analyze recorded sensor data for patterns or specific intel. Perhaps you have hours of spectrographic readings of a nebula or long-term surveillance data from a sensor array. In 1–6 hours, you filter and cross-correlate the data (maybe with computer assistance) to draw conclusions: “These energy spikes repeat every 88 minutes – likely an orbiting stealth probe.” Your knowledge of sensors helps avoid misinterpreting anomalies.  
- **Calibrate Array** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend a half-day recalibrating a complex sensor array for peak performance. Over 4–24 hours, you run diagnostics on every element (each radar emitter, each telescopic lens), realign antenna dishes, update the sensor software’s baseline. After this, the system’s sensitivity improves (mechanically, perhaps grants +1 DM on future sensor checks until it drifts again). This is often done before a big exploration mission or after the array suffered stress (like weapons fire nearby messing up alignments).  
- **Integrate Sensor Network** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days, link multiple sensors into a cohesive network and tweak them to complement each other. For example, on a colony world, set up a perimeter of seismic sensors, motion detectors, and cameras and make them feed into one system. In 10–60 hours you handle wiring/wireless linking, adjust each unit’s range to cover gaps, and program the central system to cross-check (so a false alarm on one sensor type can be caught by another). The result is a sensor net far more effective than its parts, with minimal blind spots or false alarms.  
- **Long-Term Monitoring** *(INT/END, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days, continuously monitor sensors for a specific event or target. Perhaps you’re on a picket ship watching for any incursions at a jump point, or operating a deep-scan ground telescope for signs of an approaching comet. This requires patience and focus; you might be in a rotation or using automated alerts (but you need to verify any hits). Sensor skill ensures you don’t succumb to alert fatigue – you keep the system tuned and catch the faint event when it finally occurs (“After five days of nothing, there – a hyperfootprint on the edge of the system!”).

## Social Sciences  
*Social Sciences* encompasses study of sophont societies and cultures. Specialties include Archaeology, Economics, History, Linguistics, Philosophy, Psychology, and Sophontology (study of intelligent species). It’s about understanding how beings think and societies function.

- **Recall Historical Fact** *(EDU, 1D seconds)* – Instantly remember a relevant detail from history or social knowledge. In a second or two, a historian recalls the date of a famous treaty when asked, or a psychologist remembers the term for a behavior they’re observing. This quick recall can provide context (“This planet’s civil war mirrors the 2nd Ilonian conflict in 300–303, which was resolved by outside mediation”).  
- **Spot Cultural Sign** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a half a minute or less, notice and interpret a cultural marker. Perhaps you see a street tattoo or hand gesture and realize it’s a gang sign in that society, or you hear two Vargr using a particularly formal tone and infer they’re of a certain clan. Social Science (sophontology or linguistics) helps recognize these cues. It allows quick adjustments to avoid faux pas or to identify who’s who socially.  
- **Economic Guess** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – From a snippet of information or a brief look around, estimate an economic fact within under a minute. For example, glancing at a marketplace for 10–60 seconds, an economist might guess the supply shortage (few vendors selling a common good means scarcity). Or hearing one stock price, you infer how the sector’s performing. It’s an educated guess, not exact, but can inform bargaining or planning (“Grain is expensive here – likely a recent crop failure”).  
- **Sociological Observation** *(INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes observing social interactions or conditions to draw a conclusion. In 1–6 minutes of watching a crowd or listening to locals, you might notice class divisions (who gives orders vs. who carries them out), general morale, or tension in the air. Psychology or sociology knowledge lets you pick up mood and group dynamics. For instance, you might conclude “These workers are on edge – likely one spark away from a strike or riot.”  
- **Decode Inscription** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Take up to an hour to interpret an ancient text or unfamiliar language sample. Using Archaeology or Linguistics, in 10–60 minutes you analyze patterns or compare to known tongues to extract meaning. You might decipher a ruin’s carvings to find it’s a warning of plague, or decode a data chip in an old dialect. It’s not a full translation, but you get the gist and key details – enough to act on.  
- **Catalog Findings** *(EDU, 1D hours)* – Over several hours, systematically catalog or record social science data. An archaeologist might document every artifact in a dig site grid for 1–6 hours, or a sociologist might compile survey results. It’s painstaking but yields a clear dataset. By the end, you have a well-organized body of knowledge (e.g., a map of an ancient city’s layout from artifact distribution, or a demographic breakdown of a town’s survey responses). This is often followed by analysis (perhaps another task) but is crucial groundwork.  
- **Policy Analysis** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day analyzing an institution or policy’s effects. An economist might take 4–24 hours with trade and tax data to determine why a colony’s economy is faltering. A political scientist (one could consider under Philosophy or Sophontology perhaps) might study a planetary government’s structure to predict its stability. After this analysis, you can advise precisely (“A luxury tax is crippling local entrepreneurs – removing it should boost growth” or “This empire will likely fragment into feuding houses after the emperor’s death unless a strong successor is named”).  
- **Cross-Cultural Mediation** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a few days, use your understanding of cultures to mediate or bridge between them. For 10–60 hours, you perhaps live among an alien tribe to learn their ways and teach them about offworld customs, acting as an intermediary. Or you serve on a diplomatic team translating not just language but concept (explaining each side’s cultural assumptions to the other). Your Social Sciences skill ensures misunderstandings are minimized. By the end, mutual understanding is significantly improved – a crucial step for forming alliances or trade agreements.  
- **Anthropological Fieldwork** *(END/EDU, 1D days)* – Conduct in-depth field research on a society over 1–6 days (or longer, but capped here). You immerse yourself: interviewing inhabitants, observing rituals, partaking in daily life. It’s exhausting (especially if environment or customs are challenging), hence END. But at the end you compile a substantial ethnography: their social structure, beliefs, conflict points, etc. In game, this could mean you basically “figure out” the local culture’s secrets or at least earn their trust. A successful fieldwork might yield a +DM to all future social interactions because you truly understand them now.

## Space Sciences  
*Space Sciences* deals with astrophysics and other space phenomena. Specialties include Planetology, Robotics (in some contexts), Xenology (study of alien life’s science aspects, distinct from Sophontology). It covers knowledge of planets, stars, cosmology, and applied sciences for space.

- **Identify Star Type** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly recognize the class of a star or type of celestial object at a glance. In a second, a space scientist looks at the color and size of a star in the sky and says “Class M red dwarf” or sees a nebula and notes “That’s a supernova remnant.” This quick ID can inform decisions (like what radiation to expect or if a planet in that system might be habitable).  
- **Observe Orbit Pattern** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Spend a few moments (under half a minute) tracking the motion of celestial bodies or ships and discern a pattern. For example, after 6–36 seconds watching a moon’s movement relative to its planet, you intuit whether it’s prograde or retrograde orbit. Or noting the interval of a comet’s tail changes, you guess its rotation period. This might not give full data, but enough to anticipate timing (“We have a two-hour window before that asteroid occludes the sun again”).  
- **Calculate Trajectory** *(EDU, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, perform a rough orbital or trajectory calculation in your head or with a handheld computer. Perhaps calculating how long until an object falls out of orbit, or the delta-V needed to transfer from one orbit to another around this planet. In 10–60 sec, you scribble formulas or use an app, yielding a quick-and-dirty result like “We’ll intercept that derelict in 3 orbits (about 5 hours).” This overlaps with Astrogation but for local space physics, a Space Science (planetology/physics) person can do it too.  
- **Telescope Targeting** *(DEX/INT, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to aim and focus a space telescope or sensor array on a specific cosmic target. In 1–6 minutes, you align on a faint star or distant planet, accounting for relative motion. A specialist ensures the calibration is spot-on, so the image/data is clear. Useful for spotting incoming vessels at long range or studying a newly found comet – anything where pointing precision matters.  
- **Analyze Atmosphere** *(EDU, 1D x 10 minutes)* – In up to an hour, use sensors or sample data to determine a planet’s atmospheric composition and conditions. For example, after 10–60 minutes analyzing spectrographic data, you conclude “Mostly nitrogen-oxygen with high argon content, trace chlorine – breathable but irritant present.” Or you examine soil and weather patterns to predict storm frequency. This helps decide if environment suits your needs or what gear you should don.  
- **Map Planetary Features** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours processing orbital scan data to map a planet’s surface or geological features. In 1–6 hours, perhaps using a survey satellite’s readings, you identify continents, mineral-rich areas, cave networks, or deposits of water-ice. This is planetology in action. At the end, you have a preliminary map and locations of interest (for mining or exploration).  
- **Simulate Phenomenon** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, run a simulation or theoretical model of a space phenomenon. Maybe you model two asteroids’ collision and fragmentation, or simulate climate changes if a planet’s orbit shifts slightly. In 4–24 hours on a computer, you input physics parameters and interpret results. Space Science skill ensures the simulation’s settings are realistic. The outcome might guide decisions (“If we knock this asteroid off course, our sim shows a 95% chance it won’t hit the colony over the next century”).  
- **Robotics Design** *(EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – (If Robotics is included under Space Science) Over a few days, design a robot for a specific space task. In 10–60 hours, you create schematics for a probe or rover to operate in a harsh environment (like a high-radiation world or a gas giant’s atmosphere). You consider materials, power supply, AI programming needs. At the end, you have blueprints ready for an Engineer to build. This demonstrates applying scientific knowledge to practical exploration tools.  
- **Chart System Anomalies** *(INT, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days, perform a detailed survey of a star system’s anomalies (gravity waves, wormhole traces, alien megastructures, etc.). You place sensor beacons, collect data at different points of the orbit, and then analyze it with complex physics. By the end, you’ve mapped out the anomaly (e.g., a hidden jump point, or the extent of a dark matter cloud) with high precision. This information could be crucial for navigation or scientific discovery, and only thorough, time-consuming research reveals it.

## Stealth  
*Stealth* is about staying unseen and unheard. It includes hiding, moving silently, and avoiding detection by observers or sensors.

- **Freeze Movement** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Instantly go motionless to avoid detection. In a second or two, you stop breathing heavily, halt mid-step, and blend with cover. Say a guard suddenly shines a light your way – you *freeze*. A skilled character can become nearly invisible if they were partially concealed already, since human eyes often notice movement first.  
- **Pick Pocket / Palm** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a brief moment (under half a minute), subtly filch a small item or slip something into a pocket without notice. This is the classic “bump and lift” or magician’s sleight of hand. You maneuver close within 6–36 seconds of casual interaction and complete the pickpocket. Stealth skill ensures your touch and timing don’t draw attention (often opposed by the target’s Recon or just a static difficulty).  
- **Blend into Crowd** *(SOC, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to disappear into a crowd or busy environment. By adjusting your posture, clothing, and pace within 10–60 seconds, you make yourself nondescript. The tail who was following you loses sight because you suddenly look like everyone else. This might involve picking up a prop (newspaper, hat) or just sidling behind people at the right moment.  
- **Shadow Cover to Cover** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes moving from one hiding spot to another under observation, without being seen. In 1–6 minutes, you patiently wait for the right moment (when the guard looks away or the camera rotates) and then glide to the next pillar/crate/shadow. Stealth skill helps you judge timing and remain low and quiet. This is common in infiltrations – slowly leapfrogging between safe points across a patrolled area.  
- **Infiltrate Area** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Take up to an hour to infiltrate a secure area or building, bypassing patrol patterns and using whatever cover is available. Over 10–60 minutes, you perhaps climb a fence, crawl under windows, time your steps with loud machinery noise, etc., progressing deeper. Stealth combined with some Recon (to spot cameras) allows you to make steady progress. By the end, you’re inside the perimeter or building without having raised an alarm.  
- **Camouflage Setup** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours camouflaging yourself or an item in the environment. In 1–6 hours, you could cover a vehicle with netting and foliage, apply pattern paint to your armor, or dig a hidey-hole in the ground. Afterward, it’s extremely hard to spot by casual observation (opposed by others’ Recon). This is often done before a stakeout or ambush; you prepare a near-invisible sniper’s nest, for example.  
- **Evade Pursuit** *(END/DEX, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over a half-day, continuously use stealth to evade a group that’s actively searching for you. You utilize terrain, keep noise down, double-back on your trail, and perhaps lay false trails. For 4–24 hours, you’re on the run but unseen. This could represent hiding in the wilderness from a search party or staying in city alley shadows while corporate mercs hunt you. It’s tiring (hence END for long physical exertion and stress), but a master of stealth can essentially become a ghost for an entire day.  
- **Stakeout Concealment** *(END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Remain hidden in a single spot for a very long time, such as observing a target for a couple of days. For 10–60 hours you might be lying in a tiny crawlspace or perched in a ceiling alcove. You manage your bodily needs in silence (using bottles, etc.), shift position only when absolutely safe, and avoid making any noise. Stealth skill lets you endure this and not reveal yourself (you even sleep lightly if needed, waking at slightest disturbance). This is the classic ninja or special ops stakeout, waiting for the precise moment to strike or the intel to be gathered.  
- **Invisibility Routine** *(INT, 1D days)* – Across multiple days, move through a community or facility such that people never really notice you. Perhaps you’re undercover in a building – you tail employees, slip into meetings, use maintenance corridors – over 1–6 days without being identified as an intruder. You vary your times, leave no traces, and if someone does see you, you have a clipboard or a confident nod that causes them to dismiss you as legit. This extended stealth is partially social engineering and partially physical sneaking. At the end, you’ve gathered all the info or done what you needed, and the enemy still doesn’t know you were there.

## Steward  
*Steward* is about serving and caring for passengers, nobles, or high-class clients. It covers hospitality, etiquette, and personal service on ships or estates.

- **Prevent Spill / Catch Item** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – In a split second, react during service to prevent embarrassment. E.g., a guest knocks over a wine glass and you deftly catch it before it empties, or you steady a platter on a rough ship turbulence jolt so the sauce doesn’t splatter. A steward’s reflexes in such moments keep things “invisible” – the guest often doesn’t even realize something almost went wrong.  
- **Quiet Interjection** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, subtly advise or cue your employer or guest to avoid a faux pas. For instance, you lean in and whisper the correct form of address or remind a Baron to introduce his wife. Done within 6–36 seconds of noticing a potential social blunder, it saves face gracefully. The Steward skill ensures you communicate the message discreetly, without drawing others’ attention.  
- **Adjust Ambiance** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, make a quick adjustment to the environment for comfort. For example, noticing guests looking warm, you unobtrusively lower the thermostat or open a vent; if the lighting is harsh, you dim it slightly. In 10–60 seconds, possibly while everyone’s attention is elsewhere, you tweak things so that when they notice, it’s just *better*. A skilled steward anticipates needs and fixes them almost instantly.  
- **Gracious Greeting** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to greet new passengers or guests, making them feel welcome and informing them of essentials. In 1–6 minutes per guest/group, you learn their names (and titles, preferences), give a brief tour or overview (“Your cabins are this way; dinner at 1900 hours in the lounge”), and set a positive tone. Steward skill ensures you hit the right level of formality or friendliness, leaving an excellent first impression that can last the whole trip.  
- **Serve Meal Elegantly** *(DEX, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over the course of a meal (10–60 minutes), serve food and drink flawlessly to a group. You manage timing between courses, pour wine without spills, and respond to requests immediately. If an issue arises (a dish is too cold), you handle it so smoothly the guest hardly notices a delay. At the meal’s end, everyone feels well cared for. This action involves coordination and multitasking – high Steward skill keeps it all seamless.  
- **Manage Staff Shift** *(INT/SOC, 1D hours)* – Supervise a team of service staff (cabin attendants, waiters, housekeepers) for several hours, ensuring top-notch service throughout. For 1–6 hours (say, the duration of a gala or a routine morning on a luxury liner), you delegate tasks, quietly correct any missteps by junior staff, and fill in wherever extra help is needed. By the end, the guests’ experience was excellent, and any staffing hiccups were handled behind the scenes. Essentially, you’re the conductor of a service orchestra.  
- **Plan Event** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day organizing a special event (banquet, ball, etc.) for your patron. Over 4–24 hours, you arrange the venue, catering, entertainment, seating chart (being mindful of social dynamics), and contingency plans for anything that could go wrong. Steward skill means you know, for example, not to seat the Duke next to the CEO he hates, and to have a vegetarian option ready for the belter delegates. When the event occurs, because of your planning, it runs like clockwork.  
- **Personal Attendant Duty** *(END/SOC, 1D x 10 hours)* – Devote a couple of days exclusively to attending a high-maintenance individual’s needs. For 10–60 hours, you are effectively on-call 24/7 for a noble or celebrity: managing their wardrobe, screening their calls, preparing their favorite bath at exactly 7pm with the right oils, etc. It’s exhausting (END) keeping up with perhaps irregular hours and perfection demands. But a skilled steward anticipates the client’s whims, possibly earning their deep trust or a glowing recommendation by the end of the service period.  
- **Etiquette Training** *(SOC/EDU, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days, train a person or group in proper etiquette and protocol for an upcoming occasion. Maybe the crew has to attend a royal audience and they’re rough spacers – you drill them on bowing, forms of address, and dining manners. Or you teach a new hire the refined service techniques expected on a luxury starliner. By the end of training, thanks to your Steward guidance, the trainees can perform with confidence and avoid embarrassing mistakes. This might not directly serve a guest, but it extends your stewardship excellence through others.

## Streetwise  
*Streetwise* is understanding the urban underworld and navigating societal power structures informally. It’s used for finding black markets, avoiding police attention, and connecting with criminal or marginalized elements.

- **Recognize Gang Tag** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly identify a graffiti tag, hand sign, or slang as belonging to a certain gang or group. In a second or two, your street-honed instincts tell you “This alley is Triad turf” or “He flashed a sign for the Red Hawks.” This can warn you of danger or give you an opening by addressing them appropriately.  
- **Mingle Unnoticed** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – Within half a minute, adjust your posture and behavior to blend into a rough crowd without standing out. For 6–36 seconds you maybe muss your clothes, adopt the local slang accent, and slip into a group of dockworkers or bar patrons so that outsiders (like law enforcement or rival gangs) won’t pick you as an interloper. It’s like social camouflage on the fly.  
- **Quick Black Market Check** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, think of where in this settlement one could obtain illegal or scarce goods. With Streetwise, after 10–60 seconds consideration (or a brief scan of the area), you recall or deduce the likely location: “Weapons trade? Check the pawn shop on 3rd that’s a known front,” or “High-end electronics – the night market by the docks is your best bet.” It’s basically knowing the criminal layout from minimal info.  
- **Find Contact** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes in an area to locate a person who can help with underworld info or services. In 1–6 minutes of asking subtle questions and greasing palms (maybe a few credits or a cigarette), you track down a local fixer or a snitch. For example, you duck into a bar, chat up the bartender, and within minutes he nods you to “old Jax in the corner – he hears things.” Your Streetwise approach ensures you don’t come off as a cop or mark, so people are willing to point you in the right direction.  
- **Shake Tail** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over up to an hour, use urban tricks to lose someone following you. In 10–60 minutes through a city, you might change outfits from a stash, take a convoluted route through alleys and crowded bazaars, hop on and off vehicles, and maybe confront a known friendly gang to briefly block the pursuer. Streetwise is knowing which routes confound tails and where to hide. By the end, ideally the person tracking you is completely lost or chasing a wrong lead.  
- **Gather Rumors** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours carousing in low Company (bars, street corners, markets) to pick up useful rumors. In 1–6 hours of talking to cab drivers, beggars, petty criminals, and vendors, you piece together local gossip: which gang is on top, any big scores lately, where the heat (police) are focusing, etc. *Streetwise* skill helps filter out false drunken boasts from real intel. By the end, you have a decent picture of the underworld’s current state and possibly leads on whatever you’re interested in (“Heard some off-worlders are asking about cyber parts down in Scrapmarket – might be your guys”).  
- **Establish Black Market Deal** *(SOC, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, broker a clandestine deal for illegal goods or services. For 4–24 hours you meet intermediaries, negotiate terms, avoid traps or stings, and set up a safe exchange. For example, to buy contraband weapons, you might first meet a gang rep at a food stall at noon, then a supplier at a warehouse at dusk to inspect goods, and finally exchange money at midnight at a third location. Your Streetwise know-how ensures you aren’t cheated (you notice if the goods are low quality or if too many armed thugs are present) and that you have getaway options. At the end, the transaction is done discreetly.  
- **Organize Smuggling Route** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a couple of days, arrange a new smuggling path through a city or starport. In 10–60 hours, you find trustworthy couriers, map out safe houses or bribed officials, and schedule movements to avoid patrols. This is like creating a mini “underground railroad” for goods or people. Streetwise skill is critical for knowing whom to trust and how to incentivize them (cash, favors, mutual interest). When finished, you have a functioning route – e.g., you can now move contraband from the docks to the city’s uptown hidden in produce trucks whose drivers are on the take.  
- **Infiltrate Underworld** *(SOC/INT, 1D days)* – Over 1–6 days, fully integrate into the local underworld scene to the point where you can operate within it as one of their own. You gamble with gangsters, show respect to the right bosses, maybe do a small illicit job to prove yourself. Gradually, you’re treated as an insider. By the end of this period, you might secure an invite to a criminals’ gathering or get the ear of the crime lord because they think you’re a useful ally or at least not a threat. It’s essentially deep cover social work. Failing or succeeding depends on Streetwise savvy in adopting their customs and aligning with their unspoken code.

## Survival  
*Survival* is wilderness savvy – finding food, shelter, and staying alive in nature. It covers hunting, tracking, and environmental hazards for various terrains (desert, forest, etc.).

- **Reflex Dodge Hazard** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Immediately react to a sudden natural hazard. In a second or two, you might leap back from a snake strike, pull your foot away as the ground gives slightly over a covered pit, or swat a poisonous bug off your arm before it bites. This quick reflex often prevents damage (the GM might allow a Survival check to avoid a trap’s effects entirely if it’s nature-based).  
- **Grab the Right Tool** *(INT, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, recognize what survival tool or item is needed and grab it from your pack. For example, within 6–36 seconds of noticing the sky darken, you’ve fetched a tarp and started rigging a rain shelter. Or hearing a wild beast, you quickly ready your bear-spray or ultrasonic repeller. Survival skill means your kit is organized and your mind tuned to respond with the right gear for whatever nature throws.  
- **Identify Edible Resource** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – In under a minute, examine a plant, fungus, or water source and decide if it’s safe to consume. You might taste a tiny bit or observe animal bite marks. Within 10–60 seconds you conclude: “These berries are fine” or “Don’t drink this water without boiling – it’s stagnant (likely full of parasites).” This quick judgment can stave off hunger/thirst or avoid poisoning when you don’t have hours to test.  
- **Improvise Fire or Shelter** *(DEX/INT, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes to rig up basic shelter or get a small fire going in a pinch. In 1–6 minutes, using what’s on hand, you might arrange branches and a cloak into a lean-to or use a battery and steel wool to ignite tinder. It won’t be perfect, but it will keep rain off for the night or create enough warmth to prevent hypothermia. A skilled survivalist can do these tasks frighteningly fast, often practiced as drills.  
- **Hunt or Forage** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Take up to an hour to gather food in the wild. In 10–60 minutes, you set a few snares, collect edible plants, or catch some fish if near water. It isn’t an all-day hunt, but enough to supplement rations or feed a small group lightly. With good Survival, you focus on likely spots (tracks near a waterhole, berry bushes out of the wind) and come back with something to eat most of the time.  
- **Navigate Wilderness** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Over several hours (1–6), travel through unfamiliar wilderness without getting lost or walking into danger. You might be cutting through a dense jungle toward a mountain visible in distance. Using the sun/stars, natural signs (moss on trees, water flows downhill), you keep a steady course. Also, you choose safer routes (avoiding likely avalanche slopes or predator dens). This reduces travel mishaps and typically gets you where you intended to go by the end of the period.  
- **Set Camp (Safe)** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day securing a campsite for long-term safety and comfort. In 4–24 hours, you pick a defensible spot (downwind of a ridge to hide fire smoke, elevated from flood risk), build a substantial shelter (snow cave, log lean-to, or digging a trench and using a tarp), set up signals (arrange rocks in an SOS or calibrate a beacon), and perhaps lay traps or alarms for wildlife. A novice might just roll out a sleeping bag anywhere, but your preparation means the camp can sustain bad weather or nightly visits from critters.  
- **Track Over Days** *(INT/END, 1D x 10 hours)* – Follow the trail of an animal or person across difficult terrain for a couple of days. Over 10–60 hours (with rests), you read broken twigs, scat, footprints, etc., staying on the quarry’s path. Endurance matters as you might have to jog to make up time or go a long distance. By the end, you either catch up to them or determine where they ended up (perhaps you find where the tracks meet a road – clueing that they got on a vehicle). Survival skill ensures subtle signs aren’t missed even as days pass and tracks grow cold.  
- **Endure Elements** *(END, 1D days)* – Survive in extreme environment for 1–6 days through skill and grit. This could be a desert with minimal water, a frigid tundra without proper clothing, or a jungle teeming with disease and predators. Each day you use Survival know-how: find water by condensation traps, dig into snow for insulation, cover skin with mud to deter insects, make fire with almost no fuel, ration food, and maintain mental focus. A less skilled person might perish or suffer greatly, but you manage to pull through each day until rescue or until reaching safety. This encompasses many small tasks and clever tricks accumulated to beat nature’s onslaught.

## Tactics  
*Tactics* covers strategic thinking and coordination in combat at various scales. Specialties: Military Tactics (ground combat, squad to army level) and Naval Tactics (space fleet or large vessel combat).

- **Spot Ambush Set-Up** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Immediately notice a tactical red flag in the environment. In a second or two, your battle sense tingles: “This chokepoint is ideal for an ambush” or “No kids or elderly in this village square – they’ve been cleared out (a fight might be coming)”. While Recon notices physical signs, Tactics gives you the context of how those signs fit an enemy plan. This can trigger you to halt the squad or change route literally in the last instant, potentially avoiding a deadly trap.  
- **Issue Quick Order** *(SOC, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a single combat round (a few seconds), give a short command that coordinates your team’s immediate action. For example: “Suppressing fire on that ridge!” or “Fall back to the second trench now!” Delivered in 6–36 seconds, this instruction can grant your allies a tactical advantage for that round (perhaps a bonus or enabling a maneuver) because it’s the right order at the right time. It uses Tactics knowledge to choose the optimal immediate response to the fluid battlefield situation.  
- **Evaluate Enemy** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Spend under a minute observing an enemy force’s positions or behavior to gauge their strength and intentions. In 10–60 seconds of scanning the battlefield or reading a sensor display, you deduce things like: which enemy unit is the command element, where the weakest point in their line is, or what their next move will likely be (“They’re massing on our left – preparing a flanking charge”). This helps you adjust your plan accordingly.  
- **Coordinate Maneuver** *(SOC/INT, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes (during a lull or prior to engagement) to coordinate a multi-unit maneuver. In 1–6 minutes, you brief fireteam Alpha to lay cover fire while fireteam Beta circles around, or in space combat you instruct two ships to execute a pincer. Because of your tactical planning, the units move in harmony, supporting each other. Mechanically, this might set up a bonus when the plan is executed (“on my signal after 3 minutes, both squads breach from opposite doors”).  
- **Wargame Scenario** *(INT, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over an hour, analyze a battle scenario (real or hypothetical) to predict outcomes or find an optimal plan. You might use a map with tokens or a computer simulator. In 10–60 minutes you mentally play out “If we attack the hill, then enemy reserves… no, that’d fail unless we feint first.” By the end, you come up with a refined approach or at least know what **not** to do. In game, this could translate to a re-roll or bonus for the actual execution of the battle plan since you effectively practiced it.  
- **Lead Skirmish** *(SOC, 1D hours)* – Act as tactical commander during a skirmish or battle that lasts several hours (1–6 hours). You might be coordinating an extended defense of a base through multiple enemy waves, or orchestrating hit-and-run attacks throughout a day. Tactics skill means you rotate tired troops, probe enemy lines for soft spots, and time your decisive strike at the right moment. Over the battle’s course, your decisions consistently counter the enemy’s moves. If resolved narratively, at battle’s end your side holds the field with minimal losses because of your competent command (versus if they fought without guidance).  
- **Battlefield Fortification** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Spend half a day improving the defensive layout of a position using tactical insight. In 4–24 hours, you might reposition heavy weapons, lay mines in likely approach routes, dig dummy emplacements to mislead the enemy, and establish fields of overlapping fire. The result: if the enemy attacks, they’ll run into a killzone or wasted effort on false targets. This is more than just *Engineer* building things; it’s placing them in the most advantageous way tactically. The next battle at this location will go much better for the defenders due to this prep.  
- **Fleet Engagement Planning** *(INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, devise the strategy for a large-scale engagement (like a space fleet battle or major ground offensive). In 10–60 hours, you gather intel, consider logistics, position forces, and script the general battle plan: reserves here, main thrust there, contingency for retreat. This is likely done with staff help, maps, and simulation. When the battle unfolds, the plan serves as a blueprint; if your tactics were sound, your forces have interior lines, fire support pre-sighted, and clear objectives that exploit enemy weaknesses. (Of course, no plan survives contact entirely, but a good one gives huge initial advantage.)  
- **Execute Prolonged Campaign** *(END/INT, 1D days)* – Lead or coordinate a military campaign over 1–6 days of continuous operations. This could be a rapid war where each day is a new battle or maneuver. You need endurance and focus to adapt your strategy day by day, reacting to the enemy’s countermoves. Tactics skill lets you see the big picture throughout: you recognize when to press an advantage relentlessly and when to pull back and resupply. At campaign’s end, if successful, you’ve achieved strategic objectives (encircled the enemy, cut off their supply, forced a surrender, etc.). In game terms, this might be summarized by a series of Tactics rolls each day with evolving modifiers as situations change – your high skill increases the chance that each encounter in the campaign goes your way, culminating in overall victory.

## Trade  
*Trade* represents training in a practical trade or craft. Specialties vary widely (e.g., Trade (Biologicals), Trade (Hydroponics), Trade (Armorcraft), etc.), covering production of goods or services with professional skill.

- **Quality Check** *(INT, 1D seconds)* – Instantly inspect a crafted item or ongoing work for obvious flaws or quality. A craftsman’s eye in one second notices if a tool is improperly forged (a Smith sees hairline cracks in a blade) or if produce is fresh. This quick check lets you accept or reject materials on the fly, preventing waste or failure in your trade. For example, a Trade (Polymers) chemist might sniff a batch and immediately tell something’s off with the mixture.  
- **Tool Adjustment** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, adjust a tool or machine you’re working with to improve its performance mid-task. Maybe the lathe is chattering – you tighten a bolt or tweak speed within 6–36 seconds, then resume with better results. Or while cooking (Trade: Cook), you flick the stove from high to medium at just the right moment to avoid burning. It’s a small, swift fix that comes from knowing your tools intimately.  
- **Quick Fix / Improvise** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Use your trade knowledge to jury-rig a solution in under a minute when something goes wrong. If a weaver’s thread breaks, in 10–60 seconds you splice in a new one and apply wax so the flaw won’t show. If you’re a mechanic (Trade: Mechanics separate from Mechanic skill, perhaps focusing on fabrication), a bolt is missing – you find a nail or spare part and substitute it temporarily. Your quick improvisation keeps the workflow going or the product intact until a proper fix can be done.  
- **Serve Customer** *(SOC, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes delivering your trade service to a client’s satisfaction. For a Trade (Barber), that might be a quick trim and shave done nicely in 1–6 minutes, chatting just enough to keep them comfortable. For Trade (Merchant), it could be concluding a small sale at a stall with polite upsell and correct change. Trade skill ensures repeat business – you’ve shown professionalism even in a short interaction.  
- **Craft Item (Simple)** *(DEX, 1D x 10 minutes)* – In under an hour, create a simple but useful item related to your craft. A carpenter (Trade: Carpentry) might fashion a sturdy stool or tent stake in 10–60 minutes from spare wood. A Trade (Electronics) tech could solder together a basic circuit for an alarm in that time. The result is functional and safe. For more complex items you’d need more time, but a skilled tradesperson always has a few quick projects they can churn out, which can be handy (like making a splint or torch on the spot).  
- **Routine Work Shift** *(END, 1D hours)* – Put in a solid few hours of work at your trade, maintaining focus and quality throughout. A blacksmith (Trade: Blacksmith) might forge several nails, a couple of horseshoes, and a knife blade in 1–6 hours; a programmer (Trade: Programmer or similar) writes and debugs a few hundred lines of code in that span. Your expertise means fewer mistakes and steady progress – by the end of the shift you have a pile of finished goods or a completed task list without exhausting yourself prematurely.  
- **Major Project Phase** *(INT, 1D x 4 hours)* – Dedicate half a day to completing a significant phase of a larger project. For example, if building a small house (Trade: Construction), in 4–24 hours you and perhaps a couple assistants (if any) raise the frame and roof it. Or for Trade (Hydroponics), you set up an entire bank of growing lights and nutrient feeders in that time. You bring specialized knowledge to bear (“We must let the concrete set for 2 hours now or the foundation will crack, then proceed”) so the phase goes smoothly and sets up the next stage well.  
- **Design or Prototype** *(INT/EDU, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple of days, develop a new design or prototype in your field. A fashion designer (Trade: Tailor) might draft and sew a prototype dress in 10–60 hours, adjusting the pattern as they go. A Trade (Civil Engineering) expert might draft blueprints for a custom bridge over that period. This is creative and technical work combined. At the end, you have a working prototype or detailed plan that can be tested or reviewed. It might not be final, but it’s a tangible result of your expertise and likely impressively well-thought-out thanks to your training.  
- **Masterwork Project** *(DEX/INT, 1D days)* – Across 1–6 days (perhaps a week), create a high-quality item or complete a complex job that pushes your skill to the limit. For a weaponsmith, this could be forging a masterwork sword with intricate details; for a chef (Trade: Chef), preparing a grand banquet with dozens of courses from scratch. Throughout this period, you apply painstaking care and perhaps unique techniques you’ve picked up. By the end, the product is something special – potentially fetching a high price or becoming renowned. (Mechanically, this might grant a bonus to value or effectiveness of the item, like a crafted tool giving +1 to related tasks because it’s so well made.)

## Vacc Suit  
*Vacc Suit* is skill in operating and moving in spacesuits or any sealed environment suit. It’s crucial for zero-G work, EVA, and hostile environment survival.

- **Seal Breach** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – React immediately to a suit breach alarm by sealing it. In a second or two, you slap a patch or engage the emergency plug on a puncture. Maybe a micrometeorite punctured your thigh plate – a quick slap with the insta-seal gel stops the leak almost as soon as it started. This prevents dangerous air loss. A trained suit wearer often has muscle memory for where their patch kit is and how to apply it fast.  
- **Stabilize in Zero-G** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, stop an uncontrolled tumble or drift while in a vacc suit. Using your suit’s thrusters or grabbing a handhold, you counter the spin within 6–36 seconds. Novices in zero-G might spin wildly if they kick off wrong; you, with Zero-G training and Vacc Suit skill, regain control almost immediately, avoiding disorientation or collision with walls.  
- **Check Systems** *(INT, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Take under a minute to run a quick status check of suit systems by feel and instrument. In 10–60 seconds, you verify air mix, pressure, power levels, and tool functionality. This is often done right before a critical operation (“Tools go – magboots go – tether secure”) to catch anything amiss. Vacc Suit skill lets you do this rapidly and catch subtle issues (like a slightly failing CO2 scrubber) that others might miss until it’s a problem.  
- **Maneuver EVA** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Spend a few minutes executing a complex EVA maneuver. In 1–6 minutes, maybe you leap between two rotating sections of a ship or traverse a long gap using a suit thruster pack and then land on a narrow platform. With Vacc Suit proficiency, you account for momentum and timing, accomplishing the move gracefully. (This is like short-term “pilot your own body in space” use.) If someone without skill tried this, they might float off or slam too hard; you stick the landing.  
- **Extended Spacewalk** *(END, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Over up to an hour, perform steady work during a spacewalk or in a heavy suit. For example, a 10–60 minute repair job on a satellite while floating, or walking a few kilometers in a heavy envirosuit across a lunar surface. You manage suit resources (oxygen, cooling) and your own stamina. A skilled suit user moves efficiently to not waste oxygen and knows how to rest briefly without jeopardizing the mission. By the end, the task is done and you’re not overly fatigued or dangerously low on O2.  
- **Environmental Adaptation** *(INT, 1D hours)* – Spend several hours tweaking and using your suit in a particularly extreme environment. In 1–6 hours, maybe you traverse a sulfuric atmosphere where the suit’s cooling is strained, or a high-radiation area requiring adjustments to shielding. You make on-the-fly modifications (reroute cooling loops, adjust radiation visor settings) and monitor your biometrics closely. Surviving those hours intact with functional equipment is a testament to suit skill (and perhaps some *Engineer* aid). Many without training would have to retreat much sooner or suffer damage.  
- **Maintain Suit** *(EDU, 1D x 4 hours)* – Take half a day to perform detailed maintenance on a vacc/envirosuit. Over 4–24 hours, you swap out CO2 scrubbers, lubricate joints, repair microtears, and run vacuum pressure tests. Vacc Suit skill means you know each model’s quirks (like which seal rings tend to wear out), so you ensure those are fixed. After this maintenance, the suit is as good as new (mechanically removing any penalty from prior damage or long use). It’s ready for another tour of duty with minimal chance of failure.  
- **Multi-Suit Coordination** *(SOC/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Over a couple days, coordinate and train a team in suit protocols for a group mission. Perhaps 10–60 hours are spent with a crew of newbies practicing EVA drills: you teach hand signals for silent comms, how to perform leapfrog maneuvers with tethers, etc. By the end, that team functions as a unit in vacc suits – this might give them advantage in a later group EVA because they aren’t fumbling or confused. Essentially, you’ve imparted some of your expertise (their effective Vacc Suit skill for that operation might be considered one level higher due to your coaching).  
- **Survive Suit Isolation** *(END, 1D days)* – Endure being stuck in a vacc suit continuously for 1–6 days, such as after a hull breach when you have no safe cabin. You manage resources expertly: recycling moisture, doing low-activity to extend oxygen, maybe even venturing out to jury-rig power from solar panels to recharge life support. Each day is a challenge (food may be paste in suit dispenser, sleep is in microgravity or strapped in). Your Vacc Suit experience ensures you don’t make a fatal error like contaminating your air or overheating. When rescue arrives or life support is restored, you’re alive (likely hungry and stiff, but alive). Many would panic or succumb to CO2 narcosis long before – your training makes the suit a true lifesaver rather than a temporary bandaid.

## Zero-G  
*Zero-G* indicates training and adeptness in microgravity environments (floating in orbit, freefall in space). Those without it suffer penalties in such conditions.

- **Orient Self** *(DEX, 1D seconds)* – Immediately adjust your body orientation in microgravity. In a second or two, you decide which way is “down” for your current task (even though there’s no gravity) and rotate accordingly. This quick orientation prevents disorientation. For example, you enter a zero-G room and almost instantly align yourself to the same “plane” as the people already floating there, avoiding that awkward upside-down conversation moment.  
- **Push Off Target** *(DEX, 1D x 6 seconds)* – In a few seconds, launch yourself toward a destination with accuracy. With a gentle nudge off a wall (6–36 seconds to set and push), you propel in a straight line to catch a floating tool or reach a doorway. A trained zero-G mover gauges the needed force and direction precisely, so you neither overshoot nor miss the target. It looks effortless, whereas a newbie might flail or have to grab a wrong handle to stop themselves.  
- **Air Stop** *(DEX, 1D x 10 seconds)* – Use air resistance or minimal counter-movements to come to a halt in under a minute. In 10–60 seconds, by spreading out to increase drag in any residual atmosphere or by carefully timing a hand touch on a wall, you slow from a drift to stationary without banging into something. In vacuum, this might mean a delicate opposite kick or using a suit’s tiniest thrusters. Zero-G skill helps dissipate momentum safely.  
- **Move Quietly in Freefall** *(DEX, 1D minutes)* – Take a few minutes to traverse a zero-G environment silently. In 1–6 minutes, you pull yourself along handholds or through a zero-G corridor making virtually no noise (no rattling of equipment, no loud breathing). Perhaps you’re sneaking up on someone in a space station duct. Zero-G know-how combined with Stealth means even weightless, you can avoid the telltale clangs that would normally occur.  
- **Coordinate in Freefall** *(SOC, 1D x 10 minutes)* – Spend up to an hour guiding a small group of untrained people in zero-G so they don’t harm themselves. In 10–60 minutes, say you have three novice scientists on a spacewalk – you teach them on the fly how to move and stabilize. Or during a zero-G section of a ship, you verbally cue your team (“push slowly, one at a time”) as you all move through. Your presence and tips prevent accidents or excessive delay. At the end, the group reaches the goal with minimal bruises and gained a bit of confidence.  
- **Prolonged Freefall Work** *(END, 1D hours)* – Over several hours (1–6), perform manual work in zero-G without getting exhausted or careless. For instance, assembling a truss in orbit: you hold tools, tighten bolts, keep track of parts drifting. Zero-G skill helps manage effort (you’re not fighting nonexistent gravity or making unnecessary motions) so you can work for hours. Many find long freefall work nauseating or tiring (the constant drifting feeling), but you’re acclimated – your concentration and efficiency remain high throughout the task.  
- **Adjust to Gravity Change** *(END, 1D x 4 hours)* – Over half a day, adapt from zero-G to normal gravity or vice versa. If you’ve been weightless for a long time and now land on a planet, or you’ve just gone from spin gravity to freefall, it usually takes a toll. With skill, in 4–24 hours you do specific exercises and hydration protocols to hasten adaptation. You might avoid the worst of “space sickness” or muscle ache. After this period, you’re operating at near full capacity in the new gravity condition, whereas others might still be weak or dizzy (game-wise, you cleared any penalties faster).  
- **Zero-G Combat/Movement** *(DEX/INT, 1D x 10 hours)* – Across a day or two (10–60 hours), engage in activities like combat or complex movement exclusively in zero-G, maintaining tactical acumen and safety. This could be a series of zero-G firefights inside a derelict ship filled with floating debris. Your Zero-G skill means you use cover effectively (mag-locking your foot briefly to steady aim, pushing off at angles to flank in 3D space) and you don’t lose your weapon or ammo clips into the void. Over this extended period, you’ve basically “mastered” the battleground’s microgravity to the point where it might feel like an advantage against foes without such skill.  
- **Living in Zero-G** *(END, 1D days)* – Spend 1–6 days continuously in zero gravity (like in a small craft or station with failed grav plates) without suffering serious physical decline. You perform daily tasks – eating, personal hygiene, sleep – all in freefall, and maybe even do routine exercise to mitigate bone loss. With training, you know tricks (strap your feet under bars while sleeping to feel pressure, eat foods that reduce space sickness). By the end of a week, you emerge in decent shape – less skilled individuals might lose significant muscle mass, become severely disoriented, or develop motion sickness that doesn’t abate. Essentially, you can treat zero-G as just another environment, not a debilitating void, even over long durations.
