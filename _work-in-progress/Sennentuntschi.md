# *Sennentuntschi*

*A Swiss Alpine Horror Fable*

**Genre:** Folk Horror / Psychological Thriller
**Setting:** Remote Alpine pastures, early 14th century Switzerland
**Tone:** Realism laced with myth — bleak, tactile, wind-bitten, slowly descending into madness

## Canonical Myth Rules (seeded throughout)

1. **Breath Binds** — What you give breath to, binds your breath in return. (Kiss/creation become ritual.)
2. **Seen by the Guilty** — The Sennentuntschi is visible only to the complicit. Innocents pass through her presence unaware.
3. **Returned Measure** — Each man receives the shape of his own sin: domination → suffocation; cowardice → entrapment; complicity → time’s loop.

**Refrain / Rhyme (whisper motif):**

> “Nur d’Luft vom Herrgott.” / “Only God’s wind.”
> (Beats morph the line from swagger → indictment.)

**POV:** **Martin** (weak conscience). We ride his moral erosion.

**Aspect Ratio & Lens Grammar:** 1.66:1. Human proximity on 32–40 mm; 75–100 mm compressions for villagers/“moral distance.”
**Camera Motifs:** Locked horizons = human order; slow orbits = rite/encroaching will; creeping zoom for suffocation; subtle Dutch drift in sin beats.
**Light:** Naturalistic; fire-motivated interiors. Saturation drains across Act III largely in‑camera (art/wardrobe), minimal grade.
**Sound Palette:** Wind (aeolian harp fence), cowbells that detune by ¼‑tone as guilt rises, sparse alpine horn motif that warps across acts.

## ACT I — *The Making of a Sin*

### Scene 1 — “The Isolation”

**Location:** Alpine pasture, dawn.
**Visuals:** Wide establishing shots — fog over meadows, cowbells echo, three herdsmen trudging to their cabin.
**Action:** The men — *Erwin*, *Martin*, and *Albert* — are introduced in silence. They milk cows, fix fences, and eat in silence. The soundscape is dominated by the wind.
**Mood:** Crushing loneliness. Subtle foreboding.

#### S1 — **The Isolation** (Dawn, pasture)

**Objective:** Establish toil, loneliness, latent cruelty.

* **Rule Seeds:** Erwin spits “Only God’s wind” to the gust; wind answers (subtle).
* **Blocking/Action:** Wide master: fog sheet, the men trudge. **Hardship beat:** a calf in breech. Martin hesitates; Erwin orders, “Milk first.” They leave it to struggle (off‑frame sound).
* **Camera:** Horizon-locked wide; 32 mm; long takes.
* **Light:** Blue dawn, contrasty; no fill.
* **Sound:** Cowbells pure and in‑tune; distant aeolian moan.
* **Dialogue:** Minimal. Erwin (quiet boast): “Kein Priester da oben. Nur d’Luft vom Herrgott.”
* **Props:** Rope, pails, a weathered crucifix on a nail.
* **Anchor Frame:** Three figures crossing a frost‑whitened ridge; breath pluming.

### Scene 2 — “The Joke”

**Location:** Cabin interior, night.
**Action:** Around the fire, Erwin jokes that they should “make themselves a wife.” They laugh, half-drunk, but boredom and desire twist the humor into resolve.
**Cinematography:** Flickering firelight, handheld camera, long pauses between laughter.
**Dialogue Snippet:**

> **Erwin:** “No one comes up here. No priest. No law. Only God’s wind — and He don’t watch.”

#### S2 — **The Joke** (Night, cabin)

**Objective:** Blasphemy in miniature.

* **Rule Seeds:** Erwin **pins the crucifix face‑down** “so it won’t watch.”
* **Blocking:** Firelit half‑circle around coals. A **work‑song fragment** under breath (rhyme about straw/wind). The jest curdles into a dare.
* **Camera:** Handheld, shoulder‑height; long pauses between laughs.
* **Sound:** Crackle; wind fingers the shutters; a faint **two‑note horn** in the distance.
* **Dialogue Snippets:**

  * Erwin: “Mache mer eus e Wybe.” (“Let’s make ourselves a wife.”)
  * Martin (small laugh that dies): “Nur d’Luft…”
* **Motif:** First use of refrain, casual.

### Scene 3 — “The Creation”

**Montage:** They gather straw, wood, cloth. Bind it with twine. Shape breasts, a face, limbs. A crude doll — their *Sennentuntschi*.
**Lighting:** Harsh daylight through slats. The act feels ritualistic.
**Music:** A single alpine horn tone, low and mournful, stretched and distorted.
**End Beat:** They sit around her creation, uneasy.

#### S3 — **The Creation** (Day, interior montage)

**Objective:** Ritualize the making; plant Rule #1.

* **Actions:** Gather straw/cloth/wood. **Finger prick** on a needle; a drop stains the straw heart. **Erwin blows** into the chest cavity. Martin ties a ribbon (stolen from a cowbell strap?  Or given to him by a young girl on his way out of the village).
* **Camera:** Static tripod; harsh beams through slats; ritual coverage (hands, knots, breath).
* **Sound:** Silence stretched; horn tone—straight, unwarped.
* **Rule Seeds:** **Breath into chest**; blood binds.
* **Anchor Frame:** Straw chest rising slightly as Erwin exhales.



#### **S3 – Creation (insert):**

```
INT. HUT – DAY

Hard sunlight stripes the table. STRAW. CLOTH. A RIBBON.

MARTIN pricks his finger with a needle. A drop of blood sinks into a straw bundle.

ERWIN leans to the straw chest, sealing a seam with twine.

                         ERWIN
             (a breath, almost a kiss)
             Nur d’Luft vom Herrgott.

He BREATHES into the hollow. The straw rises... settles.
```

### Scene 4 — “The Dance”

**Location:** Outside cabin, twilight.
**Action:** Martin playfully dances with the doll. Laughter breaks tension. Then — he kisses it, his breath passes across her mouth and nose. The others watch, then join.
**Mood Shift:** From absurd to obscene.
**Camera:** Circles them slowly, creating dizziness.
**Foreshadow:** The doll’s head tilts slightly as the camera pans away.

#### S4 — **The Dance** (Twilight, outside)

**Objective:** Rite masquerading as farce.

* **Blocking:** Martin waltzes the doll; Erwin jeers; Albert watches, uneasy. **Kiss:** Martin’s breath moves across straw lips. The others, emboldened, repeat.
* **Camera:** **Slow orbit** (dolly + drift), minor Dutch increase; creeping zoom in last 10 s.
* **Wind Cue:** Gust syncs to **doll’s head tilt** (no puppetry shown—just reveal).
* **Sound:** Laughter thinning into wind; cowbells begin a faint micro‑detune.

#### **S4 – Dance (insert end beat):**

```
EXT. OUTSIDE HUT – TWILIGHT

They laugh. The camera ORBITS. The world tilts by degrees.

MARTIN kisses the straw mouth, playful.

A GUST. The DOLL’S HEAD tilts — no hand on it. Laughter dies.
```

### Scene 5 — “The First Sign”

**Night:** A storm. Wind howls.
Erwin wakes — the doll is no longer sitting where they left her.
A door creaks open. Straw trails across the floor.
**Lighting:** Lantern glow, long shadows.
**Sound:** A faint woman’s breath.

#### S5 — **The First Sign** (Night, storm)

**Objective:** Presence enters.

* **Blocking:** Lantern search. **Straw trail runs *against* the wind** across floorboards. Door creaks open.
* **Camera:** Lantern practical; deep shadows; parallax in tracking the straw line.
* **Sound:** **Faint woman’s breath** under the gale.
* **Rule Seeds:** Breath motif returns as counter‑rhythm to the storm.

## ACT II — *The Living Thing*

### Scene 6 — “The Woman”

**Morning Fog:** A figure stands outside. Barefoot, wearing the doll’s rags. Mud and straw cling to her hair.
**Action:** The men stare — confused, frightened. She doesn’t speak.  She only breaths
**Camera:** Extreme close-up of her eyes — reflective, almost glasslike.
**Erwin whispers:** “We made her.”

#### S6 — **The Woman** (Morning fog)

**Objective:** The uncanny reveal + Rule #2 seed.

* **Reveal:** Back‑lit figure in the fog, barefoot, in the doll’s rags. Straw and mud in hair glint like a halo.
* **Dog Beat:** Shepherd dog stares *through* her, growls at *the men*. (Innocent doesn’t register her.)
* **Camera:** Extreme close on her eyes—reflective, glasslike. Hold long enough to get audience self‑projection.
* **Dialogue:** Erwin (whisper): “Mir händ sie gmacht.” (“We made her.”)

### Scene 7 — “The Pact”

**Location:** Inside hut.
They feed her. She eats slowly, mechanically.
The men argue — fear vs fascination.
**Martin:** “Maybe she’s a lost soul.”
**Albert:** “Or punishment.”
**Erwin:** “We made her. She’s ours to do with as we please.”
**Tone:** Power shifts begin.

#### S7 — **The Pact** (Interior)

**Objective:** Power shifts; her first choice.

* **Blocking:** They place a bowl; **she deliberately sets it at Erwin’s seat**, not Martin’s. Eats **mechanically**, avoids the **salt cellar** (motif—decide: salt binds her **unless freely given**).
* **Camera:** Over‑shoulders on Martin, isolating; Erwin center‑punch, dominant.
* **Sound:** Wind dies whenever someone speaks truth; **candle sputters when someone lies** (Erwin: “We’ll keep you safe.” sputter).
* **Dialogue:**

  * Martin: “Verirrti Seel vielleicht.”
  * Albert: “Oder Strafe.”
  * Erwin: “Sie ghört eus.”

### Scene 8 — “Desecration”

**Night:** The men drink and jeer.
Erwin forces himself on her. The others watch, horrified but silent.
The candle flickers — her eyes open wide, unblinking.
**Sound:** Whispered female voices in the wind outside.
**Cut to:** The crucifix on the wall — cracks.

#### S8a — **Midpoint: The Absolution** (Dusk, outside the hut)

**Objective:** A failed attempt at grace; Rule #1 & #3 reinforce.

* **Action:** Albert chalks a circle; prayer in dialect; he lifts the crucifix upright. **For three breaths the wind stops.** Then returns **colder**, extinguishing the candle in his hands.
* **Camera:** 75 mm compression; frame him small against rolling fog—moral distance.
* **Sound:** Silence → a low sub‑pressure throb → wind slam. **Cowbells take first ¼‑tone sag.**
* **Outcome:** The chalk scatters. Her hair (straw) **stirs toward him** without her moving.

#### **S8a – Midpoint Absolution:**

```
EXT. OUTSIDE HUT – DUSK

ALBERT chalks a circle on stone. Sets the crucifix upright.

                         ALBERT
             Herr, gib Gnad.

For three breaths the WIND STOPS. A candle flame steadies.

Then — the air collapses. The candle blows out. Chalk scatters.
A strand of her STRAW HAIR moves toward him as if breathed on.
```

#### S8 — **Desecration** (Night, interior) — **ETHICAL STAGING**

**Objective:** Consequence without exploitation; her decision begins.

* **Blocking & Coverage:**

  * **Stay in Martin’s POV**. Shots on **men’s faces, hands, the crucifix cracking**, her **eyes in profile**. Never sexualize her body.
  * The **cut point** is the **crucifix cracking**; from there, a close on her eyes **changing**—not shock but *choice*.
* **Sound:** Wind rises; **women’s whispers** outside—non‑linguistic breathing textures.
* **Light:** Candle guttering with each lie; practicals only.
* **Safety:** Intimacy coordination, closed set, choreographed coverage; edit plan locked.

#### **S8 – Desecration (ethical staging excerpt):**

```
INT. HUT – NIGHT

CLOSE: MARTIN’S FACE, frozen. Breath loud. The candle GUTTERS.

CLOSE: ERWIN’S HAND, knuckles white.

CLOSE: THE CRUCIFIX on the wall — a HAIRLINE CRACK.

CLOSE: HER EYE, open now. Unblinking. Deciding.

OUTSIDE: The WIND carries layered WOMEN’S BREATHS.
```

### Scene 9 — “The Turn”

**Morning:** Livestock are slaughtered — entrails strung like garlands.
Footprints lead nowhere.
Albert prays, Martin packs to leave, Erwin mocks them both.
That night, Erwin wakes to find straw growing from his skin.

#### S9 — **The Turn** (Morning → Night)

**Objective:** Tailored judgments ignite.

* **Erwin:** Notices **straw extruding** from pores at wrists/neck as he breathes shallow. Attempts to shout; wind **steals his exhale** (Rule #1).
* **Albert:** Packs to leave; every path **loops him back** to the door. (360° dolly that resolves on the same frame to sell the loop; Rule #3 entrapment.)
* **Martin:** Finds the **doll pristine by the fire**, as if time reset (Rule #3: complicity → repetition).
* **Sound:** Cowbells more detuned; aeolian harp fence loud in mix.
* **Dialogue:** Martin (to self): “Nur d’Luft…?” now fearful.

#### **S9 – Erwin’s Turn (insert):**

```
INT. HUT – PRE-DAWN

ERWIN rubs his neck. Fine STRAW FIBERS poke through skin.
He exhales — but the breath is STOLEN sideways by a draft.
He tries again. Nothing. Panic.
```

## ACT III — *The Reckoning*

### Scene 10 — “One by One”

**Montage:**

* Albert runs into the mist; finds himself back at the same hut.
* Martin discovers the doll sitting by the fire again, perfectly clean, but she still has the last hints of being made of straw.
* Erwin screams as his reflection shows a straw doll version of himself, and he slowly stops breathing.
  **Cinematography:** Dream logic, desaturated tones.

#### S10 — **One by One** (Montage)

**Objective:** Dream logic execution.

* **Beats:**

  * Albert runs into mist → returns to hut; he sobs, prays; wind answers.
  * Martin reaches for her; **she steps away**, looks at the **open shutter** he left—*she chooses* where wind enters.
  * Erwin faces **a reflection of himself as a straw doll**, wheezing, then **breath stops** on screen.
* **Cinematography:** Desaturated, motion‑blurred intercuts; linger on the **open window** as agent.

### Scene 11 — “The Fire”

**Night:** Martin sets the hut ablaze, trying to end Erwin, the Sennentuntschi, and the curse
Through the flames, she walks — unburned, silent, and now fully human.  She has bruises and cuts on her face where the herdsmen abused her.
He screams prayers in dialect: “Herrgott, vergib uns!” (“Lord, forgive us!”)
**She reaches out — the screen cuts to white.**

#### S11 — **The Fire** (Night) — **ALCHEMY VERSION (chosen)**

**Objective:** Their test, not hers.

* **Action:** Martin torches the hut to “end the curse.” Through flame **she walks through smoke**; **straw becomes hair**, rags **become skin**—not immunity, **transformation**.
* **Blocking:** Martin falls to knees, prays: “Herrgott, vergib uns!”
* **Camera:** Backlit smoke; slow push‑in as silhouette **clarifies to human**.
* **Sound:** Horn motif bends; cowbells nearly atonal.
* **Theme:** She is **not of their guilt**—alchemy completes because they forced her into being; consequence returns to them.

#### **S11 – Fire (alchemy):**

```
INT./EXT. HUT – NIGHT

FLAME eats a wall. Smoke boils.

SHE WALKS THROUGH SMOKE. Where straw touched skin, HAIR unfurls.
Where rags touched arm, SKIN clarifies. Not immune — becoming.

MARTIN drops to his knees.

                         MARTIN
             Herrgott, vergib uns!
```

### Scene 12 — “The Return”

**Location:** Valley below, months later.
Villagers wait for the arrival of the herdsmen at the end of the summer season before the harvest and the snows.  They never come.
In desperation they hike up to find the herdsmen dead.
The female figure lays under the unburnt staw in what remains of their hut, she is untouched and unspoiled.  The villagers do not see her at all
The villagers retrieve the bodies of the herdsmen, and bury them in the remains of the hut.
A priest prays quietly and with sadness over their body, “Herr, nimm ihre Seelen an und vergib die Sünd’ aus ihrer Einsamkeit—dass sie Dei Atem an Stroh binde wollt’. Und all, wo das ghöred: Händ weg vom Werk vom Herrgott; was mer im Spott erschaffet, chunt im Gericht zrugg.”

#### S12 — **The Return** (Months later, valley & hut)

**Objective:** Rule #2 payoff; judgment’s aftermath.

* **Villagers:** Hike up; find the men dead. The hut is charred but **straw under the beams is fresh**.
* **Visibility Rule:** We **see her plainly in frame**, lying under straw. Villagers **do not**—they step past her shadow; a child’s **hand passes through light across her cheek** without reaction.
* **Priest’s Prayer (trimmed, weighty):**

  > “Herr, nimm ihre Seelen an und vergib die Sünd aus ihrer Einsamkeit. Händ weg vom Werk vom Herrgott; was mer im Spott erschaffet, chunt im Gericht zrugg.”
* **Camera:** 75–100 mm compressions—moral distance.
* **Sound:** Wind quiet, bells mute; a clean horn note—unbent.

#### **S12 – Return (visibility rule):**

```
INT. BURNT HUT – DAY

VILLAGERS step through wreckage. In plain sight beneath new straw
LIES THE WOMAN. No one looks at her. A CHILD’S HAND brushes light
over her cheek. Nothing.

A PRIEST whispers a prayer over the men’s bodies.
```

### Scene 13 — “The Epilogue”

**Modern Day Frame:** A female hiker, bruised and cut, finds a weathered journal — Erwin’s — describing the creation.
She laughs, dismisses it as legend.
As she leaves — a female figure moves in the mist behind her, following.

Several beats as the camera pulls back past the female figure moving in the mists and the screen turns to grey mist and clouds

#### S13 — **Epilogue (Modern Day)** — **Agency Twist (chosen)**

**Objective:** Close the loop without glorifying harm.

* **Action:** A hiker (bruised) finds **Erwin’s journal** with a **sketch of the spiral‑breath ritual**. She **laughs it off**.
* **Stalk Beat:** A figure in mist follows.
* **Final Movement:** Violent cut to the **doll’s eye**—blink, focus, searching. It **reflects a man’s hand rising** toward the hiker… **and the hand stops** mid‑air as a gust **pins it** (Rule #1—the wind’s breath *binds*). The horn motif holds; **cut to grey.**
* **Theme:** The myth **condemns** violence; it doesn’t perpetuate it.

#### **S13 – Epilogue (agency twist):**

```
EXT. RIDGE – MODERN DAY

A HIKER snaps the leather tie on a WEATHERED JOURNAL. A spiral of
lines: breath entering a straw heart.

She laughs, shoulders her pack, walks on. Mist blooms behind her.

SMASH TO: A DOLL’S EYE — live — blink, focus. In its surface:
A MAN’S HAND raised toward the hiker.

A GUST. The hand HANGS in the air, held by nothing.

HOLD the horn note. CUT TO GREY.
```

**Final scene:**
Violent Cut to:  The "doll’s" eye — blinking, focusing, searching... it finally stops, and as it does, it reflects a man raising his hand to strike the female hiker.

## Sound & Music Map (scene cues)

* **S1–S2:** Bells pure → first faint **aeolian harp**; horn clean.
* **S3–S5:** Silence as pressure; single horn note stretched in time; first whisper layers.
* **S6–S8a:** Wind dips at truth; **candle sputter = lie**. Bells begin **¼‑tone** sag at midpoint.
* **S8:** No score during SA beat; **breath** and **wood strain** lead; crucifix crack is the sting.
* **S9–S10:** Build to **atonal bell cluster**; harp now harsh.
* **S11:** Horn motif **bends** through transformation; bells nearly silent.
* **S12–S13:** Clean bell, clean horn; then final gust pins the raised hand.

## Prop / Symbol Continuity

* **Crucifix** (face‑down → upright → cracked)
* **Salt** (she refuses unless freely offered; if someone *offers* salt sincerely, wind calms 1–2 s)
* **Ribbon** (from cowbell strap → in her hair post‑alchemy)
* **Journal** (straw‑heart sketch + spiral breath diagram)

## Safety / Feasibility Cheats

* **Animals:** Daylight, second‑unit windows; no “performance” beats beyond crossings. Breech beat off‑frame, sold with sound + POV.
* **Weather:** Fog/haze rigs + wind machines; design **weather‑neutral** alternates for each critical beat.
* **Fire:** Partial hut on controllable backlot; transformation captured with on‑set smoke + **practical wardrobe changes** + hidden air cannons for straw‑to‑hair beat; comp plates from location.

## Lookbook Anchor Frames (describe for storyboard)

1. **S1:** Three herdsmen as ants on a frost ridge (1.66:1, horizon low).
2. **S3:** Blood drop in straw heart, beam of light and dust.
3. **S4:** Orbiting waltz; doll head tilt synced to gust.
4. **S6:** Back‑lit silhouette in fog; straw halo glint.
5. **S8:** Crack crawling across a crucifix like ice.
6. **S11:** Smoke‑shrouded figure mid‑transformation, ribbon now hair.
7. **S12:** She in frame foreground; villagers background blind to her.

## Style & Direction Notes

| Aspect           | Approach                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual Style** | Natural light, grainy texture (emulate 35mm film), minimal color grading until Act III where saturation drains. |
| **Sound Design** | Alpine ambient sound (wind, bells, animal calls), distorted whispers layered subtly into mix.                   |
| **Music**        | Sparse — occasional Swiss folk motifs twisted into dissonant tones.                                             |
| **Pacing**       | Slow-burn psychological descent; climax should feel inevitable, not explosive.                                  |
| **Themes**       | Isolation, blasphemy, creation and consequence, the loneliness of men and the vengeance of the divine. |
