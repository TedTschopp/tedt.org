_**Bottom Line Up Front:** AI is poised to transform the electric utility industry—but success depends on identifying and empowering “barrels,” the individuals who can lead AI adoption, drive real-time insights, and bridge operational and technical domains. For SCE and IT teams alike, this means modernizing infrastructure, sharpening data strategies, and investing in cross-functional talent. The future belongs to those who prepare, collaborate, and lead with intention._

**PART 2 OF 2: Barrels, Ammunition, & the Future of AI in the Electric Utility Industry**

**What Barrels, Ammunition, & the Future of AI in the Electric Utility Industry Means for SCE**

SCE faces unique challenges: managing aging infrastructure, meeting sustainability goals, and navigating regulatory complexities. AI advancements, particularly those that improve task adaptability and decision-making precision, can significantly enhance grid reliability, optimize energy distribution, and accelerate renewable energy integration.

However, the successful adoption of AI will depend on identifying and nurturing barrels within the organization. These individuals can:

*   Lead cross-functional teams to implement AI-driven systems.
*   Drive the adoption of real-time AI insights.
*   Pioneer initiatives that leverage AI to optimize forecasting.

Utilities that recognize and invest in their barrels will be better positioned to harness AI’s transformative potential.

**What This Means for IT**

IT organizations within the electric utility sector must evolve to support these changes. The rapid development of AI models like o1 and o3 requires:

1.  **Infrastructure Modernization:** Upgrading computational and network capacity to accommodate inference-time scaling models.
2.  **Data Strategy Overhauls:** Ensuring data quality, accessibility, and integration across legacy and modern systems.
3.  **Skill Development:** Training IT teams to recognize and support barrels who can bridge the gap between technical and operational domains.
4.  **Collaboration Models:** Fostering closer collaboration between IT and operational units to align AI initiatives with business objectives.

By becoming strategic partners in AI adoption, IT organizations can drive meaningful outcomes and position themselves as indispensable enablers of innovation.

**What I Should Do to Get Ready for This Change**

Here are actionable steps:

1.  **Identify and Cultivate Your Inner Barrel:** Reflect on your own strengths and how you naturally attract collaboration or achieve results. Challenge yourself with progressively complex tasks to expand your skills and discover your limits within that one area.
2.  **Invest in Your AI Readiness:** Learn about advanced AI models and their infrastructure requirements through online courses or industry resources. Improve your data literacy by understanding how to collect, clean, and analyze data effectively.
3.  **Build Your Cross-Functional Expertise:** Seek opportunities to learn about adjacent fields, such as IT, operations, or business strategy. Commit to continuous learning through workshops, webinars, or hands-on projects related to AI and its applications.
4.  **Evaluate Your Growth Curve:** Align your personal career goals with the growth trajectory of your organization and the electric utility industry. Identify areas where you can grow faster by seeking mentorship, taking on new challenges, or pursuing advanced training.
5.  **Engage in Strategic Planning for Your Future:** Stay informed about how AI is reshaping industries, and think about how these changes could affect your role or career path. Develop your own contingency plans by acquiring skills that prepare you for potential disruptions, ensuring you remain adaptable and valuable.
