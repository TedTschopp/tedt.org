Bottom Line Up Front: You can train Copilot to write in your personal voice by feeding it samples of your past writing. This article walks you through how to capture your tone, structure, and storytelling style—then turn that into a reusable prompt. The result? AI that doesn’t just help you write—it writes like you.

Here is a superpower for you to enhance your use of Copilot. You can have Copilot write something in your own style of writing.  Click on the link and head on over to Copilot for Web and use this prompt.  Make changes

I'd like your help in creating articles for [my blog tedt.org]. Your first task will be to understand my writing style based on examples that I give you. After that, we'll create some content. To start, please say GO AHEAD and I will paste examples of my writing. Keep saying GO AHEAD and I will paste new examples. When I am done I will give you additional instructions. 
```

Now you will copy and paste examples of your own writing style. If you are doing this for a blog, use blog posts you have written in the past that were well accepted. If this is for work related activities, use some of the work your co-workers think were effective. I used 5 blog posts.
