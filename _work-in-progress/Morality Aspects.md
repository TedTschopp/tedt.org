I am going to give you several aspects of morality.  I will give you a single sentence description for each aspect and then a longer description.  I want you to pick an opposing aspect of morality for each and then use a single sentence to describe it as well as the longer description.  Output your table with the following headers [Aspect] | [Short Description] | [Long Description] | [Counterpart Aspect] | [Counterpart Description] | [Counterpart Long Description].  Ensure everything is stated in the most postive manner possible.  Make sure each description does not include an opposite.

[Aspect]: Care/Empathy 
[Short Description]: Cherishing and protecting others; opposite of harm.
[Long Description]: Mammals have an unusually long period of development during which they are dependent upon their caretakers. Therefore, caretakers who were more sensitive to the needs and distress of their children were more likely to have children survive into adulthood. This sensitivity generalizes beyond our own children, and can be activated when we learn of other people’s children or even see artwork of animal babies that activate our urges to care and protect.  This can be linked to anger toward the perpetrator of the harm.

[Aspect]: Fairness / Proportionality
[Short Description]: Rendering judgment according to shared rules; opposite of cheating.
[Long Description]:All social animals interact with each other, and while there are debates as to whether any non-human animals have a sense of “fairness”, there is little debate that the sense of fairness can be found across human cultures emerges well before the age of five, and possibly before the age of one and is related to the evolutionary process of reciprocal altruism. People monitor the behavior and reputations of others; those linked to cheating become less attractive as partners for future interactions. 

[Aspect]:Loyalty / In-group
[Short Description]:Standing with your group, family, nation; opposite of betrayal.
[Long Description]:There are finite resources and coalitions compete for these resources. The coalitions that are most cohesive tend to prevail over less cohesive rival coalitions.  The intuitions generated by this foundation generalize to brand loyalty, political partisanship, and sports fandom today. When people show signs of being disloyal, they are labeled as traitors and may be ostracized from their groups, or even put to death (e.g., treason is an offense punishable by death in the US). When people are loyal group members, they are extolled as virtuous (e.g., as patriots).

[Aspect]:Authority / Respect
[Short Description]:Submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of subversion.
[Long Description]:Primates evolved for life in hierarchies. Non-human alpha males are generally more like bullies than like leaders. Human alphas can go either way, but there can be little doubt that the psychology of authority is essential for understanding human political behavior. Groups and companies that have clear lines of authority, in which the authority is respected and seen as legitimate, generally function better than leaderless or normless groups, or groups with autocratic and domineering leadership. People who do not respect authorities or traditions are often ostracized or punished for insubordination.

[Aspect]:Sanctity / Purity
[Short Description]:Abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of degradation.
[Long Description]:Pathogens and parasites threaten survival, and organisms that avoid contact with these contaminants are more likely to survive than their counterparts. The adaptive pressure to make accurate judgments about disease risk is especially strong for a group-living species whose diet includes scavenging, as seems to have been the case for early humans. The uniquely human emotion of disgust seems well-tuned as a “guardian of the mouth” for a highly social and omnivorous species.   "Behavioral immune systems" shows that contamination concerns can be generalized to social practices including being fearful of dissimilar others (e.g., immigrants) and a rejection of people who do not live in accordance with the group’s sacred practices.

[Aspect]:Liberty / sovereignty
[Short Description]:Disgust for the coercion by a dominating power or person; opposite of oppression.
[Long Description]:Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of living in small groups with individuals who would, if given the chance, dominate, bully, and constrain others.  The original triggers would therefore include signs of attempted domination.  Anything that suggests the aggressive, controlling behavior of an alpha male or female can trigger this form of righteous anger.

[Aspect]: Equity / Justice
[Short Description]: Ensuring equality in rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of grace.
[Long Description]: In contrast to fairness, which focuses on proportionality and reciprocity, the concept of equity emphasizes the importance of equality in the application of justice. This principle has roots in the social contract theories, which emphasize the need for equal treatment of all individuals under the law. Equity disregards the nuances of individual circumstances in favor of an egalitarian approach. In this view, grace and forgiveness are secondary to the rigid application of law and shared societal rules. While fairness may adjust the scales based on situational variables, equity holds the scales steady, ensuring that the same rules are applied universally. This often manifests in social systems as a strict adherence to codified laws and regulations, eschewing individual judgment or discretion.

[Aspect]: Honesty / Integrity
[Short Description]: Ensuring that communication aligns with an impartial, omniscient view of reality; opposite of lying.
[Long Description]: The concept of honesty and integrity revolves around the importance of truthful communication and behavior that aligns with ethical principles. The aspect is deeply rooted in the social fabric, where trust plays a critical role in relationships and community cohesion. In an ideal form, honesty would be assessed from the standpoint of an impartial, omniscient observer to whom all facts are known. Lying, the opposite of this virtue, erodes trust and has the potential to disrupt social bonds. While humans are not omniscient, the moral foundation of honesty and integrity encourages individuals to strive for this ideal by being truthful and transparent in their interactions. This aspiration towards an impartial, "god's eye view" of reality serves as a benchmark against which actions and statements can be evaluated for their truthfulness and reliability.

[Aspect]:Hospitality / Generosity
[Short Description]: Welcoming and aiding others, especially outsiders; opposite of selfishness.
[Long Description]: Hospitality and generosity are valued in many cultures as a form of altruism and social bonding. The act of welcoming strangers or offering help without expecting anything in return is considered virtuous. It harkens back to a time when nomadic cultures would rely on the generosity of others for survival. Even today, acts of hospitality can break down social barriers and create a sense of community, fostering relationships and social cohesion.

[Aspect]:Wisdom / Prudence
[Short Description]: Making decisions based on deep understanding and foresight; opposite of recklessness.
[Long Description]: Wisdom is often considered the ability to make decisions based on a deep understanding of various complexities—emotional, social, ethical, and beyond. This ability often comes from lived experience, introspection, and a thoughtful understanding of the broader consequences of one's actions. Prudent individuals are often good at balancing immediate needs with long-term goals, thereby maintaining social harmony and personal well-being.

[Aspect]:Humility / Modesty
[Short Description]: An awareness of one's limitations and a lack of arrogance; opposite of pride.
[Long Description]: Many cultures value humility and modesty as virtues that keep individuals grounded, maintaining a balanced perspective on their own importance within the broader community. This aspect has roots in religious teachings but also serves a social purpose by discouraging hubris and encouraging mutual respect.

[Aspect]:Self-Control / Discipline
[Short Description]: The ability to control one's impulses and desires; opposite of impulsivity.
[Long Description]: Self-control is valued as a moral virtue that allows individuals to live harmoniously in society by regulating their behavior according to social norms and ethical guidelines. It enables people to make long-term decisions that are beneficial for themselves and their community, rather than seeking immediate gratification.
