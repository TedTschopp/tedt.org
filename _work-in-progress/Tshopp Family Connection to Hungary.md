Got it. I’ll look into historical, linguistic, and genealogical connections between the Tschopp family of Basel (mid-15th century) and the Csapy/Čop families of Hungary and nearby Slavic regions. I’ll explore name etymology, migration routes, possible noble or military links, and church records that might suggest a shared origin or movement.

I’ll let you know what I uncover shortly.

# Tracing the Tschopp–Csapy–Čop Connection

## Introduction  
The **Tschopp family of Basel** has been documented back to the mid-15th century in Switzerland, yet earlier traces remain elusive. This has prompted speculation that the line may have originated further east. In particular, similarities in surnames raise the question of a link to the **Csapy (Csapi)** family of medieval Hungary or the Slavic surname **Čop**. Could the Basel Tschopps be descended from an émigré of a Hungarian/Slavic noble house? This report examines the evidence from **linguistics**, **historical migrations**, and **heraldry/nobility records** to explore a potential connection, and suggests research pathways to bridge the genealogical gap.

## Surname Etymologies and Variants  
**Tschopp (Swiss German):** In Swiss records, “Tschopp” (also spelled *Tschop, Tschopp*) appears as early as the 1400s ([Tschopp last name popularity, history, and meaning](https://namecensus.com/last-names/tschopp-surname-popularity/#:~:text=The%20surname%20Tschopp%20is%20believed,activities%20in%20the%20Swiss%20regions)). Linguistically, the name likely arose as a dialect nickname or occupational term. One etymology derives *Tschopp* from Middle High German **_joppe_** or **_schoppe_**, meaning “jacket” or “coat” ([Last name HOPP: origin and meaning - Geneanet](https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/HOPP#:~:text=Last%20name%20HOPP%3A%20origin%20and,perhaps%20a%20metonymic%20occupational)). This suggests it may have originally described a **wearer or maker of coats**, a loanword via Italian *giubba* (coat) ([Last name HOPP: origin and meaning - Geneanet](https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/HOPP#:~:text=Last%20name%20HOPP%3A%20origin%20and,perhaps%20a%20metonymic%20occupational)). Indeed, a Slovene source notes that the surname **Čop** (pronounced *Chop*) is of **Romansh/Italian origin meaning “fur coat”**, likely brought into Slovene lands by immigrants from northern Italy or Switzerland ([Interesting Facts](https://razstave.visitzirovnica.si/interesting-facts.html#:~:text=How%20to%20pronounce%20the%20surname,%C4%8Cop)). Notably, the renowned Slovene linguist **Matija Čop** (1797–1835) was known in German as *Matthias Tschop*, underscoring that **Čop and Tschopp were equivalent surnames** in different languages ([Matija Čop - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matija_%C4%8Cop#:~:text=Matija%20%C4%8Cop%20,Slovene%20linguist%2C%20polyglot%2C%20literary)). Thus, the Swiss *Tschopp* and Slavic *Čop* share a common phonetic root (pronounced “chop”) and semantic origin (a coat or **bundle of material** ([Tschopp last name popularity, history, and meaning](https://namecensus.com/last-names/tschopp-surname-popularity/#:~:text=The%20surname%20Tschopp%20is%20believed,activities%20in%20the%20Swiss%20regions))), hinting that they could stem from the same medieval nickname.  

**Csapy / Csapi (Hungarian):** The Hungarian surname **Csapy** (also seen as *Csapi, Chapy*) is likewise pronounced with a “chop” sound (Hungarian **“cs”** = */tch/*). Rather than an occupational name, Csapy is **toponymic** – deriving from a place name. Historical records show that the noble **Csapy family** “took the land of **Csap** (Chop) in 1282, from which they took their name” ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Baksa%20nemzets%C3%A9g%20els%C5%91%20ismert,52%2C%20tekint%C3%A9ly%C3%BCk%20is%20nagy%20volt)). *Csap* was a village/estate in Ung County (then Kingdom of Hungary, today *Chop* in western Ukraine). The family’s progenitors purchased Csap in 1282 and were thereafter known as “of Csap” (Latin *de Chapy*) ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Baksa%20nemzets%C3%A9g%20els%C5%91%20ismert,52%2C%20tekint%C3%A9ly%C3%BCk%20is%20nagy%20volt)). In archaic Hungarian orthography the name was written **Chapy**, but pronounced *Csapi* ([Chapy család. (Eszéni és polyánkai). | Nagy Iván - Arcanum](https://www.arcanum.com/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Nagyivan-nagy-ivan-magyarorszag-csaladai-1/harmadik-kotet-1435/chapy-csalad-eszeni-es-polyankai-1479/#:~:text=Chapy%20csal%C3%A1d,csal%C3%A1ddal%20egy%C3%BCtt%20Michb%C3%A1n)). It literally corresponds to the Hungarian word **csap**, meaning “plug, tap, or spigot” – possibly an old reference to a water feature or barrel tap, but in this case it clearly served as a **geographic surname**. The Csapy (Csapi) line belonged to the *Baksa* noble clan and had branches styled **Eszenyi** and **Polyánkai** (after other estates) ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Baksa%20nemzets%C3%A9g%20els%C5%91%20ismert,Vagyonuk%2C%20hatalmuk%20%C3%A9s%20k%C3%BCl%C3%B6n%C3%B6sen)). Meanwhile, in Slavic lands adjacent to Hungary, the same place *Csap/Chop* gave rise to the surname **Čop** among local people. We see, then, that **Tschopp, Čop, and Csap(i)** are linguistically connected – all three being phonetically similar and recorded historically as *Chop/Csop* – though their precise meanings differed (nickname vs. toponym). It would not be surprising for medieval scribes to transform one into the other when a family moved between language regions (for example, a Hungarian “Csapy” arriving in German-speaking Basel could be noted as “Tschopp”). 

**Spelling and Latinization:** Medieval record-keepers often latinized or respelled names according to local usage. A Hungarian noble **“de Chapy”** in Latin documents might appear in German as *von Tschapp* or *Tschop*. Conversely, a Swiss *Tschopp* recorded in a Latin text could be rendered **Copus/Coppus**. Indeed, the Slovene Čop family preserved the spelling *Čop* (with the háček), but Matija Čop himself sometimes wrote it as **“Zhóp”** in an older transliteration ([Interesting Facts](https://razstave.visitzirovnica.si/interesting-facts.html#:~:text=How%20to%20pronounce%20the%20surname,%C4%8Cop)). All these variants ultimately mirror the same consonant sound. Thus, when considering a Tschopp–Csapy link, **dialect and orthography changes** must be kept in mind: *Chopy, Tschop, Csap, Čap* could all refer to the same root-name depending on whether the context was Latin, German, Hungarian, or Slavic.

## Historical Contacts Between Switzerland and Hungary (14th–16th c.)  
During the late medieval period, **mobility between Central Europe and the Alpine region** was limited but not unheard of. Any connection between a Basel family and Hungarian/Slavic families would likely have occurred via specific historical avenues. Key contexts include **church councils, trade routes, military service, and scholarly exchange**:

- **Church Councils and Religious Delegations:** The early 15th century saw two major Church councils on the Rhine frontier: the **Council of Constance (1414–1418)** and the **Council of Basel (1431–1449)**. These councils drew participants from across Europe – including Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, and various Slavic lands. Notably, **King Sigismund of Luxembourg** (who was King of Hungary at the time) was a central figure at Constance ([Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#:~:text=Sigismund%20was%20one%20of%20the,the%20Hussite%20Wars%20that)). He traveled with a large retinue of Hungarian nobility and advisors. One member of his Hungarian entourage was **András (Andrew) Csapy**, a knight who distinguished himself in battles against the Hussites and was present at the Council of Constance in 1418 ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20persona%20grat%C3%A1k%20voltak,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)). Sigismund rewarded András Csapy with a coat of arms and membership in the chivalric **Order of the Dragon** at Constance (more on this below) ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20persona%20grat%C3%A1k%20voltak,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)) ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=ImageCsapy%20Andr%C3%A1s%201418%20,adom%C3%A1nyozott%20c%C3%ADmere%20a%20s%C3%A1rk%C3%A1nyrend%20jelv%C3%A9ny%C3%A9vel)). Another Hungarian, **László Csapy**, served as Sigismund’s court secretary and traveled to Rome in 1433 for the Emperor’s coronation ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=h%C3%ADr%C3%A9t%C5%91l%20visszhangzott%20az%20eg%C3%A9sz%20orsz%C3%A1g,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)). Given Basel’s proximity and role as the next council site, it’s conceivable that Hungarian delegates or their retainers passed through or stayed in Basel during those years. In 1433–34 the Council of Basel hosted protracted negotiations with **Hussite (Czech) delegates** from Bohemia – e.g. the Hussite leader Prokop the Great led a Czech delegation to Basel in 1433. This created a **Slavic presence in Basel** for an extended period. Such events provided opportunities for East–West interaction: a Hungarian or Bohemian nobleman might marry or have children abroad, or a scribe from the east might settle in a Swiss city. While specific records of a Csapy at Basel haven’t surfaced, **the timing aligns** – the Basel Tschopps appear soon after these councils, when some eastern families had been in the area.

- **Trade and Mercantile Routes:** Basel in the 15th century was a thriving **market city on the Rhine**, a crossroads of French, German, and Italian trade. Although direct trade between Switzerland and Hungary was less common than with Italy or France, there were pan-European commerce networks. Luxury goods like **Hungarian wine, wax, furs, and cloth** did reach Western Europe, often via intermediaries in German cities. For example, Polish and Hungarian merchants frequented fairs in Nuremberg and Frankfurt, and from there some traveled south to Basel or the Burgundian Low Countries ([A Detailed Map of Medieval Trade Routes in Europe, Asia, and Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/au82uz/a_detailed_map_of_medieval_trade_routes_in_europe/#:~:text=A%20Detailed%20Map%20of%20Medieval,of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary)) ([Activity 4: Trading Networks Prior to the 15th Century - World History](https://worldhistory.hcps.org/pages/spiffy2473bd2.html?unitNum=0&lessonNum=4&pageNum=8#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20trade%20routes,in%20Africa%2C%20Asia%2C%20and%20Europe)). Basel also hosted the **Lombard bankers and Italian merchants**, who in turn had connections eastward through Venice. A member of the Csapy/Čop family might have been involved in commerce (perhaps a younger son turning to trade) and settled in Basel. This is speculative but not impossible – medieval Basel’s records list a few foreign merchants and craftsmen settling in the city.

- **Military Service and Mercenaries:** The 14th–16th centuries saw continuous warfare – crusades, dynastic wars, and Ottoman conflicts – which sometimes **scattered soldiers far from home**. The Kingdom of Hungary in particular fought the Ottomans and also engaged in dynastic wars in Bohemia and Poland. Switzerland, on the other hand, was famed for its **mercenary soldiers**. It’s conceivable that a Hungarian warrior entered Swiss service or vice-versa. After 1450, Swiss mercenaries fought for various European monarchs (including the Habsburgs, who were also involved in Hungary). One intriguing possibility is that an **exiled noble or mercenary from Hungary** (perhaps of the Csapi clan) entered the service of a Swiss canton or of the Duke of Burgundy (who often hired Eastern European fighters) and then remained in Basel. Conversely, a Swiss soldier might have gone east (for instance, some Swiss fought in the crusade of Nicopolis in 1396 and the campaign of Varna 1444 alongside Hungarian forces). While we lack a direct account of a “Tschopp” in those campaigns, family lore in the Tschopp family holds that **“our family migrated into Switzerland from eastern Europe before the 15th century”** (as recounted in local tradition). This aligns with the idea of a medieval **migration or resettlement**, possibly due to war or political upheaval, around the 14th century.

- **Scholarly and Clerical Links:** Basel emerged as an intellectual center with the founding of the **University of Basel in 1460**. Students from across Central Europe came to study there in the late 15th and 16th centuries ([Historický ústav AV ČR - Events - Student Migration, Scholarly Networks and Book Culture. Basel and the Swiss Academies in their Relations to (East)Central Europe 15th–17th centuries](https://www.hiu.cas.cz/en/events/student-migration-scholarly-networks-and-book-culture-basel-and-the-swiss-academies-in-their-relations-to-east-central-europe-15th-17th-centuries-14#:~:text=Institute%20of%20History%20of%20the,religious%2C%20thought%20and%20scholary%20networks)). Notably, Basel’s humanist printers (like Johannes Froben) in the early 1500s published works by authors from Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary, fostering a cosmopolitan milieu. Earlier, in the 14th century, the Church also provided avenues for mobility – e.g. Hungarian and Czech clergy attended universities in Paris and Bologna; some could have visited Swiss monasteries or cathedrals en route. If a member of the Csapy family had entered the **clergy**, he might have been present at the Councils or sent to a post in Switzerland. For instance, the Basel council prompted the exchange of many clerics and scholars; **contacts between Basel’s clergy and Hungarian clergy** were recorded (the Hungarian delegate to Basel, Archbishop of Kalocsa, was even elected Pope briefly by the council faction in 1439). Any cleric or educated layman from Hungary with a name like *Chapy/Čap* could have been noted in Basel chronicles, possibly Latinized as *Capetus* or Germanized as *Tschopp*. While specific evidence is scant, the **Council of Basel’s multi-ethnic atmosphere** provides a plausible setting for an “Eastern” Tschopp to appear in Swiss records.

In summary, the historical backdrop shows multiple channels by which **a Hungarian/Slavic Csap(i)/Čop could migrate to Switzerland** in the 14th–15th centuries: participation in church councils (with *Sigismund’s court* or *Hussite delegations*), involvement in long-distance trade, or military service and ensuing relocation. The mid-1400s timing of the first Basel Tschopp entries corresponds to the aftermath of these events, lending credence to the idea of an immigrant ancestor.

## Noble Lineages and Heraldry: Clues from the Csapy Family  
If the Basel Tschopps indeed sprang from the Hungarian **Csapy/Csapi** line, evidence might be found in noble family records or heraldic symbols. The Csapy were a **minor noble family of Hungary** with notable ties and a dramatic history:

 ([Fájl:Chapy András címere 1418.jpg – Wikikönyvek](https://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/F%C3%A1jl:Chapy_Andr%C3%A1s_c%C3%ADmere_1418.jpg)) *Coat of arms granted to **András Csapy** in 1418, featuring a lion pierced through the eye by an arrow and the dragon-emblem of the Order of the Dragon ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=famili%C3%A1risa%20%28,74%2C%20a%20%2075%20s%C3%B3v%C3%A1ri)).* This armorial achievement, awarded by King Sigismund at the Council of Constance, provides rich symbolism. The **arrow through the lion’s eye** represented *András Csapy’s own battle wound* – he was injured in the eye during the siege of Ostrov Castle fighting Sigismund’s rebel kinsman, as the charter recounts ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=famili%C3%A1risa%20%28,74%2C%20a%20%2075%20s%C3%B3v%C3%A1ri)). The presence of a dragon (coiled around the shield and helmet) displays his induction into the **Order of the Dragon**, an exclusive chivalric order Sigismund founded to defend Christendom ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20persona%20grat%C3%A1k%20voltak,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)). The original grant (issued at Constance on 19 March 1418) survives in archives and was not just for András alone – it explicitly allowed **his kinsmen** to use the coat of arms as well ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=fia%20Mikl%C3%B3s%2C%20fia%20Andr%C3%A1s%20,74%2C%20a%20%2075%20s%C3%B3v%C3%A1ri)). Indeed, several related families of the broader clan (the **Agóchy, Szerdahelyi, Bocskai, Sóvári**, etc.) later bore the same or modified arms ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=rokon%C3%A1val%20egy%C3%BCtt%20kapta%20Zsigmond%20kir%C3%A1lyt%C3%B3l,74%2C%20a%20%2075%20s%C3%B3v%C3%A1ri)). This means the **Csapy coat of arms became a shared emblem** of a kinship network. If a branch of this kin network migrated west, they might be expected to carry a similar heraldic device or at least appear in records as *armigeri* (armigers).

The **Csapy family tree** (as described in Hungarian genealogies) traces back to the *Baksa (Boxa) nemzetség*, a kindred in medieval Hungary. The clan’s ancestor was one *Mikch (Mikcs) bani* in the late 13th century ([Szabolcs-Szatmár-Beregi levéltári évkönyv 17. (Nyíregyháza, 2006) | Könyvtár | Hungaricana](https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SZSM_Ek_17/?pg=284#:~:text=Simon%20lesz%C3%A1rmazottainak%20csal%C3%A1dnevei%20lettek,egy)) ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Baksa%20nemzets%C3%A9g%20els%C5%91%20ismert,Vagyonuk%2C%20hatalmuk%20%C3%A9s%20k%C3%BCl%C3%B6n%C3%B6sen)). His son Simon had several sons who acquired lands including **Csap, Eszeny, Szürte, Teleki, Lónya, Szalóka, Ásványi** (all in the Upper Tisza region) ([Szabolcs-Szatmár-Beregi levéltári évkönyv 17. (Nyíregyháza, 2006) | Könyvtár | Hungaricana](https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SZSM_Ek_17/?pg=284#:~:text=az%20apa%20,az)). Simon’s descendants split into branches named after these estates – notably, the ones taking **Csap (Csapi/Csapy)**, **Eszeny (Eszenyi)**, and **Szürte (Szürtei)** persisted as family names ([Szabolcs-Szatmár-Beregi levéltári évkönyv 17. (Nyíregyháza, 2006) | Könyvtár | Hungaricana](https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SZSM_Ek_17/?pg=284#:~:text=%C3%A1sv%C3%A1nyi%2C%20csapi%2C%20sz%C3%BCrtei%2C%20teleki%20,z%C3%A1rd%C3%A1t%20%C3%A9p%C3%ADttetett%20s%20azt%20sz%C3%A1rmaz%C3%A1s%C3%A1nak)). The Csapy branch rose to prominence in the 14th–15th centuries. They were reputed as **courageous warriors**, with royal favor and high-standing at court: “the fame of the Csapys’ valor echoed throughout the country,” and they were *persona grata* with the king ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20persona%20grat%C3%A1k%20voltak,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)). King **Sigismund** not only granted them arms but also took **László Csapy** to Italy in 1433, and likely employed other family members in his service ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=h%C3%ADr%C3%A9t%C5%91l%20visszhangzott%20az%20eg%C3%A9sz%20orsz%C3%A1g,58%20R%C3%B3m%C3%A1ban%20j%C3%A1rt%20Zsigmond%20k%C3%ADs%C3%A9ret%C3%A9ben)). The Csapys held substantial estates, primarily in **Ung County** (around Uzhhorod/Uzhorod and Mukachevo today) and also lands in neighboring counties like Zemplén and Bereg ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20gazdag%20%C3%A9s%20hatalmas,sz%C3%A1zad%20k%C3%B6zepe%20t%C3%A1j%C3%A1n%20haltak%20ki)). Their power began to wane by the 16th century – the **male line died out in the mid-1500s** with no successors carrying the Csapy surname ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=A%20Csapyak%20gazdag%20%C3%A9s%20hatalmas,sz%C3%A1zad%20k%C3%B6zepe%20t%C3%A1j%C3%A1n%20haltak%20ki)). However, their relatives, such as the **Bocskai family**, continued into later centuries (the famous Prince Stephen Bocskai of Transylvania was of this clan). 

Given these facts, if the Basel Tschopps were an offshoot of this noble house, one might look for **shared heraldic or naming patterns**. For instance, did the Basel Tschopps use a coat of arms with a lion or arrow motif? Basel’s burgher families sometimes adopted coats of arms; if a Tschopp in 1500s Basel had a lion rampant in his seal, that could be a tantalizing clue. A search in Basel archives or civic heraldry books (e.g., the *Wappenbuch der Stadt Basel*) for any Tschopp arms could be worthwhile ([Coat of arms (crest) of Wappenbuch der Stadt Basel)](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/wiki/Wappenbuch_der_Stadt_Basel#:~:text=Coat%20of%20arms%20,only%20contains%20images%2C%20no%20text)). So far, no evidence of a lion-and-arrow crest in Swiss context has been noted, but this line of inquiry could be deepened by examining seals on legal documents or guild records.

Another clue is **family naming**: the Hungarian Csapys frequently used names like *András, László, Tamás, Miklós* (Andrew, Ladislaus, Thomas, Nicholas) over generations ([Csapy család – Wikipédia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csapy_csal%C3%A1d#:~:text=a%20b%C3%A1r%C3%B3%20V%C3%A9csey,Bocskai%2C%20a%20%2075%20s%C3%B3v%C3%A1ri)). If the early Tschopps in Basel had first names matching those (especially uncommon ones by Swiss standards), it might indicate a connection. For example, a *Niklaus Tschopp* or *Endres (Andreas) Tschopp* in 1450 Basel might hint at an origin from a Miklós/András Csapi. Basel records from the 15th century can be checked for unusual first names in the Tschopp family. 

We should also consider the **Slavic Čop nobility** in neighboring regions. In Slovene lands (Carniola) and Croatia, there were families named **Čop** by the early modern period. The Slovene Čop mentioned earlier were apparently of foreign origin (the Romansh “fur coat” etymology suggests a link to an Alpine or Friulian immigrant) ([Interesting Facts](https://razstave.visitzirovnica.si/interesting-facts.html#:~:text=How%20to%20pronounce%20the%20surname,%C4%8Cop)). In northern Croatia/Slavonia, the surname *Csapi/Čapi* appears in records of the 15th century – for instance, a noble **Nicholas Csapi** is noted in Slavonia around 1495 as acquiring estates via marriage ([[PDF] THE NOBLE ELITE IN THE COUNTY OF KÖRÖS (KRIŽEVCI) 1400 ...](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42930531.pdf#:~:text=,In%201495%20and%201507)). This indicates that branches of the Csapi family were present in other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (Slavonia was under the Hungarian Crown). It is conceivable that *some members adopted Slavic spellings* (Čap or Čop) when living among South Slavs. If a member of the Čop family from Carniola or Slavonia moved further west, they might show up in Austrian or Swiss records as “Chop” or “Tschop.” While this remains circumstantial, it highlights that **bearers of the “Chop” surname existed across Central Europe**, and not solely in Switzerland. 

In summary, the Csapy noble line provides a compelling possible origin for the Basel Tschopps. The **timeline** fits (Csapys flourishing in the 1400s and disappearing by 1550, just as Tschopps appear in 1450s Basel), the **phonetics** match (Csapy = Chopy = Tschopp), and the **historical intersections** (Council of Constance/Basel) place Csapys in the vicinity of Switzerland at the right time. However, to move from conjecture to proof, one would need to find documentary links – for example, a record of a *“Johann Csap alias Tschopp”* entering Basel citizenship, or a reference in Hungarian archives to a Csapi who “went abroad to the land of the Swiss.” Such evidence has not yet been found, but the avenues above guide where to look.

## Bridging the Gap: Research Paths Forward  
Connecting the **Basel Tschopp lineage with the Csapy/Čop families** will require meticulous research in both Swiss and Eastern European sources. Here are several strategies and archives that could shed light on this cross-regional genealogy:

- **Basel Archives:** The **State Archive of Basel-Stadt** (Staatsarchiv Basel) holds medieval charters, tax registers, and citizenship rolls. A focused search for the earliest mentions of *Tschopp* (or variants like Tschop, Tschob, Chop) in the 15th century Basel records is essential. Pay attention to any descriptors – e.g., “Heinrich Tschopp, genannt Unger” (nicknamed “the Hungarian”) or “Tschopp aus dem Elsass” (from Alsace) – which could hint at foreign origin. Basel tax records circa 1440–1500 might list the birthplace or origin of new residents. If the family was involved in a guild, the **Zunft** records (guild registers) might preserve a coat of arms or note of origin. Given Basel’s position in the Holy Roman Empire, also consult imperial **feudal records**: if a Csapi had imperial knighthood, the name could appear in imperial registers accessible in Swiss archives or the Austrian State Archives.

- **Swiss Family Books:** Switzerland has compilations of old families (e.g., **“Geschlechterbuch der Stadt Basel”** or the Swiss Surname Book). These often include legends or notes on origin. The Tschopp entry might mention the family’s own tradition of coming from “the Kingdom of Hungary” – indeed, one modern source (a Reddit heraldry discussion) noted that *family folklore* in the Basel Tschopps claims an Eastern European origin and even reference to serving under a Hungarian king (Ladislaus IV) in the 1200s. While folklore isn’t proof, it often preserves a kernel of truth that can guide where to verify in records ([Tschopp family from Basel Switzerland : r/heraldry - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/heraldry/comments/1bjxgy0/tschopp_family_from_basel_switzerland/#:~:text=Tschopp%20family%20from%20Basel%20Switzerland,the%20family%20folklore%20is%20true)). Thus, local published histories or genealogies of Basel families should be checked for any mention of the Tschopp’s origin story.

- **Hungarian National Archives:** In Budapest, the **Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár (MNL)** holds extensive medieval documents. Relevant would be any charters concerning the Csapi (Baksa clan) lands. We know from the *Csapy family chronicle* that **Tamás (Thomas) Csapi** established a Pauline monastery at Eszeny in 1355 ([Szabolcs-Szatmár-Beregi levéltári évkönyv 17. (Nyíregyháza, 2006) | Könyvtár | Hungaricana](https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SZSM_Ek_17/?pg=284#:~:text=Simon%20lesz%C3%A1rmazottainak%20csal%C3%A1dnevei%20lettek,egy)) and that the family remained prominent through the 1400s. One approach is to see if **after 1500** any documents mention the last of the Csapys or any dispersion of their estate. For example, if the line “died out” in the mid-16th century, did some members relocate rather than simply go extinct? The loss of their Ung county stronghold during the wars with the Ottoman Empire (mid-1500s) could have forced survivors to flee west into Habsburg domains (Austria or Moravia). It’s worth searching the Hungarian archives for names like “Chapy” or “Csapy” in later periods – sometimes emigrants pop up in unexpected places. Additionally, the **Nagy Iván genealogical collection** (published 19th c.) on Hungarian families ([Chapy család. (Eszéni és polyánkai). | Nagy Iván - Arcanum](https://www.arcanum.com/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Nagyivan-nagy-ivan-magyarorszag-csaladai-1/harmadik-kotet-1435/chapy-csalad-eszeni-es-polyankai-1479/#:~:text=Chapy%20csal%C3%A1d,csal%C3%A1ddal%20egy%C3%BCtt%20Michb%C3%A1n)) and the journal **“Turul”** (a genealogical journal) have articles on the Csapy and related families. The Wikibooks entry cited **Fejérpataky’s 1883 article “Chapy-czímer és a Sárkány-rend”** ([Fájl:Chapy András címere 1418.jpg – Wikikönyvek](https://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/F%C3%A1jl:Chapy_Andr%C3%A1s_c%C3%ADmere_1418.jpg#:~:text=aktu%C3%A1lis2017,84xw.html)) – consulting this (and its references) might give leads, such as any mention of Csapy descendants outside Hungary.

- **Regional Archives in Transylvania and Slovakia:** Parts of the Csapy clan’s history might be recorded in local archives of regions that were under the Hungarian Crown but now are in other countries. For instance, **Uzhhorod (Uzhorod)** and **Mukachevo** archives (in Ukraine) might have records of local noble families. Similarly, the **Slovak National Archive** could hold records for Ung and Zemplén county nobility. The Csapi were related by marriage to other families (e.g., the *Tibai family* of Ung, as seen with Margaret Csapi ([Tibai family - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibai_family#:~:text=,before%201398))). Tracing those collateral lines could uncover a reference to a “lost” member. If one family chronicle were to mention “so-and-so Csapi went west to the Emperor’s lands,” that would be a breakthrough.

- **Records of the Councils**: The Council of Constance and Basel proceedings are documented in chronicles (e.g., Ulrich Richental’s illustrated chronicle of Constance lists participants and their armorial bearings ([The long years of the Council of Konstanz | Rechtsgeschiedenis Blog](https://rechtsgeschiedenis.wordpress.com/2017/09/27/the-long-years-of-the-council-of-konstanz/#:~:text=The%20long%20years%20of%20the,around))). Checking such chronicles for names resembling Csapy/Chapy is worthwhile. Richental’s *Chronik* of Constance (1483) includes tables of arms of knights present – look for a lion with an arrow, which would confirm András Csapy’s presence. The Council of Basel’s records (less illustrated, but the acts may list delegates and their retinues) could also be searched for Central European names. If *Andreas de Chapy* or a Latin equivalent appears, it connects the dots between Hungary and Basel directly. Furthermore, the **Order of the Dragon rolls** (if preserved) list its knights – confirming András Csapy and potentially others of the family who were members.

- **Heraldic Sources:** Pursuing heraldry, one might contact the **Heraldry Society of Switzerland** or review compilations of coats of arms in Basel or Bern. Sometimes immigrant families brought their seals – for example, if a Csapy arrived in Basel, he may have sealed a document with his Hungarian arms (lion and arrow). A trained eye might spot a foreign-looking seal in Swiss collections. The fact that the Csapy arms were later used by the **Bocskai family** is interesting: the Bocskai coat of arms (a lion pierced by an arrow) is well-known in Hungarian heraldry. If any Swiss archive holds a seal with that device, it would strongly suggest a Csapy/Bocskai presence. (It might be a long shot, but recall that after the Csapy line ended, the Bocskai continued – Stephen **Bocskai** in 1605 led a rebellion against the Habsburgs; perhaps his family had Western contacts or exiles.)

- **Genetic Genealogy:** As a complementary approach, **DNA testing** could be explored. If male-line descendants of the Basel Tschopp family (who can document their line back several centuries in Switzerland) were to do a Y-DNA test, the results might be compared against any known Hungarian aristocratic DNA data (some projects exist for medieval noble clans in Hungary). If, for instance, Tschopp Y-DNA matched that of a family known to descend from the Baksa clan, it would be strong evidence of a link. This is a modern technique that might provide clues even when paper records are missing.

- **Slavic Records:** Don’t overlook the possibility that the Tschopp ancestor might have been **Slavic (Czech or Slovak)** rather than Hungarian. The Hussite wars (circa 1420s) displaced many Czech soldiers and followers; after the wars, some became mercenaries (*“Soldner”*) across Europe. A man named e.g. Jan Čapek (which is Czech for “little Čap/Čop”) actually was a Hussite commander. While Jan Čapek of Sány is a different surname (Čapek) and remained in Bohemia, the coincidence of names is interesting. Perhaps a Czech **Čap** or **Čop** who fought in those wars later found refuge in Basel (which had a sympathetic ear to the moderate Hussites in the 1430s). Czech archives of the **Hussite period** or the subsequent **Unitas Fratrum (Brethren)** might mention exiles who left for Switzerland or Germany. Basel, being a free city and later a hub of the Reformation, did attract some refugees in the early 16th century (though that might be a bit late for founding a family line by 1450). Still, checking sources on **Czech–Swiss contacts** could be fruitful.

In essence, bridging this gap requires a combination of **historical detective work** and openness to multiple possibilities. The convergence of surname etymology, timeline, and contextual events makes a **Tschopp–Csapy/Čop connection plausible**. The Tschopp family of Basel may well carry in their name a distant echo of the plains of Hungary or the hills of Carniola. To prove it will demand piecing together archival clues from Basel to Buda. Researchers should systematically comb through the suggested archives and perhaps uncover that one elusive document – be it a **marriage contract, a letter of safe-conduct, or a feudal grant** – that explicitly ties a person of the “Chop/Csap” name to both regions. Until then, the hypothesis remains enticing and worth pursuing with the interdisciplinary approach outlined above.

## Conclusion  
While definitive proof remains to be found, the **historical, linguistic, and genealogical evidence** assembled here points toward a potential common thread linking the Basel Tschopps with the Hungarian **Csapy** and Slavic **Čop** families. The surnames share a common sound and even meaning (coat/Čop) across languages, suggesting a root in the same medieval nickname or place. The **Csapy nobles of Hungary** provide a credible origin: they were prominent in the 13th–15th centuries and interacted with the German-speaking world (notably at Constance in 1418), just before the Tschopps emerge in Swiss records. Basel, as a crossroads of **church, trade, and military activity**, was precisely the sort of place where an Eastern lineage could transplant and take on a localized form. 

To solidify this link, further research is encouraged in both Swiss and Central European archives, focusing on the tumultuous 1400s when people, like their surnames, often traveled far from home. By examining **primary sources** – charters, council diaries, family registries – and even leveraging modern methods like DNA, one might finally illuminate the path by which a *Csapy of Csap* became a *Tschopp of Basel*. Until such evidence is uncovered, the connection must be viewed as an intriguing possibility grounded in **etymological parallels and historical context**. Regardless, this investigation vividly illustrates how **feudal Europe’s web of alliances, wars, and migrations** could interweave the fate of a Basler family with that of knights on the Hungarian frontier. In tracing our ancestors’ journeys, we often rediscover the interconnected nature of medieval Europe – a world where a Swiss “Tschopp” might indeed carry the legacy of a Hungarian “Csap.”
