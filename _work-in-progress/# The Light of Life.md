# The Light of Life

## Setting: Switzerland, late mid-15th century

## Synopsis:
A small, isolated village in the Swiss Alps has been plagued by mysterious deaths of children. The villagers are desperate for answers and help. Rumors of an old folk tale about "life lights" have surfaced, hinting at a dark secret behind the tragedies. The adventurers are drawn to the village to uncover the truth and stop the deaths.

## The Tale:
Once, a man was suffering from a deep illness, and the physician had already given up on him. In his mortal fear, he fetched for a certain old woman and sought her advice and aid. She indeed consoled him with the knowledge that he did not have to give up all hope. For if he were to manage to switch his life light, he would become healthier than ever before. However, otherwise he would be doomed to die.

Astonished, the man asked what the “life light” was, and listened to the explanation that every person had such a light. As long as this light burns, the person continues to live, but as soon as it expires, the person will expire as well. The woman likewise knew about the place where those lights burned. The sick man should stand up from his bed, no matter how painful this would be for him, and walk straight ahead into a certain direction until he finally got there. As soon as he had reached this location, he should seek out his own light and exchange it with the light of a child. In this manner, the child would die once the life light of the sick man had sputtered out, but he himself would life as long as the child had been supposed to live.

The man did as he was told, rose up from his bed, and wandered straight ahead. In the beginning it was extremely arduous, and part of the way he even had to crawl on all fours, but finally he reached his desired destination. Many, many lights burned there, and he likely would never have found his own life light if there hadn’t been a friendly old man there who showed it to him. It burned weakly now, but close to it there was a large, long, and brightly burning child’s light. Quickly, he grabbed it, and switched the locations of the two lights. As soon as he had done so, he was hale and healthy again and could go homewards fresh and chipper.

However, the child whose life light he had taken died on the very next day.

3. **Clues and Rumors:**
    - **Initial Clue:** A child’s drawing showing a man walking into the mountains with lights burning around him.
>You find the drawing tucked away in the corner of a small, dimly lit room in one of the village houses. It is crudely sketched on a piece of rough parchment, its edges frayed and browned with age. The drawing appears to have been done with a charcoal stick, the lines smudged in places where small fingers might have grasped too tightly. The parchment itself tells a story of its own. It is coarse and fibrous, likely made from flax or hemp. The drawing’s imperfections, with smudges and uneven lines, hint at the young age of the artist, a child trying to capture a vision or a memory that defies simple explanation.
>
>The image is hauntingly simple yet powerful. It depicts a lone figure, a man, walking into the jagged peaks of the Swiss Alps. His posture is hunched, as if burdened by an unseen weight. Around him, the mountains rise like dark sentinels, their outlines stark against the pale background of the parchment.
>
>What catches your eye are the small, flickering lights drawn around the man. They are scattered throughout the mountains, some clustered together, others standing alone. Each light is represented by a small, bright mark, contrasting sharply with the dark charcoal used for the rest of the drawing. The lights seem almost to glow, their ethereal quality suggesting something otherworldly.
>
>Between the lights, the artist has drawn faint, shadowy figures, their forms barely discernible but unmistakably present. These shapes appear to move among the lights, interacting with them in ways that are mysterious and unsettling. The figures are vague, their outlines blurred, giving them an eerie, ghost-like appearance.
>
>The scene depicted in the drawing resonates with a strange, almost sacred energy, as if the child who created it had glimpsed something profound and otherworldly. As you study the image, a chill runs down your spine, and you can’t shake the feeling that you are looking at a fragment of a much larger, darker mystery that lies hidden in the mountains beyond the village.

   - **Rumor 1:** An old woman (Frau Ursula) speaks of a place in the mountains where life lights burn, hinting at a dark ritual.
> Frau Ursula sat by the fire, her wrinkled hands clutching a cup of herbal tea. Her eyes, sharp despite her years, glinted with a mixture of fear and reverence. She began her tale in a hushed tone, her voice carrying the weight of long-held secrets.
>
> "As a young maid, I often strayed from the village, drawn to the wild peaks of the Alps. One evening, I snuck away, the sun dipping low behind the crags. As I climbed higher, the woods grew thick and the shadows long. Soon, darkness crept in, and I found myself lost in the blackness.
> 
> The air turned cold, and every rustle in the underbrush made my heart race. I pressed on, hoping to find my way back, but instead, I stumbled upon a sight I had never imagined. Below me, in a hidden vale, thousands of lights flickered like stars fallen to earth. They burned bright and steady, each one a tiny flame in the gloom.
> 
> My breath caught as I watched dark shapes moving among the lights. These beings, if beings they were, seemed to tend the flames with great care. They moved with a grace that was both eerie and beautiful, their forms shifting like smoke. The sight filled me with a strange awe, as if I had stumbled upon something holy and otherworldly.
> 
> I stood there, frozen, until a sudden gust of wind chilled me to the bone. The fear of being discovered gripped me, and I fled, my feet barely finding purchase on the rocky ground. I scrambled down the mountain, guided only by the faint memory of home.
> 
> When I finally reached the village, the first light of dawn was breaking. I was shivering, my clothes torn and my heart pounding. I knew then that I had seen something of great power, something that was not meant for mortal eyes. The memory of those lights and the dark shapes has haunted me ever since, a reminder of the mysteries that lie hidden in the high places."
> 
> Frau Ursula fell silent, her gaze distant. The fire crackled softly, casting long shadows in the room. The adventurers leaned in, sensing the weight of her words and the truth behind the old tale of the life lights.

   - **Rumor 2:** The local priest mentions old records of similar deaths centuries ago, linked to a cursed location.

> Father Johann sighed, his gaze steady as he looked at you. "Aye, there have been whispers of such things in the past. It was only a fortnight ago, while I was tending to repairs in the church, that I stumbled upon something curious. I had to move the altar to fix a loose stone beneath it—an old problem, you see, that needed tending before the winter cold set in. And there, hidden in a small, dusty compartment, I found a bundle of ancient records.
> 
> These records tell of deaths similar to what we see now—children taken by a strange illness, their lives snuffed out suddenly and without warning. The villagers back then spoke of a cursed location in the mountains, a place where life lights burned and dark shapes moved among them. They believed these lights held the essence of our very existence, and tampering with them could bring about dire consequences.
> 
> These old records, hidden beneath the altar for who knows how long, resonate with a strange energy. It's as if the child who created that drawing had seen something profound and holy, something that we, even now, struggle to understand. The village has long been touched by mysteries, and it seems we are not the first to face this dark enigma hidden in the mountains."

   - **Clue 2:** A half-burned manuscript found in the village archives detailing the legend of the life lights.

> You sift through the dusty village archives, the dim light from a nearby window casting long shadows across the room. As you rummage through old scrolls and faded documents, your fingers brush against something brittle and charred. Carefully, you pull out a half-burned manuscript, its edges blackened and fragile.
> 
> The manuscript is old, its parchment yellowed and brittle with age. The writing, though faded in places, is still legible, penned in a neat but hurried script. As you read, the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. The text details a chilling legend, one that speaks of the life lights—ethereal flames said to hold the essence of a person’s life.
> 
> The manuscript recounts the story of a man who, in a time of great illness, sought out these life lights deep within the mountains. Guided by an old woman, he discovered a hidden vale where countless lights burned, each representing a human life. The legend tells of dark shapes moving among the lights, tending to them with a strange reverence.
> 
> As you read further, you find that the legend warns of the dire consequences of tampering with these lights. It speaks of how switching one’s light with another, particularly a child’s, could prolong one’s life but at a terrible cost. The child whose light was taken would perish, their life unnaturally cut short.
> 
> The manuscript’s final, charred pages hint at a ritual linked to these life lights, a dark practice believed to have caused mysterious deaths in the village centuries ago. The air in the room feels heavier as you absorb the implications of the text. The legend of the life lights is more than a mere folk tale; it is a warning, a shadowy history that seems to be repeating itself.
> 
> This discovery, this half-burned manuscript, resonates with an eerie truth, suggesting that the recent tragedies in the village are not isolated events but part of a recurring, dark pattern. The life lights, and the dark secrets they hold, are at the heart of the mystery you must unravel.

   - **Rumor 3:** The villagers speak of a mysterious stranger (Lukas) who arrived before the deaths started, suggesting he knows more than he reveals.

     1. "I saw Lukas speaking to Frau Ursula late at night, whispering secrets."
     2. "Lukas never stays in one place for long, always moving like a shadow."
     3. "He appeared just before the first child fell ill. Coincidence? I think not."
     4. "They say Lukas carries strange amulets and charms from far-off lands."
     5. "Lukas was seen near the old path to the mountains the night before the last child died."
     6. "No one knows where Lukas comes from, and he won’t say why he’s here."
     7. "Lukas always seems to know more about the old legends than the rest of us."
     8. "I've heard Lukas muttering to himself about life and death when he thinks no one is listening."
     9. "Lukas’ eyes... there’s something unsettling about the way he looks at you."

### Village Overview
In the mid-15th century, Schattenwald is a small Alpine village in Switzerland with a population of 273 people. Schattenwald is a tightly-knit community,  self-sufficient, with most inhabitants engaged in farming, animal husbandry, and various local crafts. The population size has fluctuated over the past centuries, but has never exceeded 302 souls.  The population fluctuation is influenced by the village's capacity to sustain its people through agriculture, livestock, and the natural resources available in the mountainous region.

In the mid-15th century village of Schattenwald, the livelihood of the villagers is closely tied to the land and the animals they raise. Here are detailed descriptions of farming and animal husbandry practices in the village:

#### Farming

1. **Crop Cultivation:**
   - The villagers grow a variety of crops suited to the alpine climate. Common crops include barley, rye, oats, and hardy vegetables such as turnips and cabbage.
   - Fields are small and scattered, carved out of the mountainside with terraces to prevent soil erosion.
   - Farming tools are simple yet effective, including wooden plows pulled by oxen, sickles for harvesting, and spades for digging.

2. **Seasonal Activities:**
   - **Spring:** The ground is thawed and prepared for planting. Seeds are sown in neat rows, and the villagers work together to ensure all fields are planted in time.
   - **Summer:** Crops are tended, weeds are pulled, and irrigation channels are maintained. The growing season is short, so every sunny day is precious.
   - **Autumn:** Harvest time is a busy period, with everyone pitching in to gather the crops. Grains are threshed and stored, vegetables are preserved for the long winter ahead.
   - **Winter:** Fields lie fallow, covered in snow. Villagers repair tools, mend fences, and prepare for the next growing season.

3. **Horticulture:**
   - Small kitchen gardens are maintained near each house, providing herbs, berries, and medicinal plants. Frau Ursula's garden is particularly renowned for its variety of healing herbs.
   - Fruit trees, such as apple and pear, are scattered throughout the village, providing fresh fruit in late summer and autumn.

#### Animal Husbandry

1. **Cattle:**
   - Cattle are a crucial part of village life, providing milk, meat, and leather. They are also used as draft animals to pull plows and carts.
   - During the summer, cattle are driven to higher pastures in the mountains, where the grass is lush. This practice, known as transhumance, helps keep the lower fields fertile.

2. **Sheep:**
   - Sheep are raised for their wool, which is spun into yarn and woven into cloth. Sheep also provide meat and milk.
   - The villagers practice shearing in late spring, carefully collecting the wool to be cleaned and processed.

3. **Goats:**
   - Goats are hardy animals that thrive in the rocky terrain of the Alps. They provide milk, which is often turned into cheese.
   - Goats are also valuable for their meat and their ability to graze on steep, difficult-to-reach slopes.

4. **Poultry:**
   - Chickens, ducks, and geese are kept for their eggs and meat. They roam freely around the village, foraging for insects and scraps.
   - Eggs are an important source of protein, and feathers are used for bedding and clothing.

5. **Swine:**
   - Pigs are raised for their meat, which is preserved through salting and smoking to provide sustenance during the winter months.
   - Pigs are usually kept in small pens near the village, fed on kitchen scraps and foraged acorns.

6. **Horses and Donkeys:**
   - Horses and donkeys are used for transportation and heavy labor. They are essential for moving goods and people across the rugged terrain.
   - These animals are well-cared for, as they play a vital role in the daily life and economy of the village.

#### Seasonal Activities in Animal Husbandry:

- **Spring:** Young animals are born, and the villagers ensure they are well-fed and healthy. Herds are moved to fresh pastures.
- **Summer:** Animals graze in high pastures, and villagers make hay to feed them during the winter. Wool is spun and cheese is made.
- **Autumn:** Animals are brought back to the village, and preparations are made for the cold months. Meat is preserved, and shelter is provided for all livestock.
- **Winter:** Animals are kept in barns and stables, fed on stored hay and grains. The villagers ensure their livestock stay warm and healthy through the harsh weather.

In Schattenwald, farming and animal husbandry are not just livelihoods but a way of life, deeply connected to the rhythms of nature and the changing seasons. These practices sustain the village and form the backbone of its culture and traditions.

Here are some common crafts and trades that villagers from Schattenwald engage in:

### Village Description

You find yourself in the quaint village of Schattenwald, nestled in a secluded valley in the Swiss Alps. The air is crisp, and the mountains loom tall and majestic, their peaks often shrouded in mist. The village, though small, is alive with history and tradition. Its heraldry features a silver stag leaping over a blue river, set against a green background, symbolizing the harmony between the villagers and their natural surroundings.

### Major Set Pieces

#### Central Square
The Central Square is the heart of Schattenwald. Cobblestone paths converge here, forming a spacious open area where villagers gather for markets and communal events. Stalls line the square, offering goods from fresh produce and cheese to handmade crafts. In the center stands a stone fountain, its water crystal clear and cool, providing refreshment for villagers and their animals alike. On market days, the square bustles with activity, the air filled with the sounds of haggling and laughter.

#### Church
The village church, a sturdy stone structure, sits at the north end of the Central Square. Its steeple reaches towards the sky, and a bell rings out across the valley, calling the faithful to worship. Inside, the church is dimly lit by stained glass windows depicting scenes of saints and local legends. Father Johann, the village priest, tends to his flock here, offering spiritual guidance and conducting services. The church also holds a small archive of village records.

#### Ursula’s Cottage
On the outskirts of the village, surrounded by a garden of herbs and wildflowers, stands Frau Ursula’s cottage. The walls are adorned with talismans and bundles of dried herbs hang from the eaves. The interior is cluttered but cozy, filled with the scent of various potions and the soft glow of candles. Shelves lined with jars of herbs and old books give the cottage an air of mystery. Frau Ursula is often found here, ready to provide her wisdom and remedies to those in need.

#### Hans and Greta’s House
Hans and Greta’s house, a humble abode, stands in a quieter part of the village. The home is modest, with wooden beams and a thatched roof. Inside, it is filled with reminders of their lost child—a small bed, toys neatly arranged, and a locket with the child’s picture. The atmosphere is somber, heavy with grief. Hans’ carpentry tools are neatly arranged in one corner, while Greta’s herbs and simple remedies occupy another.

#### Village Leader’s House
The largest home in Schattenwald belongs to Herr Klaus, the village leader. This sturdy, well-built house reflects his status and responsibility. It has a stone foundation and strong wooden beams. Inside, the rooms are spacious and well-furnished, with maps and village records neatly organized in his study. Herr Klaus often holds meetings here, planning for the village’s needs and addressing the concerns of his people.

#### Tavern
The village tavern, a warm and welcoming place, is where villagers gather to share news and stories. The wooden structure is sturdy and well-maintained, with a thatched roof and a sign depicting a frothy mug of ale. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of hearty stew and the sound of cheerful chatter. A large hearth provides warmth, and long tables invite patrons to sit and relax. The tavern keeper, a jovial man named Bernd, always has a tale to tell and an ear for the latest gossip.

#### Forest Path
Leading out of the village into the dense forest, the Forest Path is a narrow, winding trail. The trees grow tall and close here, their branches forming a canopy overhead that filters the sunlight. The path is well-trodden but can be treacherous, especially in bad weather. It leads deeper into the wilderness, towards the mountains where the sanctuary of lights is said to be hidden. The forest is alive with the sounds of wildlife, and the air is fresh and invigorating, though there is an eerie feeling that lingers as you walk this path.
