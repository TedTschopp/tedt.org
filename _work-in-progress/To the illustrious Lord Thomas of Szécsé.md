To the illustrious Lord Thomas of Szécsényi, personal representative of the serene Prince Lord Matthias, King of Hungary, Bohemia, etc., King of the Romans, etc., Chancellor of the Duchy. The preface of Master Johannes de Thurocz in the book of the Chronicles of Hungary happily begins.

In the first year of his reign, the noble and illustrious king faced various hardships. Different regions and orders gathered in meetings and assemblies to deal with urgent matters, but the invincible power of the king brought everything to order. Thus, Hungary began to flourish. The lands were defended, and peace was restored in all parts. In many regions, the king's efforts brought back prosperity.

However, the records and memories of the ancient Hungarian kings were scattered and forgotten. This wise and noble king, desirous of preserving the glorious deeds of his ancestors, ordered that the chronicles be written down in the most careful manner. Such was the king's reverence for history that he sought to emulate the valorous deeds of his predecessors. The king's victories were recorded, and the deeds of his forebears were no longer lost in the shadows of time.

In addition, the king sought the guidance of scholars and historians to ensure the accuracy of these records. He summoned learned men from various parts of his kingdom, and together they compiled a comprehensive account of Hungarian history. The chronicles were enriched with details of battles, noble acts, and the lineage of kings.

Therefore, by the grace of God and the king's diligence, the history of Hungary was preserved for future generations. The king's reign was marked by wisdom, strength, and the glory of his ancestors. His efforts ensured that the noble heritage of Hungary would not be forgotten.

Greek authors have reported that the Trojans destroyed Ilium; the great Alexander brought ruin to the Persians and conquered them; the Romans likewise subjugated nearly the whole world. The Scythians were the first to launch an attack; the kings of Hungary, however, have been celebrated for their great deeds and worthy achievements. These kings, illustrious for their exploits, have been chronicled by many writers. If these records had been neglected by writers, they would have remained obscure. The great deeds of our ancestors would have been consigned to oblivion, had not writers with their delightful eloquence revealed them to us. Therefore, I, a servant of the royal majesty, am compelled to bring forth the greatness of our kings into the light of history, so that their heroic deeds might be known to future generations. With divine assistance, I shall strive to present their noble acts in a clear and truthful manner.

I recall that in the time of Ludovicus, a great king, many events of notable significance occurred. During his reign, the Scythians were subdued, and peace reigned in the land. In the venerable annals of history, it is recorded that he conducted himself with great wisdom and justice. His language was moderate, and his deeds were just. I, therefore, humbly undertake the task of compiling these chronicles, relying on the assistance of learned men. I present this work to you, illustrious reader, with the hope that it may provide a faithful account of our history.

In ancient times, the annals of our history have described the great deeds of the kings of Hungary. This work, drawn from ancient sources, records the illustrious deeds of our ancestors. Among the most notable kings was Karolus, whose reign was marked by many memorable events. I, therefore, have endeavored to collect these accounts with great care, so that the glory of our past may not fade into obscurity. The chronicles contained in this volume aim to shed light on the noble deeds of our forefathers, for the benefit of future generations.

Thus, in this volume of the chronicles, the pages recount the great deeds and noble acts of our kings. In declaring these events, I have taken great care to present the truth with utmost fidelity. May this work stand as a testament to the enduring legacy of our kings and their glorious achievements. I dedicate this humble effort to the glory of God and the honor of our nation.

Just as the flesh of Noah and his sons, namely Shem, Ham, and Japheth, received a new generation: likewise, the universal Christian religion was born, and the illustrious Hungarian nation was exalted. Therefore, in this volume, I aim to declare their generations, for it is necessary to write about them. As I write this, I humbly follow my predecessors and place the accounts of the kings in the first part of this chronicle of Hungary.

These are the generations of Noah: Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After the flood, their descendants spread across the earth, each according to his tribe and nation.

The generations of Shem settled in Asia; Ham's descendants in Africa; Japheth's in Europe. The sons of Shem included Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The descendants of these tribes spread widely. The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Their descendants occupied the regions around the Mediterranean and the Scythian lands.

From the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah; from the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. These tribes established their settlements across the various regions of the world.

Thus, the descendants of Noah spread far and wide, establishing great kingdoms and empires. The ancient historians recorded these events to preserve the memory of these mighty nations for future generations.

Therefore, I, with great humility, present these chronicles, so that the noble deeds and origins of the Hungarian kings may be known. May the glory of their lineage be preserved and their legacy endure through the ages.

And thus, it is said that Brutus came before the Hebrews to the city of Jerusalem. But this happened before the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel. The sons of Ham are Cush, from whom the Ethiopians are descended; Mizraim, from whom the Egyptians are descended; Phut, from whom the Libyans are descended; and Canaan, from whom the Canaanites are descended, whose land was later divided among the sons of Shem.

The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. Cush also begot Nimrod, who was the first to become a mighty man on earth. Nimrod was a great hunter before the Lord; hence it is said, 'Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.'

The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. From that land, he went forth to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.

Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.

Canaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, and the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. Afterward, the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. The territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon, as one goes toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as one goes toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.

These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.

Shem's sons were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Arphaxad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.

Two sons were born to Eber: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. Their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.

These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.

These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these, the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.

... should build a temple, but many centuries later the Assyrians, having been defeated by the Hebrew king, turned to their own memorials, and by human sacrifice, they imitated those divine things. We, however, set forth the chronicles of their kings and priests in many books. Many peoples, both in the land and elsewhere, follow our teachings.

The writer should consider how this age, neglecting the origins of the priests and nobles, may obscure the truth. The tower of pride which was being raised from the earth to heaven, to which the builders gave names as wide as the earth and as tall as the sky, stretching towards the heavens, was to be avoided.

Assur left the land of Shinar, and the Assyrians established their own empire. They, however, followed the customs of the Hebrews and set up altars for sacrifices. Therefore, as the Hebrews had seen it done, they built these memorials. Therefore, the men of this nation are called Assyrians after Assur.

The generations of Noah's sons were divided according to their tongues and lands, each according to its own nation. As it is written: "These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations. And from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood."

These are the generations of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore, it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord." The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. From that land, he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.

The inhabitants of the region where they settled were known as Assyrians. Therefore, many believe that they are the descendants of Shem. But if we follow the story of the Hebrews, they descend from Ham, the son who saw his father's nakedness and did not cover him, for which he was cursed by his father. Therefore, the Assyrians are also called the sons of Shem and the sons of Ham.

These generations are recounted in many chronicles, and the story of Nimrod is repeated. He was the first king to rule the Assyrians. They inhabited the land near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. His kingdom spread across these lands and beyond.

This is the story of the origins of the Assyrians, who were also known by other names in various regions. The chronicles of the oriental nations tell of their history.

Enoch begot Irad. Irad begot Mehujael. Mehujael begot Methushael. Methushael begot Lamech. Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

Another chapter of the same story.

In those days, the Nephilim were on the earth, and also afterward, when the sons of God came into the daughters of man, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them." But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

Noah and the Flood

These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.

And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks. For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. Also, take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them." Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
