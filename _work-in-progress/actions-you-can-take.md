#### Pass Down Knowledge or Skill

"Learning is an ornament in prosperity, a refuge in adversity, and a provision in old age." – Aristotle

As your character's journey progresses, they accumulate a wealth of knowledge and skills, some of which become defining aspects of their identity. However, there comes a time when sharing this knowledge becomes as important as acquiring it. The "Pass Down Knowledge or Skill" activity allows your character to impart their expertise to a younger or less experienced individual, shaping their future and extending your character's influence.

When engaging in this activity, envision whom your character would choose as their protégé. It might be a young adventurer thirsty for knowledge, a member of your community eager to learn a trade, or perhaps a relative looking to follow in your footsteps. This transfer of wisdom can take many forms: a series of intensive training sessions, the crafting of a detailed manuscript, or even a long-term mentorship.

##### Rules for Passing Down Knowledge or Skill

To successfully pass down your knowledge or skill, select the specific area of expertise you wish to impart. This can be a skill your character is proficient in, a piece of lore they have uncovered, or a unique technique they have mastered.

   - **Success**: If the skill checks are successful, your protégé gains a basic understanding or proficiency in the skill or knowledge area. This can manifest as a bonus in their future skill checks related to this area.
   - **Partial Success**: If the skill checks yield mixed results, the protégé gains some insight but may need further training to fully grasp the skill or knowledge.
   - **Failure**: Should the skill checks fail, the training does not produce the desired outcome, but the attempt may still foster a bond between your character and the protégé, leading to future roleplaying opportunities.

4. **Long-term Impact**: Reflect on how this transfer of knowledge impacts both your character and their protégé. It's a chance for character growth, establishing new relationships, and potentially shaping future events in the game world.

Remember, this activity isn't just about the transfer of skills; it's about the legacy your character is building and the bonds they forge along the way.

#### Name an Heir - to fix

"In his will he hath bequeathed to you his mansion, his plate, his money and his lands." - William Shakespeare, "Much Ado About Nothing"

An heir isn't just someone who inherits your belongings; they are a person in whom you see a fragment of yourself, a successor to continue your battle against the forces of darkness. Initially, the heir is a non-player character, but they will become a playable character if and when you leave the story for any reason.

When you choose this undertaking, you must name an heir and note it on your character sheet. You immediately gain 1 point of Hope, representing your aspirations for your heir's future. Conversely, if your chosen heir meets an unfortunate end, you instantly receive 4 Shadow points.

This choice is a one-time event; you can't name another heir later.

#### Name an Heir - Fixed

"Legacy is not leaving something for people. It's leaving something in people." – Peter Strople

The "Name an Heir" activity allows your character to designate a successor, a symbolic and literal passing of the torch to a new generation. This heir, chosen for their potential to embody and continue your character’s legacy, becomes a significant figure in your narrative, embodying your character's hopes and values. The act of naming an heir is not just about bequeathing material possessions but is a profound statement of trust and expectation, a hope that your battles and beliefs will live on.

##### Rules for Naming an Heir

1. **Selection of the Heir**: When you decide to name an heir, consider who in the game world embodies aspects of your character’s spirit and values. This person becomes more than a mere recipient of material wealth; they are the continuation of your character’s story.

2. **Formalizing the Heir**:
   - **Recording the Choice**: Officially name your chosen heir on your character sheet. This act signifies a deep bond and a significant shift in your character’s narrative.
   - **Hope and Responsibility**: Upon naming the heir, your character gains 1 point of Hope, reflecting the optimism and aspirations placed in the heir’s future.

3. **Impact of the Heir’s Fate**:
   - If the chosen heir suffers an unfortunate fate, your character is deeply affected, receiving 4 Shadow points. This represents the emotional and psychological impact of losing someone you envisioned as a key part of your legacy.

4. **Irrevocability of the Decision**:
   - The choice to name an heir is a one-time event. Once made, it cannot be undone or altered. This irrevocability adds weight and significance to the decision, making it a pivotal moment in your character’s story.

5. **Legacy and Continuity**:
   - The heir, initially a non-player character, has the potential to become a playable character if your current character exits the story for any reason. This transition can create a seamless narrative link between characters and generations within the game.

Naming an heir in the game is a powerful and character-defining choice. It's an opportunity to explore themes of legacy, hope, and the continuation of ideals beyond a single character's lifetime, adding depth and continuity to the storytelling experience.

##### To Fix

###### Family Heritage

Upon designating an heir, you have the opportunity to pass on one of your favored skills as a family inheritance. This skill should truly embody who you are, based on both gameplay and personal preference.

Should you retire or meet an untimely end, your heir inherits this skill as an additional favored skill. Moreover, whenever the heir employs this inherited skill, a single special die roll results in an extraordinary success.

###### Heirloom

You can also earmark a singularly wondrous artifact or a renowned weapon or armor to pass onto your heir.

The heir can claim this legacy item as a reward when their level of bravery allows it. Notably, any latent abilities within weapons or armor become automatically activated when claimed by the heir. In the case of wondrous artifacts, any hidden blessings are revealed when the heir takes possession of it.

These legacy items can never be exchanged to boost your social standing or be replaced by similar items; they are more than just objects. They are sacred legacies, intended to be passed down to a worthy successor and not discarded lightly.

###### Sombre Legacy

The burden of continuing a loved one's mission is heavy. Your heir starts their journey carrying 1 permanent Shadow point for each flaw you possessed at the time of your retirement or death
