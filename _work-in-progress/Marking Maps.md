### 1. The Start of the Level Should Present Interesting Choices or Look Impressive

As you embark on designing the start of your TTRPG adventure, especially for smaller dungeons, your foremost task is to immediately captivate your players. Picture the first room as the opening chapter of a grand tale, where every element is a hook that reels in the curiosity of your adventurers. Imagine placing an enigmatic statue that whispers ancient lore, a locked door to the east veiled in shadow, and an open arch to the west, bathed in light, revealing a tantalizing object or feature.

In the realm of pen-and-paper, conjuring an "impressive" visual spectacle can be a challenge, so your words must paint the scenery. Weave descriptions that are rich in fantasy and set the thematic tone for your adventure. Let your players feel the crackling energy of a magical aura, hear the distant echo of a mysterious melody, and see the intricate patterns on ancient walls.

Remember, in the world of TTRPGs, offering "interesting choices" or creating an "interesting look" are equally vital. Rather than just describing vast, sweeping landscapes, focus on creating environments that beckon to be interacted with. This method draws players into a dance with their surroundings, deepening their immersion and enriching their experience. Encourage them to touch the cool, moss-covered walls, listen to the subtle creaking of an old wooden door, and smell the musty air of a long-forgotten chamber. These interactive elements breathe life into your world and open doors to creative problem-solving and impactful decision-making from the outset.

- **Overland Maps**: Envision the starting location as a crossroads, a junction of fate, where paths diverge towards mystical forests, towering mountains, and tranquil lakes. Each route is an invitation to a different adventure, offering your players the freedom to choose their journey.
  
- **City Maps**: The gateway to your city should be nothing short of magnificent, whether it's a grandiose gate with elaborate carvings that tell a thousand stories, lively marketplaces buzzing with the chatter of townsfolk, or shadowy alleys shrouded in mystery, each corner unfolding a different facet of urban life.
  
- **Dungeon Maps**: The threshold of your dungeon could be a nexus of possibilities, with corridors stretching into the unknown or a majestic hall adorned with relics that whisper of ancient secrets and untold riches, enticing the brave to venture further.
  
- **Building Maps**: In the lobby, let there be a tapestry of history or a puzzle that unravels the building's past, a silent challenge to those who dare to decipher its secrets, promising revelations of hidden stories and forgotten epochs.
  
- **Cave Maps**: The mouth of the cave opens to a world beneath the world, a cavernous expanse with myriad tunnels each leading to its own mystery, or a serene underground lake reflecting the echoes of an unseen depth, beckoning the explorers to discover its hidden paths.
  
- **Space Maps**: Begin at a space station, a hub of interstellar travel, where each dock is a portal to different corners of the cosmos. Here, the players face choices that could take them to distant galaxies, unknown planets, or into the heart of a nebula, each decision a step into the vast unknown.

In each of these settings, your role is to craft an opening scene that not only intrigues but also offers a glimpse into the wonders and perils that lie ahead. Let every choice and detail in your map ignite the imagination of your players, setting them on a path of adventure, mystery, and unparalleled discovery.

Corey |


### 2. The Start of the Level Should Fit Its Purpose

When you weave the tapestry of your TTRPG adventure, particularly at the onset of your dungeons or levels, it's essential to be deliberate in how you lay the groundwork. Imagine yourself as the architect of worlds, where every transition, especially in nuanced settings like the shift from the crypts to their moldier, more ominous counterparts, is a stroke of your creative brush. Think beyond mere physical depth; envision the sensory journey - the creeping chill of dampness seeping into the bones, the heavy air tainted with the stench of decay, and the visible transformation of walls from etched stone to moss-laden, moisture-slick surfaces.

Especially for starter adventures, set the stage with scenarios that demand choice, instantly drawing your players into the fabric of the world you've spun. These decisions should be the keys that unlock the narrative, setting the tone for the challenges and opportunities they will encounter. Whether it‚Äôs a crossroad that beckons with whispers of legend or a moral quandary posed by a mysterious character, these choices should deeply root your players in the reality of the adventure.

- **Overland Maps**: Should your aim be to guide and educate, let the journey begin in a tranquil area adorned with landmarks and signs, a haven that whispers guidance. If peril is what you seek to instill, let the starting point be a treacherous cliff's edge or the border of a realm ruled by beasts of legend, where every rustle in the dark is a heartbeat of danger.

- **City Maps**: For a serene start, imagine the bustling life of a prosperous district, where the clink of coins and the laughter of the market set a buoyant mood. In contrast, a darker beginning could be in the labyrinthine slums, rife with whispers of hauntings, or near a house that breathes with tales of the spectral.

- **Dungeon Maps**: In a tutorial-like beginning, envisage a corridor free of traps yet rich with inscriptions that whisper hints and lore, a gentle guide in a world of mystery. For a more treacherous onset, plunge your players into an abyss of darkness, where the unknown lurks in every shadow, and danger hums in the silent air.

- **Building Maps**: For an educational start, let the lobby be awash with light, its walls adorned with plaques and paintings that narrate its history. If it's a sense of dread you wish to evoke, start in a dim, forsaken part of the building, where every creak and groan tells tales of forgotten days and lurking fears.

- **Cave Maps**: A safe beginning might be a cave entrance caressed by sunlight, its stable grounds a reassuring embrace. On the other hand, a passage shrouded in darkness, echoing with the sounds of unseen creatures, sets a tone of suspense and veiled threats.

- **Space Maps**: Begin with a space station aglow with knowledge, its corridors lined with guides and mentors for an educational start. Or, throw your players amidst a meteor storm or a sector notorious for pirates for a start that thrums with adrenaline and the unknown.

In each of these beginnings, remember, your task is to create a world that responds, that changes and evolves with each decision made by your players. Let their choices be the compass that guides their journey, making their experience in your world not just a game, but a saga they live and breathe from the very first step.

### 3. Reuse Areas in the Level

As you craft the realms of your TTRPG adventure, consider the profound impact of reusing areas within your levels. Picture your dungeon not just as a series of rooms and corridors, but as a living, breathing labyrinth, one that beckons players to unravel its mysteries time and again. This familiarity becomes an intricate thread in the fabric of your gameplay, transforming the space from mere walls and floors into a character in its own right.

Encourage your players to navigate this labyrinth repeatedly, where each return is not a retread but a deeper dive into its secrets. With each visit, let them discover which paths hold danger and which corridors hide shortcuts, turning their growing knowledge into a powerful tool. This intimate understanding of the dungeon's layout, its hidden nooks, and peculiarities transforms their journey into a strategic dance through a world that evolves with them.

Remember, an area that is revisited and known becomes a home ground for players, giving them a sense of belonging and mastery. This approach transforms the experience from a mere exploration into a strategic conquest, preventing your creation from feeling shallow or transient.

Imagine mapping a complex dungeon or a sprawling region over time. The players‚Äô engagement intensifies as they see their actions and choices shape the environment. They feel an authentic connection to the setting, making each adventure not just a quest but a chapter in a grand tale that they help weave.

- **Overland Maps**: Envision a central town or a significant landmark that becomes a familiar haven for players after their ventures into wild terrains. This town, with its welcoming taverns and familiar faces, becomes a canvas on which players paint their stories of exploration.

- **City Maps**: Create a central plaza or an iconic landmark, like a majestic fountain or a statue steeped in lore. This plaza, alive with the pulse of the city, bustling markets, or the whispers of clandestine meetings, becomes a crossroad of countless tales and decisions.

- **Dungeon Maps**: Design a central chamber that serves not just as a junction of paths but as a sanctuary of sorts. Here, amidst the echoing halls, players can rest, plan their next foray, or unravel the mysteries they have gathered.

- **Building Maps**: Picture a main hallway or a grand atrium, its architecture telling the story of the building, connecting diverse wings and floors. This hallway, adorned with art or echoes of footsteps, becomes a thread linking different narratives within the structure.

- **Cave Maps**: Imagine a vast central cavern, a heart of the underground world, where multiple tunnels converge. This cavern, with its unique formations and echoes of dripping water, becomes a map within a map, a place of respite and decision.

- **Space Maps**: Think of a central space hub or a frequently visited planet, bustling with interstellar travelers and cosmic tales. This hub, a beacon in the vastness of space, becomes the anchor of your players' cosmic journey, a familiar sight in the ocean of stars.

In each of these settings, your role as a creator is to provide a world that evolves with the players, offering them a sense of ownership and deepening their connection to the adventure. Let these familiar spaces be more than just points on a map; let them be chapters of a story that grows richer with every visit, etching itself in the memories of those who traverse its paths.

### 4. Provide Contrast in Every Element

As you delve into the creation of your TTRPG adventure, embrace an aesthetic that weaves a tapestry of variety, rich in texture and color, rather than rigidly adhering to a realistic mimicry. Imagine, for instance, designing a tomb. It need not be a carbon copy of an ancient burial site; instead, let it echo the essence of a tomb, infused with elements that resonate with the theme of your story. Picture cryptic inscriptions on the walls, the air heavy with the scent of antiquity, and shadowed corners hiding secrets from ages past.

Your canvas is broad. Sprinkle your environment with a medley of features ‚Äì traps that whisper of ancient craftsmanship, puzzles that echo the clever minds of yore, artifacts that shimmer with forgotten magic, and details that paint the environment with layers of history and lore. Create spaces that are a symphony of the old and the new, familiar yet brimming with undiscovered mysteries, making each step an exploration, each turn a discovery.

In the realm of adversaries, diversity is your ally. Your foes should be more than mere obstacles; they should be characters that enrich your narrative, echoing the world you've crafted. Let your players encounter enemies that challenge them not just in battle but in wits and strategy, enemies that are integral to the story you're weaving. This approach ensures that each encounter is a thread in the larger tapestry of your adventure, contributing meaningfully to the unfolding saga.

- **Overland Maps**: Envision a world where the stark harshness of deserts contrasts with the lush embrace of forests. Let your players feel the scorch of the sun on the dunes and the cool shade under the canopy. Introduce weather patterns that change the landscape, from the howling winds of a storm to the serene calm of a clear day, and cycle through day and night, each bringing its own palette of colors and experiences.

- **City Maps**: Craft your city as a mosaic of districts, each with its own heartbeat. The opulence of the rich areas, with their polished facades and the aroma of exotic spices, stands in contrast to the gritty streets of poorer districts, where every alley tells a story. Fill the air with the cacophony of busy marketplaces and the hushed whispers of secluded parks.

- **Dungeon Maps**: Design your dungeons as a dance of light and shadow. Let your players wander through brightly lit halls adorned with menacing statues, only to find themselves in the suffocating embrace of dark corridors, where the silence is a presence of its own. Weave in sounds that unsettle ‚Äì a distant drip of water, a sudden rustle, an inexplicable whisper.

- **Building Maps**: Create buildings that are a celebration of architectural diversity. Imagine bright, bustling offices with the hum of modern machinery, leading to storerooms drowned in shadows and silence. Let the transition from one space to another be a journey through time and purpose.

- **Cave Maps**: Paint your caves as realms of contrast. Spacious caverns where the echoes of your footsteps reverberate against the walls, lead to narrow, claustrophobic passages where the air feels thick and the walls seem to close in. Balance the dry, dusty passages with the sound of trickling water in damp areas.

- **Space Maps**: In the vastness of space, juxtapose the void's silent, haunting emptiness with the vibrant life of space stations. Let the loneliness of the cosmos be contrasted with areas buzzing with alien life, the hum of machinery, and the glow of distant stars and nebulae.

In each setting, your role is to craft a world that is a feast for the senses, a place where every element tells a story, and every corner holds a secret waiting to be unraveled. Let your maps be more than mere locations; let them be worlds that invite your players to explore, experience, and remember.

| Space Maps    | Space maps should juxtapose the vastness of space with lively interstellar locations. | Contrast the serene void of space with vibrant, busy space stations and dynamic cosmic events.   | Avoid space maps that fail to contrast the emptiness of space with lively areas. | 'Star Wars' series, 'The Expanse' series by James S.A. Corey      |

### 5. Changes in Wall or Floor Texture Should Be Accompanied by a Height Change or Border Texture

As you weave the narrative tapestry of your TTRPG adventure, pay special attention to the art of transitioning between diverse aesthetic realms. It's crucial to create an environment where the progression and change are tangible, breathing life into the landscape. Imagine designing a world where starkly contrasting settings, such as a fiery hell pit adjacent to an opulent golden throne room, coexist. Your task is to create a bridge between these worlds, allowing players to traverse them seamlessly.

Envision transitional spaces ‚Äì perhaps a grand hallway or an atmospheric corridor ‚Äì that meld elements from both realms. Picture statues lining this passageway, their gold crowns and scepters half-melted, telling a story of opulence touched by infernal heat. Walls adorned with tapestries singed at the edges, each burn mark a silent testament to the fiery abyss nearby. This creative interplay of elements crafts a transition that is not just a physical journey but an emotional and sensory experience, immersing players deeper into the fabric of your world.

These transitions are more than mere pathways; they are narrative threads that bind the different aspects of your world, ensuring coherence and enhancing believability, even amidst the most fantastical settings. By thoughtfully designing these transitions, you don't just guide players from one place to another; you take them on a journey through a living, breathing world.

- **Overland Maps**: Imagine the gradual transformation of landscapes ‚Äì from lush, grassy plains to the stark beauty of sandy deserts. Signal this shift with a natural gradation of terrain, where verdant fields slowly give way to rolling dunes, or rocky outcrops herald the onset of arid lands.

- **City Maps**: Craft the transition from rustic cobblestone streets to an elegant town square with attention to detail. Visualize a series of steps leading up to the square, bordered by vibrant flower beds or statues that capture the essence of the city's history and culture.

- **Dungeon Maps**: In the depths of your dungeon, let a change in architecture mark the passage to new mysteries. A sudden drop from rough, hewn stone to meticulously laid tile floors, perhaps accented by an ornately carved archway, can signal a shift from the primitive to the civilized, the abandoned to the inhabited.

- **Building Maps**: Within the confines of a building, let the transition from a plush, carpeted office area to a sleek, tiled cafeteria be marked by subtle cues. A tasteful threshold or a gently sloping ramp not only serves a practical purpose but also visually and texturally distinguishes the two spaces.

- **Cave Maps**: In your subterranean world, let the transition from smooth cave floors to rugged, uneven terrain be marked by nature's own design. A sudden outcrop of jagged rocks or a change in elevation can signal to adventurers that they are venturing into untamed, perhaps dangerous, parts of the cave.

- **Space Maps**: In the vast expanse of a space station, use visual cues to differentiate between sectors. The residential area might be marked by warm, ambient lighting and soft, welcoming colors, while the industrial sector could be characterized by stark, practical lighting and utilitarian, color-coded lines.

In each of these environments, your transitions are not just physical barriers but narrative tools. They are opportunities to enhance your story, to add depth to your world, and to engage your players in an adventure that is as visually and emotionally rich as it is exciting. Let these transitions be the paintbrush with which you add color and texture to the canvas of your TTRPG world.

Corey          |


### 6. Include at Least Four Secrets in Your Level

As you delve into the creation of your TTRPG adventure, one of the most thrilling aspects to integrate is the inclusion of at least four secrets within your level. This time-honored technique, particularly beloved in games like D&D, brings a layer of depth and intrigue to your dungeons, transforming them into realms of enigma and discovery.

Go beyond the conventional hidden doors and secret compartments. Draw inspiration from the pioneers of TTRPG modules and classic computer games, where secrets often lay veiled behind other secrets, creating a multi-layered experience of revelation and wonder. Imagine embedding subtle audio cues in your world ‚Äì the faint sound of moving stone in a silent room, a mysterious melody that seems to come from nowhere, or the distant echo of rushing water, hinting at change and hidden activities whose sources are shrouded in mystery.

Envision scenarios where you tantalize your players with glimpses of their objectives ‚Äì a coveted relic seen through a window across a molten river of lava, or a door glowing with arcane runes, just out of reach. These teases build a tantalizing sense of mystery and challenge, prodding players to delve deeper into your world, to interact with their surroundings in a quest to uncover the hidden truths.

Remember, your secrets should be a rich tapestry of narrative elements. They could be cryptic riddles etched into ancient walls, puzzles that intertwine with the lore of your world, hidden passages that reveal long-forgotten tales, or unique artifacts whose origins are as intriguing as their powers.

- **City Maps**: Craft concealed alleyways that twist into the unknown, underground passages echoing with the whispers of the past, hidden rooftop entries that offer views into unseen parts of the city, and clandestine rooms within buildings, each holding stories untold.

- **Dungeon Maps**: Design secret chambers that hum with ancient magic, cunningly hidden traps ready to ensnare the unwary, doors that blend seamlessly with the walls, and treasure caches that reward the perceptive and the brave.

- **Building Maps**: Imagine secret offices behind bookshelves, safes tucked away behind unassuming portraits, architectural quirks that lead to forgotten parts of the building, and exclusive areas accessible only to those who know their secrets.

- **Cave Maps**: Hide precious mineral veins behind false rock faces, underground lakes that reflect starlight from unseen sources, secret tunnels that wind into the heart of the earth, and ancient inscriptions waiting to be deciphered by those versed in lost languages.

- **Space Maps**: Create hidden asteroid bases obscured by space debris, cloaked ships lying in wait, wormholes that serve as gateways to distant galaxies, and abandoned satellites that tell tales of forgotten space expeditions.

In each of these settings, let your secrets be the threads that weave together the fabric of your world, enticing players to unravel them. These hidden treasures, riddles, and pathways are not just challenges but invitations to your players, leading them on a journey filled with wonder, discovery, and the thrill of the unknown. Let your world be one where every corner holds a secret, every shadow a story, and every whisper a clue, creating an adventure that will linger in their memories long after the game is over.

### 7. When a Player Solves a Piece of a Puzzle, They Should Know Where to Go Next

As you weave the intricate web of puzzles and challenges in your TTRPG adventure, it's vital to ensure that your players immediately grasp the impact of their actions upon solving a puzzle. This approach is key to creating a game environment where every choice and action carries weight and clarity. It‚Äôs about painting a world where consequences are visible and meaningful, guiding players through the narrative like stars in the night sky.

When designing your puzzles, remember to lay out the challenge before its solution. This method is akin to storytelling ‚Äì the players must first understand the mystery or obstacle they face to appreciate and recognize the solution when it unfolds. It‚Äôs about crafting a narrative journey as much as a game.

For example, if a key is needed to unlock a door, let the players first encounter the door, shrouded in mystery and promise, its lock gleaming under the torchlight. This way, when they later find the key, its significance is immediately apparent, and the path forward is clear.

In every scenario, from the sprawling landscapes of overland maps to the cryptic corners of space maps, employ this principle to enhance the players' experience:

- **Overland Maps**: Imagine the thrill of discovering a fragment of a map, weathered and torn, pointing towards a new, unexplored location. Or coming across an ancient landmark, its stones whispering directions to a hidden destination.

- **City Maps**: Picture the players solving a riddle etched on a statue in a bustling square, the answer leading them to a key location, perhaps a forgotten building whose secrets are ripe for uncovering.

- **Dungeon Maps**: Create moments where finding a key becomes a triumphant resolution to the mystery of a locked door encountered earlier, each turn of the key a step deeper into the dungeon's heart.

- **Building Maps**: Design scenarios where deactivating a security system opens previously inaccessible floors, or finding an elevator code unlocks new vertical horizons within a towering structure.

- **Cave Maps**: Let the players follow geological clues or ancient carvings that beckon them deeper into the cavernous belly of the earth, each discovery a guidepost deeper into the subterranean mystery.

- **Space Maps**: Craft experiences where decrypting a star chart illuminates the path to new planets or hidden sectors, the stars themselves becoming a map to the cosmos.

In each of these scenarios, you‚Äôre not just creating a puzzle; you‚Äôre creating a moment of revelation, a nexus where story, challenge, and discovery converge. Each solved puzzle is a brushstroke in the grand painting of your adventure, a note in the symphony of your narrative. It‚Äôs about making the players feel that their actions are part of a larger story, a world that responds, evolves, and reveals itself with each of their decisions. Let your game be a journey of discovery, where each solved puzzle is a step further into the wonderous world you have created.

### 8. If an Area in Your Level Looks Like It Could Be Made in an Earlier Tech, You Have Failed

As you embark on the journey of designing areas in your TTRPG adventure, steer clear of the well-trodden path of outdated methods like random die rolls for area creation. Your aim is to craft an environment that captivates and engages, transcending the ordinary to achieve the extraordinary. Think of each area as a canvas, where the strokes of your imagination bring to life a world that is dynamic, vibrant, and full of surprises.

Innovate relentlessly. Break the mold of standard encounter tables; breathe life into new, fearsome creatures or whimsical allies that add a fresh twist to your narrative. Each room, each corridor should tell a story, not just serve as a backdrop. 

Reskinning existing elements can inject a surge of excitement into familiar settings. Picture transforming the mundane into the marvelous ‚Äì a simple skeleton becomes a sentinel of forgotten lore, its bones whispering tales of lost expeditions, or a guardian animated by ancient sorcery, protecting relics of untold power. This approach weaves a richer tapestry of narrative, making each encounter a story in itself.

- **Overland Maps**: Craft landscapes that are a symphony of varied terrain ‚Äì rolling hills that give way to jagged mountain peaks, lush forests bordering desolate wastelands. Infuse these lands with the lifeblood of weather effects and natural phenomena. Let your players feel the kiss of rain on a verdant meadow or the scorching heat of a desert sun, each element a character in your story.

- **City Maps**: Envision cities where architecture and infrastructure are echoes of the era. Let the buildings be more than structures; let them be storytellers. A Victorian mansion, its spires reaching into the sky; neon-lit skyscrapers of a cyberpunk future ‚Äì each should reflect the world's heartbeat.

- **Dungeon Maps**: Design dungeons where each trap and puzzle is a piece of the larger narrative puzzle. Shun the outdated and the clich√©d. Let the walls of your dungeons hold intricate mechanisms that challenge the mind and spirit, each room a unique encounter that aligns with the overarching theme.

- **Building Maps**: Within the confines of your buildings, let the interior design speak of the times. Contemporary offices with sleek technology, echoing the pulse of modernity; ancient libraries, their shelves heavy with leather-bound tomes, whispering of times long past.

- **Cave Maps**: Create caves that are a marvel of geological diversity. Shimmering stalactites in one chamber, rugged, unyielding rock in another. Each formation tells a story, each mineral vein a path to hidden treasures or perilous depths.

- **Space Maps**: In the boundless realm of space, let your features be as limitless. Space stations buzzing with intergalactic activity, planets with richly detailed ecosystems, and celestial phenomena that leave players in awe. Every star, every nebula should be a testament to the wonders of the universe.

In each of these settings, your role is to be more than a creator; you are a weaver of worlds. Let your imagination be boundless, your creativity limitless. Craft experiences that are not just played but lived, where every detail is a thread in the vibrant tapestry of your adventure. Make your TTRPG not just a game, but a journey into a world that thrills, challenges, and inspires.
