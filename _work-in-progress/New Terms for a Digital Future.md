### 🧷 Techniques of **Digital Serfdom**

#### 1. **Subscription Slavery**

> Renting access to tools, content, or even appliances, ensuring perpetual dependence without ownership or exit.

#### 2. **Platform Prisons**

> Platforms that prevent data export, integration, or interoperability—forcing users to stay inside proprietary ecosystems under threat of data loss or fragmentation.

#### 3. **Surveillance Capitalism**

> Monetizing every click, scroll, or whisper—users pay with their behavior, privacy, and autonomy instead of money.

#### 4. **Algorithmic Gatekeeping**

> Machine-driven prioritization of visibility, success, or even survival—your reach, earnings, or access is decided by opaque systems you can’t appeal.

#### 5. **Dark Pattern Design**

> Manipulative UX tactics that nudge users into actions against their best interests: subscriptions, sharing data, or accepting tracking.

#### 6. **Digital Debt Traps**

> Microtransactions, gamified spending, and AI-driven personalization designed to extract recurring revenue far beyond the service’s real value.

#### 7. **Closed Device Ecosystems**

> Hardware that only works within tightly controlled environments (Apple, for example), locking users into single-vendor loyalty and surveillance.

#### 8. **Licensing Over Ownership**

> You don't *own* your software, your books, your movies, or your tools—you license access, and that license can be revoked or modified without consent.

#### 9. **Content Monetization Lock-In**

> Creators build entire livelihoods on platforms (YouTube, Substack, Twitch) they don’t own—where demonetization or deplatforming can erase everything overnight.

#### 10. **Shadow Pricing**

> AI-determined pricing based on your behavior, demographics, or desperation—an invisible, exploitative toll for digital access.

#### 11. **Digital Redlining**

> Geographic or demographic exclusion via algorithmic bias, keeping certain users from services, deals, or even job offers based on hidden profiling.

#### 12. **Synthetic Scarcity**

> NFTs, artificial waitlists, or token-gated access that create false exclusivity in digital spaces—turning abundance into controlled access.

#### 13. **Forced Obsolescence**

> Software or hardware updates that deliberately degrade performance, pushing users to repurchase or upgrade repeatedly.
