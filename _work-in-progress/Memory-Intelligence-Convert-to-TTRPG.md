**Intro**

There are six levels or types of thinking that every student or learner of any age should master. Each of these six levels leads to a different level of result. Unfortunately, most of the students I work with are stuck in these first few levels of thinking. The reason they struggle to reach top results is that they are thinking at the wrong level. When this happens, it causes a lot of stress, wastes a lot of time, and can be very frustrating. It feels impossible to reach top results with any degree of confidence. Over time, we might start thinking that maybe we're just not cut out for it, but that probably isn't true.

For me, learning how to think deliberately at the right level is one of the main reasons I was able to achieve top academic results in both medical school and for my Master of Education. Trust me, I'm certainly not a genius. I've seen similar results with thousands of students and professionals that I've trained over the years. By the end of this video, you'll be able to see what level you tend to operate at and how you can get to the level you need to be. FYI, the level you need to be at is probably higher than you think, but we'll get to that later.

**Level 1: Remember**

The first level is all about memorizing things. This involves a lot of rereading and rewriting. It is usually very repetitive, can feel very tedious, and often makes us feel drowsy. This level is called "Remember." It is the level of rote learning and repeating hundreds and thousands of flashcards. This is the way I, and maybe you, studied for most of high school. It's maybe the reason why you might have hated studying. When you do this level of thinking and studying, it unlocks level one result, which is "Regurgitate."

The regurgitate level is all about listing, defining, and stating facts. It's the kind of questions that are less common as you go through university and become semi-useless in professional life. Confusingly, even though this first level is called "Remember," it's actually not a very good way to hold on to and retain the things that you learn. But we'll talk about that later.

**Level 2: Understand**

The second level of learning is about really trying to comprehend what you are learning rather than just repeatedly smashing it into your brain. This is the level that we call "Understand." There's a reason I've been saying these are levels of thinking and not different levels of studying. That's because your intentions really matter. You could have two people doing exactly the same technique, and for someone looking at you, it can look exactly the same. When you ask them, "Hey, how are you studying?" they might both just say, "I'm just reading my textbook." But mentally, it's different.

For the person at level one, by reading, they actually mean, "I'm reading it again and again so I can try to get it stuck in my head." Whereas for the person at level two, what they mean is, "I'm reading it so I can understand what it's trying to say and wrap my head around it." So naturally, at level two thinking "Understand," we unlock level two result, which is "Explain." This allows us to answer questions that require us to explain our understanding of a concept or a process. These types of questions often make up the bulk of most assessments until around later in university.

**Level 3: Apply**

Level three is about using what you have learned to then solve problems. This is the level that we call "Apply." This is where things can get a little bit confusing because a lot of people misunderstand this about Bloom's taxonomy. There are lots of different ways that you can apply your knowledge to solve problems. For example, you have what I would say are simple problems. These are the types of problems where you learn something and then you just directly use that thing that you learned to solve a problem. So, for example, in math or physics, you learn an equation or formula, and there is a problem that you need to solve by just using that equation or formula.

Then again, there are what I might call a little bit more advanced problems. These are the ones where you actually have to think about the best way to tackle the problem. There are a combination of concepts that you need to apply in a certain sequence, and there's a lot more strategic thinking involved. At level three, we are mostly talking about the first one: simple problem solving. We unlock that level, which is the simple problem-solving result. We're now able to solve what I call one-to-one problems, where there is one concept you learn and the problem requires that one concept to solve. You can get to this level, level three, by just literally solving questions and solving problems. Lots of practice papers and quizzes have questions at the apply level. For something more procedural, like coding, it might be building a simple function with a few simple variables.

**Level 4: Analyze**

What about the harder and more complex questions, the types of problems that are advanced? This is where level four thinking comes in. We're entering into the territory of higher-order learning. People who know how to think at level four tend to do pretty well, but level four thinkers are not common, and you'll see why that is soon. Level four thinking is all about comparing and contrasting. It's about looking for similarities and differences. We call this level "Analyze." It's the first time that we're not just looking at information by itself, but we're looking at it in relation to another piece of information.

There are countless techniques that help with level four analyze: Venn diagrams, making tables, making summaries that explain the similarities and differences, using mind maps. In problems and questions that force you to compare one concept in relation to another, all of these things are going to be helpful. Really, any technique is effective as long as it forces you to compare and contrast one thing against another thing. Unlocking level four accesses the level four result, which is the comparison level.

Instead of just giving you some examples of what comparison looks like, I'm going to do one better and show you this great little study tip that you can use. Go on to something like ChatGPT or Gemini and type in this prompt: "Give me questions at the educational stage that you want," so let's say second-year university level, for the subject, so let's say in this example we'll say microbiology, at Bloom's revised taxonomy level. In this case, it's going to be level four. These are exactly the types of questions that test you at level four, and you'll see that every single option forces you to compare ideas against each other.

The reason this technique is actually useful to use in your studying is that Bloom's revised taxonomy was not created for people like you, like a learner. They were created for educators and exam writers. Internationally, almost every single curriculum is designed around Bloom's taxonomy or a similar taxonomy. They're all pretty similar to each other, which means your exam writer is thinking in this way to create the questions that are going to filter out the good versus the great learners. This means you can now predict the types of questions they're going to ask you and even create your own practice papers.

Here's why level four thinkers are not common: As soon as you jump from level three to level four, you will 100% notice that this level of thinking requires more mental effort. It is harder to do. You're thinking for longer and more deeply than the previous levels, which is a good thing because it means that your brain is forming deeper knowledge and stronger memory. But it can feel like you've gotten slower, and some people think that that means they're doing something wrong. Even though most students can think at level four, most students choose not to because it doesn't feel as easy. This is a phenomenon called the "misinterpreted effort hypothesis," and it prevents the majority of learners from ever really improving.

**Level 5: Evaluate**

This is even more the case at level five. Level five thinking is for the top learners. If you can think at level five, you will be reaching those top results. It's also the level that people find the most confusing, so I'm going to make it really simple for you. Level five is all about judgment. At level four, we analyzed, compared, and contrasted. We found similarities and differences. At level five, we're asking, "So what? What does it matter? Who cares? Why is it important?" Level five is called "Evaluate," and learning to think at this level unlocks the level five result, which is "Prioritize."

Let's do that little AI trick again and see the difference in the types of questions we get. You can see level four on the left and level five on the right. Notice that at level five, we are forming conclusions, and now we have to justify them. It's not enough like at level four just to know that there are similarities and differences. We then have to use that knowledge to make a decision. Level five thinking takes much more effort. You'll know that you are doing it right when you are going back and forth between the material, trying to answer the question in your head of "Why does this matter? How does it fit in with everything else? Why do I need to care?" You'll be jumping between your lectures, your textbook, and doing a Google search. These are the signs that you are operating at level five. It's not as easy as the previous levels, but to reach level five results, you need to go through this.

Level four and level five are the types of questions and challenges you'll find in second and third-year university and beyond. In postgrad studies, most of what you're assessed on is level four and level five. Also, pretty much any senior position in any profession will require you to have level four and level five thinking. Much like before, it's less about what your technique looks like and more about what's happening inside your brain. For example, for level five, mind

 maps, teaching, answering questions, and creating summaries are all techniques that are great for level five. But you could also do all of those techniques and still not do it at level five if you're not thinking in the right way.

For example, it's easy to make a mind map just connecting a bunch of lines and arrows together between words, forming a few groups and categories here and there, and just call it done. But that's not level five thinking. It's very different from, for example, creating a mind map where you're critically evaluating which lines and relationships are more important than other possible relationships. You're thinking, "What is the best way I can group these ideas together?" Mentally, it's a very different process, even though physically it can look very similar.

**Level 6: Create**

Level six is about creating a hypothesis. It's about synthesizing new and novel information from what you already know. This level is called "Create," and when you unlock create, it unlocks the level six result, which is "Hypothesize." Some people think that level six create is any situation where you have to generate anything with your knowledge. This is not true. It's only level six if you are creating an answer for something that you don't think the answer exists in your knowledge already. You're identifying a gap and you're creating a potential answer that makes sense based on what you do know.

The reason level six is not as important as the previous levels is that most people will not really be assessed at level six unless you are at the highest levels of education or your profession. Most people in their daily lives will be at the top of their game just being able to perform at level five consistently. But just for your knowledge, here are some examples of level six. As you can see, it's pretty advanced. You can pause to read this a little bit more if you like, or you can jump onto your AI and do this for your own subject.

**Reaching Higher Levels**

Here's the part that is going to blow your mind. If you want to get to level five and level six, there are actually two different methods to get there. The first way is to start studying and just go through each level from bottom to top. First, you remember it, then you understand it, then you apply it, then you analyze it, and so on. This sounds very logical, but for most people, this will not work. The problem with starting at the bottom, mastering level one, then mastering level two, then mastering level three, etc., is that it is very time-consuming. Most people do not have enough time to even reach level five, let alone master it.

In reality, most people will just do a little bit of each level, kind of back and forth. For example, in lectures, they might be doing a little bit of level one and then a little bit of level two. Later, when doing some quizzes, they might be doing a bit of level two and a little bit of level three, just sort of moving back and forth. If they do a more challenging question, they'll be doing a little bit of level four and then level five. This doesn't work very well because we will always forget things over time. In research, we call this phenomenon "knowledge decay." It occurs because memory has something called a forgetting curve. Basically, while you're doing level two and level three, our knowledge of level one will slowly decay away. We're going to forget it. Instead of being able to move up the levels, we're going to be spending most of our time just relearning the things that we continuously forget.

Instead, here is the better way to reach the higher levels. Instead of starting at level one and moving up, start at level five and move down. Remember level five, because level six is not relevant for most people. This works because our brain processes information and forms memory more strongly at level five than it does at level one. When we set our sights at the top, our brain will fill in and achieve the lower levels of results along the way, almost like a side effect. This doesn't work the other way around. If we are trying to just learn so that we can regurgitate material, our brain is not going to then be able to automatically compare or prioritize information. But if we are trying to compare and prioritize, we will gain better memory so that we can, if we need to, regurgitate, explain, and solve problems.

The science on this gets a little bit complicated, so if you want me to go deeper into this, let me know in the comments. Level five takes more mental effort, but it pays off big time by forgetting less. When we start studying, don't focus on trying to remember or understand. Focus most of your attention on trying to evaluate, which forces you to understand and analyze in the first place.
