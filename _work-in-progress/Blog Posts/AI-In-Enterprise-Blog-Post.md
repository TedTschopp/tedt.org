1. Common mistakes
Beginners fall in love with algorithms before understanding the business pain that pays for them. They launch flashy POCs on a walled‑off laptop, only to discover six months later that the data feed they need is owned by another division that will never approve access. They assume “more data” beats “better data,” ignoring lineage, quality, and governance until the first audit writes a finding. They forget change‑management—rolling out a forecasting model without retraining planners who now distrust the system. They treat AI as a project, not a product, so nothing is budgeted for monitoring drift or retraining next quarter.

**Lesson:** If the model can’t plug cleanly into today’s process, its technical accuracy is irrelevant.

2. Unwritten rule
In a Fortune 500, influence flows through the spreadsheet—the KPI that the CFO looks at on Monday. If your model cannot trace a dotted line to that cell, it will eventually be labeled a “science‑fair.” This is why seasoned practitioners spend as much time aligning with Finance as they do tuning hyper‑parameters. Data scientists who ignore this end up demoing dashboards to polite applause while funding shifts elsewhere.

**Lesson:** The real deployment pipeline runs through the corporate P&L, not the CI/CD server.

3. Veteran’s advice
Start with the dumbest baseline that would be acceptable in production and beat it convincingly. Ship that improvement fast, wrap it in service‑level monitoring, then iterate—treat the model like any other product feature. Invest early in MLOps scaffolding (versioned data, reproducible builds, automated rollback) even if your first model is a logistic regression. Forge alliances with Legal, Security, and the business owner; they will save you more cycles than any optimizer.

**Lesson:** Deliver small, measurable wins on top of rock‑solid plumbing—trust and budget will follow.

4. Invisible knowledge

To outsiders AI looks like maths; to insiders it is 80 % sociology and 20 % math.  The hardest bugs live in organizational behavior: incentives, compliance constraints, silent data‑quality sabotage. Experts instinctively ask “Who will be annoyed if this model is right? Who pays if it is wrong?” long before opening a notebook. They design for concept drift not just in data, but in corporate strategy—because a merger can shift thresholds overnight.

**Lesson:** Master the human system around the model or the model will never see daylight.

5. Signs of mastery

True pros talk about prediction intervals and population stability before ROC curves. Their notebooks read like lab journals with rationale, not just code, and their pull requests often delete more than they add. They schedule “sunset reviews” for models the day they launch, signalling comfort with decommissioning as a success metric. In meetings they translate F1‑score into “We’ll catch 3,000 more faulty invoices a month at the cost of 200 false alarms,” grounding stats in frontline impact.

**Lesson:** Expertise shows in disciplined humility—clear assumptions, tidy code, and metrics that business people repeat.

6. Hidden truth
Most AI failures are quiet, slow deaths in year 2–3, when nobody budgets for retraining and the data drift alarm is muted. The total cost of ownership is dominated by post‑launch care—monitoring, feature‑store updates, regulatory re‑certification—not by the initial build. Veterans measure success by how gracefully a model can be turned off without breaking the workflow; resilience beats brilliance.

**Lesson:** Plan for the afterlife of your model on day one—otherwise today’s success becomes tomorrow’s liability.
