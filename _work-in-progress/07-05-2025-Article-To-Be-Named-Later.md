**Bottom Line Up Front**:  *How to adopt a structured framework—Observe, Interpret, Decide, and Act—you can systematically avoid such oversights, blind spots, and confidently implement transformative technologies like AI in your day to day work at SCE. Read on to learn how this simple but powerful cycle can clarify decisions, drive purposeful action, and accelerate transformation in your job.*

Recently, standing quietly at the back of a crowded conference room, I noticed something subtle yet significant. Despite my detailed strategy, I realized afterward I had missed a critical element, leaving everyone hesitant. It reminded me of universal moments of anticipation—like the quiet excitement before a first date, the eager suspense leading up to a birthday party, or the reflective stillness before a significant cultural or religious holiday. There's a deep sense that something important is approaching, even if we're not exactly sure what's missing.

The presentation was engaging yet lacked clarity on essential elements. Specifically, it did not clearly outline required decisions or provide a structured framework for making them. Additionally, it omitted identifying team members responsible for implementing changes and did not highlight metrics needed to measure effectiveness.

This moment captured a powerful truth: true understanding doesn't emerge simply from hearing; it blossoms fully when we intentionally move through a clear cycle—Observe, Interpret, Decide, and Act. As we act, we observe the changes made, and the loop begins again. This idea echoes the enlightenment movement of the 18th century, emphasizing reason, observation, and standardized methods as pathways to knowledge and progress.

Let's explore how this four-stage framework can be practically applied to decision-making, especially in the context of emerging technologies like AI.

First, we **observe**. We collect data from our environment, truly seeing and listening—not just glancing or nodding politely. Observation requires intentionality and humility, recognizing there is always more to understand. For example, we've recently observed a surge in news about AI capabilities, coupled with increased awareness of powerful AI tools available within our company. We notice how these tools are reshaping industries and expectations. This initial observation phase lays the groundwork for deeper understanding.

Next, we **interpret**. We thoughtfully consider our perspective and the perspectives of others. It’s a reflective stage, much like a thoughtful pause, where careful consideration leads us toward deeper understanding. We avoid confirmation bias, acknowledging information beyond our existing beliefs and assumptions. For instance, we might notice how AI tools are reshaping roles similar to ours in other companies and intersecting closely with our core value propositions, highlighting opportunities and strategic alignment.

Then comes the critical moment to **decide**, guided by established frameworks to clearly define our next steps. Equipped with insight from observing and interpreting, we choose our course. Decisions become purposeful commitments to meaningful actions. At a higher level, our decision framework includes:

1. **Continue Current Action** – Maintain existing strategy.
2. **Modify or Adapt** – Adjust based on new insights.
3. **Pause or Delay** – Temporarily hold, gather more information.
4. **Terminate or Reverse** – Completely halt actions due to ineffectiveness or context change.

Under these high-level actions, we consider specific decision types:

1. **Strategic Decisions** – Long-term impacts involving significant changes.
2. **Tactical Decisions** – Addressing spending, resource allocation, and policy adjustments.
3. **Operational Decisions** – Modifying daily activities to enhance efficiency.
4. **Risk Decisions** – Mitigating or managing risks before other decisions.
5. **Compliance Decisions** – Ensuring ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements.

Finally, equipped with clarity from careful observation, thoughtful interpretation, and informed decision-making, we **Act**. Courage is stepping forward despite uncertainty, prepared by thorough groundwork. The larger the change we seek, the greater the courage required. This is the fulfillment stage, where we bring decisions to reality, step boldly into action, and implement changes guided by careful preparation. In making these decisions, we set ourselves up for the next observational step. For example, our recent pilot of an AI-driven chatbot (Copilot) resulted in measurable reductions in busy work, demonstrating the power of structured decision-making.

By consistently moving through this loop, we prepare ourselves to lead workplace transformation. We are not merely informed; we are transformed by renewing our minds with new insights, leading to a workplace that is more natural, purposeful, and impactful.

Applying this structured decision-making framework to AI is particularly relevant given AI's transformative impact across industries. It allows us to strategically align resources, address emerging challenges, and proactively harness opportunities. Now, let's specifically apply this framework to AI adoption across our company:

**Observations**

Nine generative AI use cases are emerging in Fortune 500 companies:

1. **Advanced chatbots for customer service**
2. **Digital assistants for productivity**
3. **Coding assistants for software development**
4. **Marketing support**
5. **Fraud detection**
6. **Cybersecurity**
7. **Business process augmentation**
8. **Predictive analytics / Machine Learning**
9. **Extracting unstructured data from multiple sources**

#### Insights

From our observation of the current landscape, let's investigate these opportunities:

1. **Advanced Chatbot for customer service** - Funded, deployment later this year.
2. **Digital Assistant for productivity** - Copilot Chat deployed for all computer users; CoPilot M365 deployed to 2,500.  700 left.
3. **Coding Assistant for software development** - GitHub Copilot deployed; usage rising. Further expansion paused due to funding.
4. **Marketing Support** - Status unclear; seeking input.
5. **Fraud Detection** - Status unclear; seeking input.
6. **Cybersecurity** - Status unclear; seeking input.
7. **Business Process Augmentation** - Copilot Studio deploying safety agents; fuller deployment in 2026.
8. **Predictive Analytics / Machine Learning** - Extensive activity; seeking broader insights.
9. **Extracting unstructured data** - Successful pilots; seeking clarity on broader support.

#### Decisions

Current AI Focus Areas and Decisions:

1. Advanced Chatbot (Strategic: Modify/Adapt) - Funded, scheduled deployment.
2. Digital Assistant (Strategic: Modify/Adapt) - Deployment ongoing, enhancing employee work.
3. Coding Assistant (Strategic: Modify/Adapt) - Deployed; expansion paused due to funding.
4. Marketing Support (Tactical: Pause/Delay) - Awaiting clarity.
5. Fraud Detection (Risk: Pause/Delay) - Awaiting insights.
6. Cybersecurity (Risk: Pause/Delay) - Awaiting input.
7. Business Process Augmentation (Operational: Modify/Adapt) - Deploying Copilot Studio; strategic deployment in 2026.
8. Predictive Analytics (Strategic: Continue) - Ongoing investment.
9. Extracting Unstructured Data (Tactical: Pause/Delay) - Awaiting clarity.

#### Action

Now, I ask each of you: What AI activities are you involved with? What actions are you taking? Every office worker is impacted by items 2, 7, 8, and 9. Start by reviewing this list and seeing how you can use AI in your life and job. Gain insights by asking coworkers and posting questions here. Then make a decision: Will you continue your current action, modify your approach, pause or delay, or terminate and reverse course? Decide if this will be a strategic, tactical, operational, risk, or compliance-related change.

For example, perhaps you're using AI but unsure about allowed tools. Modify your approach strategically to use approved tools. If you're uncertain to what to do overall, decide to learn more about Digital Assistants or Business Process Augmentation.

Use the chart above as a template to outline your response. Identify concrete steps to implement and monitor these decisions effectively.

Reflecting back in that conference room, I recognized my oversight clearly and saw the chance to correct course. With focused attention, we can move confidently from thoughtful observation to meaningful action. It's a cycle worth repeating. Now, it's your turn—how will you implement AI to enhance your life and work? I invite you to make a clear decision today and act boldly and courageously on it.
