# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template – Power Platform Solutions (Electric Utility)

**Note:** This template is designed for internal IT software products built on Microsoft Power Platform (e.g. Power Apps, Power Automate, DataVerse). It is intended to be used by both IT teams and business-side “citizen developers.” Each section below includes its **Purpose**, **Instructions** on how to fill it out, an **Example**, **Prerequisites** needed before completing the section, and relevant **Standards/Best Practices** to consider. This template follows agile/XP best practices, emphasizing clarity, collaboration, and compliance needs. _Please keep language clear and accessible, as non-IT professionals may be contributors and readers._

## 1\. Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview of the product and its objectives, allowing any reader to quickly grasp what the product is, who it’s for, and why it’s being developed[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=1.%20Executive%20Summary%20,target%20audience%2C%20and%20key%20goals). The executive summary aligns everyone on the vision and sets the stage for the details to follow. It serves as a quick reference for stakeholders to understand the essence of the project.

**Instructions:** Write 1-3 short paragraphs summarizing the product. Include the product’s name, a brief description of its function, the target users or audience, and the core business problem it addresses. Ensure you mention why this product is important to the organization (e.g. what value or benefit it delivers). Keep it concise and free of technical jargon. Imagine this as an “elevator pitch” for the project that anyone – from executives to developers – can understand. Make sure to cover **who** the product is for, **what** it will do, and **why** it’s being built[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=,provide%20value%20to%20your%20customers).

**Example:**  
_Project Falcon is a mobile Power App for field engineers at XYZ Electric Utility. It streamlines the **asset inspection process** by replacing paper forms with a digital solution. **Field technicians** will use the app on tablets to record equipment readings and maintenance notes, even while offline. The data is then automatically uploaded to a central database (Microsoft Dataverse) and routed to supervisors for review. This product addresses the **current delays and errors** in paperwork processing, improving data accuracy and saving an estimated 20% of technicians’ time. By providing real-time visibility into field inspections, Project Falcon enhances regulatory compliance and operational efficiency, aligning with the company’s goal of leveraging digital tools to improve reliability._

**Prerequisites:**

*   A clear definition of the business problem and idea for the solution.
    
*   Identification of the target user group and their needs.
    
*   Management buy-in or a project mandate outlining high-level goals.
    
*   Any prior research or feasibility studies to ensure the project’s viability (if available).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Ensure the summary is **brief and comprehensive**. Many PRD frameworks recommend an executive summary or introduction that covers the product’s purpose, key benefits, and alignment with business goals[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=1)[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=1.%20Executive%20Summary%20,target%20audience%2C%20and%20key%20goals). Avoid technical details here – focus on **what** and **why**, not **how**. This section should be understandable to all stakeholders, including business executives, auditors, or new team members. Following the SMART guideline for objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) can help keep the content focused[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=PRD%20to%20ensure%20comprehensive%20coverage,the%20PRD%20as%20the%20project). Finally, remember that even in agile environments, having this high-level overview is valuable for getting all stakeholders aligned on the product vision[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=While%20lengthy%2C%20highly%20detailed%20product,a%20comprehensive%20PRD%20is%20essential).

## 2\. Background & Problem Statement

**Purpose:** Describe the business context and the problem that this product will solve. This section provides background information on why the project is needed, helping readers understand the current pain points or opportunities. It sets the “why now” and the urgency or importance of the initiative.

**Instructions:** Explain the current situation or process in the business that led to the need for this product. Identify pain points, inefficiencies, regulatory drivers, or business opportunities. Be factual and specific: include any data or anecdotes that illustrate the problem (e.g. “X process takes N days” or “error rate is Y%”). If this product replaces or improves an existing system, mention what is in place today and its shortcomings. Ensure the **problem** is clearly stated – a reader should be able to say, “I understand what issue we’re trying to fix.” This section can also reference any strategic initiative or mandate (for example, a digital transformation goal or a regulatory requirement) that makes the project a priority. Keep the tone straightforward so that even non-technical stakeholders grasp the significance.

**Example:**  
_Currently, field inspection data at XYZ Electric is collected via paper forms. This manual process is **error-prone and slow** – completed forms are physically transported to the office and re-entered into spreadsheets, causing an average **5-day delay** in updating records. Errors in data entry have led to **compliance issues**, as seen in last year’s audit where 15% of records had discrepancies. Additionally, there is **no easy way to track** if an asset was inspected without calling the office, leading to miscommunication and occasional missed inspections. This project was initiated after a review by the Operations Excellence team highlighted that digitizing this process could significantly improve data accuracy and timeliness._

**Prerequisites:**

*   Gather information on the current process or system (through interviews, observations, or reports).
    
*   Identify any quantitative metrics that illustrate the problem (e.g. error rates, time delays, costs).
    
*   Ensure clarity on the scope of the problem (which departments or business units are affected, how widespread or severe it is).
    
*   If applicable, confirm any external factors pushing this project (such as audit findings, new regulations, or strategic goals set by leadership).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Clearly articulating the problem statement is a best practice in requirements documentation – it aligns the team on **why** the project matters. Many product documents and standards (like IEEE recommendations) emphasize describing the current context and issues as part of the introduction[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=2)[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=2). Make sure the problem is stated in business terms (avoid assuming a solution at this stage). This section should resonate with readers from the business side and justify the need for investment. In agile terms, understanding the problem is key to ensuring we build the right solution, and it provides context for user stories and requirements that follow.

## 3\. Goals & Business Objectives (Success Metrics)

**Purpose:** Define what the product aims to achieve in business terms and how success will be measured. This section translates the problem into concrete goals, linking the product to strategic business objectives and outcomes[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=2.%20Business%20Objectives%20,User%20Personas). It ensures everyone knows the target results and can later verify if the product delivered the expected value.

**Instructions:** List the specific goals or objectives of this product. Objectives should address the problem stated above and provide a vision of **what success looks like**. Where possible, quantify the goals (e.g. “reduce processing time by 50%” or “increase user satisfaction to 90% positive feedback”). Include any key performance indicators (KPIs) or success metrics that the business will track. If there are non-quantifiable goals (like improving user experience or compliance), describe how you will know if those goals are met (for example, “zero audit findings related to this process in the next SOX audit”). Ensure objectives are **SMART** – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=PRD%20to%20ensure%20comprehensive%20coverage,the%20PRD%20as%20the%20project). Also mention alignment with higher-level business strategies or mandates if relevant (e.g. “This supports the corporate initiative to digitalize field operations”). Keep the list focused (3-5 primary objectives is typical) and prioritize clarity over technical detail.

**Example:**

*   _Reduce the average time to update inspection records from 5 days to **1 day** by automating data capture and transmission._
    
*   \*Eliminate manual data entry errors, achieving **99% data accuracy** in recorded inspection information (measured by comparing field input vs. database records). \*
    
*   _Improve compliance with maintenance schedules: ensure **100% of required inspections** are logged and tracked, supporting regulatory reporting with no missed entries._
    
*   _Enhance user satisfaction for field engineers and supervisors, aiming for a **\>90% positive feedback** rating in post-implementation surveys._
    
*   _Align with XYZ Electric’s digital transformation goal: this project will contribute to the target of a **20% efficiency improvement** in field operations this fiscal year._
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Agreement on business priorities (e.g. through discussions with the project sponsor or Business Process Owner).
    
*   Baseline measurements for current performance (so improvements can be quantified – e.g., current error rate, current process time).
    
*   Access to any strategic documents or corporate goals to ensure alignment.
    
*   Input from stakeholders on what success would look like (for example, feedback from end-users, or audit requirements for compliance).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Goals should directly address the problem and be **measurable**. Industry best practices suggest that well-defined success metrics keep the team focused and provide a basis for acceptance[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=2.%20Business%20Objectives%20,User%20Personas). Make sure each goal is _realistic_ and tied to a business outcome, not a technical output. According to agile/product guidance, goals (or “release criteria”) should be easy to understand and clearly actionable and measurable[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=Your%20goals%20should%20be%3A). It’s also wise to review goals with stakeholders to ensure they agree these reflect a successful outcome. In regulated environments (like utilities), linking to compliance and risk reduction is a best practice, and objectives may include meeting specific audit or regulatory criteria.

## 4\. Scope of Work (In-Scope & Out-of-Scope)

**Purpose:** Clearly delineate what features and deliverables are **in scope** for this product (especially for the initial release or project phase) and what is **out of scope**. This prevents scope creep and sets correct expectations by outlining the boundaries of the product[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=3.%20Product%20Scope%20,behaviors%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20pain%20points). It helps all parties understand what will be delivered and equally what will **not** be part of this effort.

**Instructions:** List the major features, functionalities, or components that will be included in the product. This can be a bullet list grouped by categories if needed. For each in-scope item, provide a brief description if not obvious. Then, provide an **Out-of-Scope** list of items that people might expect but which will **not** be addressed in this project (perhaps deferred to future phases or explicitly excluded). For example, if the product is an internal app, out-of-scope might be “customer-facing portal” or integration with a system that you won’t tackle now. Be specific enough to remove ambiguity. If using agile MoSCoW prioritization, you might label items as “Must have”, “Should have”, etc., but at minimum separate the included vs. excluded items. Keep in mind the resources and timeline – scope should be realistic for the project’s constraints. Also, ensure any regulatory or critical feature is not mistakenly left out if it’s needed (tie back to objectives: if an objective needs a feature, it should be in scope).

**Example (In-Scope):**

*   _Development of a **Canvas Power App** with screens for asset selection, inspection data entry (including photo upload and GPS capture), and submission._
    
*   _A **Power Automate workflow** to route submitted inspection reports for supervisory approval and log approvals in the audit log._
    
*   _Integration with the **Dataverse** (or SharePoint list) to store inspection records centrally, with appropriate data schema for assets, inspections, and approvals._
    
*   _Basic **analytics dashboard** in Power BI for supervisors to view inspection status (e.g., completed vs. pending inspections), using the collected data._
    
*   _User access control setup: only authenticated field engineers can submit data; supervisors can review/approve; admins can view all records._
    

**Example (Out-of-Scope):**

*   _Integration with the legacy Asset Management System’s maintenance scheduling (this will be handled in a later phase; in this phase, asset data will be imported manually or via a simple data sync)._
    
*   _Any direct customer-facing functionality (this app is for internal field use only, not for customers)._
    
*   _Offline mapping or GIS integration beyond basic GPS capture (not included due to time constraints)._
    
*   _Support for non-standard devices or operating systems (the app will be designed for company-issued Windows tablets only, not personal mobile phones)._
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   A brainstorming or requirements workshop to list all desired features.
    
*   Prioritization of features (perhaps with stakeholder input) to decide what must be in the initial release versus what can wait.
    
*   Understanding of any constraints (time, budget, technology) that limit scope.
    
*   Agreement from project sponsors or owners on what the focus is (and isn’t) for this release.
    
*   If this is an ongoing product, clarity on release phasing (what is targeted now vs. later).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Defining scope is critical in any requirements standard. For example, the **Product Scope** section in many templates outlines boundaries and included features[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=3.%20Product%20Scope%20,behaviors%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20pain%20points). Clearly stating out-of-scope items is equally important to prevent misunderstandings. Best practices suggest using visual aids (like a scope diagram or context diagram) if needed, but a well-structured list suffices. In agile contexts, scope can evolve, but it’s still useful to have an initial scope definition for planning. If using MoSCoW or similar prioritization, document those priorities. Ensure traceability: each in-scope item should relate to an objective or user need, and each objective should be covered by scope. By following scope definition guidelines (such as those in IEEE 830 SRS standard, which emphasizes stating product scope and exclusions), you improve stakeholder alignment and make later change management easier[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=2)[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=3.%20Product%20Scope%20,behaviors%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20pain%20points).

## 5\. Stakeholders & User Personas

**Purpose:** Identify **who** will use or be affected by the product, and who is involved in its success. This section lists key stakeholders (including end users, project sponsors, Business Process Owners, etc.) and provides profiles of primary user personas. It ensures the product is designed with the right audience in mind and clarifies roles and responsibilities (e.g. who will approve changes, who will support the system). A user-centric approach keeps development aligned with user needs[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=1,product%20aligned%20with%20user%20expectations)[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,behaviors%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20pain%20points).

**Instructions:** Define the different groups of people related to this product:

*   **User Personas:** For each main type of end user, provide a short persona description. Include their role, typical background or skill level (especially with tech), goals, and pain points relevant to this product. Keep personas realistic (you can base them on actual employees if known). For example, “Field Technician Alice: 5 years experience, needs to quickly log inspections with minimal typing; not very tech-savvy, values simplicity and offline capability.” List 2-5 personas depending on how many user types the product has.
    
*   **Stakeholders:** List other stakeholders such as the Business Process Owner (the person responsible for the business process this app supports), project sponsor, IT owner, compliance officer, etc. For each, indicate their interest or role (e.g. “Finance Manager (Business Process Owner) – will sign off that the solution meets SOX control requirements,” or “IT Security Analyst – will review the app for security compliance”). Also include who will develop and maintain the product if relevant (e.g. a citizen developer or IT developer, support team). If needed, note any external parties (perhaps auditors or regulators who will review outputs, though they are not users of the app itself).  
    Make sure to capture how each persona or stakeholder interacts with or benefits from the product. This will guide requirements to satisfy each group’s needs.
    

**Example:**

*   **End User – Field Technician:** _Frontline employee in the maintenance department. Typically operates in substations or field sites using a tablet. Needs a quick, straightforward way to input inspection results. Pain points: limited time at each site, often works with gloves (accuracy of input is a concern), sometimes has no internet connectivity. Goal: finish data entry during the inspection itself and reduce paperwork._
    
*   **End User – Maintenance Supervisor:** _Office-based supervisor overseeing 10-15 field techs. Uses a desktop PC. Needs to review incoming inspection reports, ensure they are complete, and sign off work daily. Pain point: current process requires chasing paperwork and manually updating a tracking spreadsheet. Goal: get real-time visibility of field work and easily ensure all inspections are completed and approved._
    
*   **Business Process Owner – Maintenance Manager (Jane Doe):** _Responsible for the overall asset inspection process. Ensures the process meets internal controls and regulatory compliance (e.g., SOX controls if inspection data impacts financials). Will need to **approve the new process and system** and sign off that it meets required controls. Interest: that the app improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy or compliance._
    
*   **Project Sponsor – Operations Director:** _Champion of the project providing budget and support. Interested in high-level outcomes like efficiency gains and compliance improvements. Will receive periodic updates and will approve major scope or priority changes._
    
*   **IT Security Analyst:** _Responsible for reviewing the app for security vulnerabilities and data protection compliance. Ensures the solution meets corporate IT security policies (like proper authentication, data encryption, etc.). Will need documentation of the app’s security measures._
    
*   **Development & Support Team:** _A small team including a Power Platform Developer (could be an IT developer or a trained business user), and an IT Support Lead who will maintain the app after launch. They need to understand the requirements, design accordingly, and be prepared to support the user base (e.g., handle issues, enhancements). Future maintenance staff will refer to this PRD to understand the app’s purpose and design decisions._
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Identify all user groups through interviews or process maps (make sure to involve actual end users and get their input).
    
*   Identify the Business Process Owner and ensure they are engaged (especially since sign-offs are required).
    
*   Clarify who the project sponsor is and other governance roles (e.g. who must approve changes, who oversees compliance).
    
*   Confirm any external stakeholders (like auditors or regulatory bodies) who won’t use the system but will use outputs or need it to meet certain criteria.
    
*   Collect any relevant characteristics about users (technical skill level, environment they work in, any special needs like accessibility).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Writing down user personas is a widely recommended practice to keep the product user-centered[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,behaviors%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20pain%20points). Each persona should highlight user needs and pain points, which drive functional requirements. For stakeholders, it aligns with the RACI approach (knowing who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed). Ensure that you consider **user experience** differences – for example, a standard that might apply is to design for the “least technical” user in your persona set, to maximize usability. Including stakeholders like BPO and auditors is particularly important in a regulated industry; industry frameworks like **COSO** suggest strong business ownership of controls, which is why we list the Business Process Owner and their role in sign-off[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=Though%20they%20may%20not%20be,best%20practices%20to%20their%20organizations). Overall, involving all relevant stakeholders in defining requirements is a best practice[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=1,product%20aligned%20with%20user%20expectations) – this section essentially documents who those people are.

## 6\. Functional Requirements & Features

**Purpose:** Detail the features and functionality the product must have. This is the core of the PRD, specifying what the system should do to satisfy user needs and business objectives[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=5.%20Functional%20Requirements%20,performance%2C%20security%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20usability). In agile terms, this often takes the form of user stories describing desired capabilities from the user’s perspective[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,more%20about%20user%20stories%20here). This section ensures the development team knows exactly what to build and the stakeholders know what to expect in terms of behavior.

**Instructions:** List the functional requirements, grouping them logically (by feature, user persona, or process step). Each requirement can be written as:

*   **User Stories:** This is highly recommended for agile/XP teams. Use the format “As a **\[user role\]**, I want **\[some capability\]** so that **\[benefit\]**.”[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,more%20about%20user%20stories%20here) Follow each user story with acceptance criteria (bullet points that describe how to verify the story is implemented correctly). Acceptance criteria define the conditions of satisfaction for that requirement (for example, “Given X when Y happens, then Z should result”).
    
*   **Use Case or Functional Description:** If not using user stories, you can describe the feature in terms of system behavior (e.g. “The system shall …”). However, keep descriptions clear and testable. If using traditional “shall” statements, ensure each is unambiguous and verifiable.  
    You can mix user story format and more detailed descriptions as needed – for instance, present high-level user stories, then detail specific sub-requirements or business rules under each. If the solution has multiple components (app and workflow, etc.), ensure to cover requirements for each piece. Also incorporate any **business rules** (specific logic that must be followed) here. For example, “If an inspection fails, the system must automatically flag it for review and prevent closure until an approval is given.”  
    Be sure to cover all functionalities needed by the personas identified. Number or label requirements for traceability. Prioritize them if helpful (must-have vs nice-to-have), though if something is out-of-scope it should not be here at all – this is strictly the included functionality.
    

**Example (User Story format):**

*   _As a **Field Technician**, I want to **capture asset inspection data (readings, notes, photos) in the app** so that **I don’t have to carry paper forms and can input data in one go**.[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,more%20about%20user%20stories%20here)_
    
    *   _Acceptance Criteria:_
        
        *   _Technician can select an asset from a list or by scanning a barcode/QR code._
            
        *   _The app provides input fields for all required data points (numeric readings, text notes, photo attachments, etc.)._
            
        *   _If the device is offline, the app stores the data locally and informs the user; it syncs automatically when back online._
            
        *   _All required fields must be filled before submission (the app should validate and prompt if something is missing)._
            
*   _As a **Maintenance Supervisor**, I want to **receive a notification when a new inspection report is submitted** so that **I can review and approve it promptly**._
    
    *   _Acceptance Criteria:_
        
        *   _Upon submission by a tech, a Power Automate flow triggers an email (or Teams notification) to the supervisor of that technician._
            
        *   _Notification includes key info (who submitted, which asset, any critical issues flagged). The supervisor can click a link to open the report in the app._
            
        *   _The supervisor can approve or reject the inspection report within the app. Approving marks the record as “approved” and logs the time and approver’s name. Rejecting requires a comment and sends the report back to the technician for correction._
            
*   _As the **System**, I want to **automatically log all submissions and approvals** so that **there is an audit trail of who did what and when**._
    
    *   _Acceptance Criteria:_
        
        *   _Every inspection form submission is recorded with a timestamp, the technician’s ID, and a unique record ID._
            
        *   _Every approval or rejection by a supervisor is recorded with timestamp, approver ID, and any comments._
            
        *   _Audit log records are read-only and can be exported for audit purposes._
            

_(Additional functional requirements would be listed similarly for other capabilities, such as viewing past inspection history, editing records (if allowed), generating summary reports, etc.)_

**Prerequisites:**

*   Requirements elicitation should be done before filling this out: e.g., workshops or interviews with end users and process owners to gather all needed functionality.
    
*   A good understanding of the business process flow (some teams create flowcharts or use case diagrams first) to ensure no step is missed.
    
*   Agreement on any major design decisions that affect functionality (for example, if it’s decided that offline use is required, that drives specific requirements like local data storage).
    
*   Prioritization if necessary – identify which features are critical for MVP (Minimum Viable Product) if this is iterative delivery.
    
*   Ensure compliance and security input is considered early: e.g., if certain approvals or data checks are needed, those should appear as requirements. (Collaboration with a business analyst or product owner is ideal here.)
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Each requirement should be **clear, unambiguous, and testable**. A common standard is to follow the INVEST criteria for user stories: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,more%20about%20user%20stories%20here). The example user story format (“As a … I want … so that …”) is industry-standard for agile teams[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=,more%20about%20user%20stories%20here), encouraging focus on user value. It’s also recommended to include acceptance criteria – this aligns with Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and ensures we know how to verify a requirement is met. For functional requirements, referencing **IEEE 830** (now ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148) guidance, each requirement should be numbered and phrased as “the system shall…” if using traditional format, and must be verifiable[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=2). In regulated industries, ensure traceability: each functional requirement should tie back to a business objective or compliance need. Lastly, maintain simplicity in language (business people are writing/reading this), avoiding overly technical jargon. Collaboration in writing these (e.g., with developers or testers) can help ensure feasibility and clarity[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=1,product%20aligned%20with%20user%20expectations).

## 7\. Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)

**Purpose:** Specify requirements that describe _how_ the system should perform or other attributes that aren’t specific features. These include performance, security, usability, scalability, availability, and other quality attributes[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=6.%20Non,performance%2C%20security%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20usability). Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are crucial for user satisfaction and for meeting corporate IT policies, especially in an enterprise and regulated environment. They ensure that beyond delivering features, the product meets certain standards and constraints.

**Instructions:** List and describe the non-functional requirements for the product. Common categories to consider:

*   **Performance:** How fast or responsive should the app be? e.g., “Screens should load within 3 seconds with a typical cellular connection” or “The system should support 50 concurrent users without noticeable lag.” Include any throughput needs (e.g., if processing data in batch, how many records per minute).
    
*   **Usability & Accessibility:** Requirements for the user experience, especially important since users might be non-technical. e.g., “The app must be usable on a tablet in outdoor conditions (bright sunlight, etc.),” or “Follow corporate UX guidelines and color schemes,” or “Comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) to accommodate color-blind or other users.”
    
*   **Reliability & Availability:** e.g., “The system should be available 99.9% during business hours,” or “It should gracefully handle network drops by queuing data for later sync,” etc. If the app is critical, define acceptable downtime or failover requirements.
    
*   **Scalability:** e.g., “Capable of scaling to additional departments or doubling the user count within 1 year without major rework.” For Power Platform, maybe, “If data grows to 100k records, performance should remain acceptable.”
    
*   **Security:** (If not covered in the next section, you can mention here as well.) e.g., “All data at rest must be encrypted (since it’s on Dataverse, ensure encryption features are used),” and “Data in transit must use HTTPS,” etc. Also, “The app must enforce role-based access – only authorized roles can access certain features or data.”
    
*   **Maintainability & Supportability:** e.g., “The solution should be built using approved Power Platform components to ease maintenance,” or “It should include admin functions for configuration so that small changes (like updating a list of values) don’t require a code change.”
    
*   **Other Constraints:** Any device constraints (only Windows 10+ devices, specific browser if it’s model-driven app, etc.), or integration constraints (like it must use only standard connectors due to licensing). Possibly regulatory constraints here too, but those might go in compliance section.  
    Write each NFR as a statement. If possible, attach a metric or standard (for example, if the company has an internal SLA or a coding standard). Make sure these are realistic given the platform (e.g., Power Apps have some known limits – incorporate those if relevant). In some cases, you might prioritize NFRs as well if not all can be met fully.
    

**Example:**

*   _Performance:_ The app must load the main form in **< 3 seconds** on a standard corporate tablet with 4G connectivity. Submissions of an inspection form (data save and trigger of workflow) should complete in **< 5 seconds** on average.
    
*   _Offline Capability:_ The app **must support offline use** – technicians can enter data with no internet. Any offline data is stored locally and automatically synced when connectivity is restored, with no data loss (this is critical for remote site work).
    
*   _Security:_ All users must authenticate via **Azure Active Directory** with their corporate credentials. The app will use the built-in Power Platform security model to ensure data is only accessible by authorized roles (technicians can only see their own entries, supervisors see their team’s, etc.). **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** is required as per corporate IT policy for accessing any cloud app. Data at rest in Dataverse is encrypted by Microsoft’s cloud encryption; sensitive fields (if any) should use field-level security.
    
*   _Usability:_ The user interface should follow our internal UX guidelines for Power Apps (consistent branding, fonts, and navigation). It should be optimized for tablet screen (~10 inch) with large touch targets (buttons, input fields sized for touch). Error messages must be **clear and actionable** (no technical jargon).
    
*   _Accessibility:_ Use high-contrast colors and support screen reader navigation for any text fields, as per **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines (ensuring the solution can be used by employees with disabilities).
    
*   _Availability & Backup:_ The system should have an **uptime of 99.5%** during 6am-6pm working hours. In case of Dataverse outages or major issues, a contingency plan (e.g., manual fallback to paper) should be documented. Data should be backed up as per IT policy (Dataverse nightly backups suffice, per enterprise standard).
    
*   _Scalability:_ The design (data schema and app) should support expansion to other regions of the company – up to **200 users** – without significant rework. It should also handle up to **100,000 inspection records** in the database over time without performance degradation (leveraging indexing and efficient queries).
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Corporate non-functional requirements or guidelines (many companies have standard NFRs or security requirements – gather those from enterprise architecture or IT security teams).
    
*   Performance testing results or expectations (if there are existing similar apps, their performance can inform targets).
    
*   Input from IT infrastructure team regarding availability targets and backup/DR (disaster recovery) needs.
    
*   Understanding of user environment (for usability: e.g., field conditions, device capabilities; for accessibility: check if any known requirements from HR or legal).
    
*   Knowledge of Power Platform limits and best practices (e.g., how offline is handled, data storage limits) to set feasible NFRs. Possibly involve a Power Platform architect to validate these.
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Non-functional requirements are often guided by industry standards and internal policies. For instance, performance and reliability might refer to ITIL service level agreements, and security might follow **ISO 27001** or NIST guidelines for access control. It’s recommended to categorize NFRs (as done above) for clarity[slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/prd-template-for-product-managers/124483681#:~:text=prototype%20screenshots%20and%20UI%20wireframes,net). Many agile teams incorporate NFRs into their Definition of Done or acceptance criteria for stories. For example, an NFR that the system must be WCAG 2.1 compliant is essentially a quality standard every relevant feature should meet. Using the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model can help ensure you cover all quality attributes (functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability). In this document, ensure each NFR is testable or verifiable. For example, instead of “fast performance,” specify an exact metric. Also, align with any **corporate standards** – e.g., “all apps must use SSO” or “all data classified as Confidential must be encrypted.” By explicitly documenting these, you help Cybersecurity Risk Analysts and auditors review the solution against required benchmarks[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=At%20Microsoft%2C%20we%20share%20the,part%20of%20your%20SOX%20compliance). In short, treat NFRs as equally important as functional requirements; they often have dedicated sections in standards like IEEE because they critically affect user acceptance and compliance[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=6.%20Non,performance%2C%20security%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20usability).

## 8\. Solution Architecture & Design Overview

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview of how the solution will be built and organized. This section describes the **system architecture** in simple terms – the major components, their interactions, and key design decisions. It bridges the gap between requirements and the actual implementation approach, helping both developers and non-technical stakeholders understand the solution’s structure. It’s especially useful for future developers, IT staff, or auditors to quickly see how data flows and where key functions reside.

**Instructions:** Describe the architecture using text and optionally diagrams. Focus on the components relevant to Power Platform solutions:

*   **Architecture Diagram:** _(Optional but encouraged)_ If possible, include or reference a simple diagram (could be attached separately) that shows components like the Power App, Power Automate flows, Dataverse or other data sources, and any external systems or APIs. Even a basic block diagram with arrows for data flow will help. (If embedding an image, ensure it’s clear and labeled.)
    
*   **Application Type:** Specify if it’s a Canvas App or Model-Driven App (or a combination), or even a Power BI report, etc. Explain why that type was chosen if relevant (e.g. “Canvas app for full UI control and offline support”).
    
*   **Key Components:** List the main components: e.g., “Canvas App (Project Falcon App) – for field data entry and supervisor approval interface”, “Power Automate Flow (Inspection Approval Flow) – to send notifications and log approvals”, “Dataverse – storing asset and inspection data”, “Azure API or Connector – if integrating with an external system (describe which one and why)”. Include any Microsoft 365 or Azure services if used (maybe SharePoint, if not using Dataverse, or Azure Functions, etc.).
    
*   **Data Model:** Provide a brief overview of the data entities/tables involved and relationships. For example, “We will have a Dataverse table for Assets, one for Inspection Reports, and one for Approval Logs. Each Inspection is linked to an Asset, and each Approval links to an Inspection.” If using existing data sources, mention them (e.g., “Asset data will be pulled from the enterprise Asset Management system via a scheduled integration”).
    
*   **Integration Points:** Describe how the app integrates with other systems or data sources. For instance, “The app uses a standard SQL connector to read equipment details from the maintenance database” or “We utilize the Office 365 Outlook connector in Power Automate to send emails.” If any custom connectors or APIs are used, mention them and their purpose.
    
*   **Solution Environment & Deployment:** Note which environment the solution will reside in (Dev/Test/Prod Power Platform environments) and how it will be moved between them (if known, e.g., using solution export/import, managed solutions). This is especially relevant to auditors/IT to know how changes are promoted.
    
*   **Key Design Decisions/Patterns:** Mention any important decisions like “Offline mode will be handled using the Power Apps LoadData/SaveData functions” or “We chose Dataverse over SharePoint list for data storage due to relational data needs and security.” Also, if any known limitations and their workarounds exist, include those (e.g., “We anticipate large data volume, so will implement data archiving by year to maintain performance”).  
    Keep this section high-level – it’s not a detailed technical spec, but enough that someone could draw a mental picture of the system. Use non-technical language as much as possible (avoid deep code-level talk) so that business readers and auditors can follow.
    

**Example:**  
_The solution consists of a **Canvas Power App** (working title “FieldInspect App”) which will run on tablet devices for field techs and on desktop for supervisors. The app has multiple screens: Login/Home, Asset Selection (with search or scan), Inspection Form, and Supervisor Review._

_Data will be stored in **Microsoft Dataverse** within our “FieldApps” environment. We have three main tables: **Assets**, **Inspections**, and **Approvals**. Assets (pre-loaded with asset ID, name, location info) relate one-to-many with Inspections (each Inspection record captures form data plus a lookup to the Asset and the Technician user). Approvals table records supervisor approvals/rejections, linked to Inspections._

_A **Power Automate** cloud flow called “InspectionApprovalFlow” is triggered when a new Inspection record is created or updated. This flow sends an **email notification** to the respective supervisor (looked up from a supervisor field in the asset or tech’s profile) and posts a message in the Team’s channel for visibility. The flow also updates the Approval table once the supervisor responds in the app._

_The app uses built-in **Offline functionality**: when launched with internet, it caches the list of Assets locally. Technicians can use the app offline; it uses **SaveData/LoadData** to store drafts. When back online, the technician can submit, and the app will write to Dataverse (which triggers the flow). To handle this, a local flag and a sync button exist in the UI._

_Integration: The solution will integrate with our **Asset Management System** (Maximo) by a daily data export of Assets into Dataverse (using a scheduled Azure Data Factory pipeline, managed by IT). No real-time integration is used to keep the app simple and mostly offline-capable. For email, the Power Automate uses the standard Office 365 Outlook connector (no external email system)._

_Security Design: The app relies on Dataverse security roles. We will have a “Technician” security role (can Create Inspections, read only their own records), a “Supervisor” role (can read all Inspections for their team’s assets and approve them), and an “Admin” role (full access for IT support). Azure AD groups will map to these roles. This ensures data segregation by role._

_Environment & Deployment: The development is done in the “FieldApps Dev” Power Platform environment. Once tested, we will package the solution (Canvas app, tables, flows) into a managed solution and deploy to “FieldApps Prod” environment. Auditors can get a solution export if needed to review configurations. All configuration (e.g., list of supervisors, email templates) will be stored in a config entity so that changes do not require app re-publish._

_Key Design Considerations: We chose a Canvas App for flexibility in UI (needed to accommodate photos and custom layout for offline use). Dataverse was selected over SharePoint for robust offline sync and relational data support, and because it offers better security control for sensitive data. We are aware of the 2MB limit on offline data per table in Power Apps – our asset list is ~500 records, which is fine. We also took into account future expansion: by using Dataverse and a modular flow, adding another department’s inspections in the future would be straightforward._

_(Refer to Diagram 1 for an architecture overview – showing the app, Dataverse, Power Automate flow, and integration with external systems.)_

**Prerequisites:**

*   Initial solution planning with an architect or senior developer to decide on the platform components and feasibility (e.g., confirming that Power Apps can meet offline requirements).
    
*   Diagrams or lists of existing systems that need to interface with this product (for identifying integration points).
    
*   Enterprise architecture standards (there may be guidelines which need to be followed, like “prefer Dataverse over SharePoint for data X” or approved connectors list).
    
*   Knowledge of the licensing implications (e.g., using Dataverse and offline might require certain Power Apps licenses; ensure that’s accounted for in design decisions).
    
*   Environment setup availability – ensure you know where this will be deployed (Dev/Test/Prod) and any constraints on those environments (some companies have a Center of Excellence with rules for Power Platform environments).
    
*   Input from IT security or infrastructure teams on any design constraints (for instance, if there are policies about data residency, or if certain cloud connectors are disallowed in the utility company’s IT policy).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** While this is not a full technical specification, it’s aligned with the idea of providing a **Technical Specifications/Architecture** outline as seen in formal templates[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=8.%20Technical%20Specifications%20,integration%20points%2C%20and%20technical%20constraints). Best practices include using standardized diagramming (like UML deployment diagrams or C4 Model Level 1 context diagrams) to visualize the architecture. For Power Platform, Microsoft’s Power Platform Architecture Framework can be a guide – ensure the solution respects the governance (e.g., using Data Loss Prevention policies- which connectors are allowed). In an Agile environment, high-level design is often discussed but not always documented; however, given this document may be read by auditors and future support, including this overview is valuable. Industry standards like **C4 model** encourage a context and container view – you might include a context diagram showing users and systems, and a container diagram showing the app/flow/data components. Also, referencing any patterns or frameworks (like OWASP for security design, or **COSO/COBIT** if some controls are implemented as part of design) would assure reviewers that best practices are followed[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=will%20have%20in%20common%20with,and%20even%20corporate%20governance%20controls)[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=SOX%20IT%20Controls%20and%20Cybersecurity). In summary, this section should give a technically literate reader an idea of how everything fits together, while still being digestible by a non-technical stakeholder.

## 9\. Security, Compliance & Controls (SOX Requirements)

**Purpose:** Document the security measures, compliance requirements, and internal controls that the product must adhere to – especially those related to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) if the application impacts financial reporting or critical business processes. This section ensures that from the design stage, the solution includes necessary **controls** (both IT controls and business process controls) to meet corporate and regulatory standards[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=SOX%20IT%20Controls%20and%20Cybersecurity). It also captures the plan for getting required sign-offs (e.g., Business Process Owner approval) for compliance. Auditors and risk analysts will refer to this section to understand how the solution manages risk and compliance.

**Instructions:** Describe all relevant security and compliance requirements. Break it down into sub-areas for clarity:

*   **Data Classification & Privacy:** State the classification of the data handled (e.g., Confidential, Internal, Public). For an electric utility, inspection data might be Internal, but if it ties to financial assets or customer info, it could be Confidential. Note if any personal data is involved (likely not, but if so, mention privacy measures like GDPR compliance or anonymization).
    
*   **Access Controls:** Explain how access to the app and data is restricted. This overlaps with what was mentioned in architecture, but reiterate from a control perspective. E.g., “Only employees in Maintenance department can access the app; access is granted via Azure AD security groups mapped to roles. No external access is allowed. Role-based security ensures segregation of duties (technicians cannot approve their own work, only supervisors can).” Mention if principles like **Least Privilege** are implemented, and how (perhaps via those security roles).
    
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** State that corporate Single Sign-On (SSO) is used (Azure AD). If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for all cloud app access (common policy), note that. Confirm that no shared accounts are used – each action is tied to an individual user identity for accountability (this is important for SOX audit trails).
    
*   **Audit Logging:** Describe what audit logs or trails are in place. For SOX, having an audit trail of changes is critical[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=administered%20by%20the%20Securities%20and,changes%20related%20to%20financial%20reporting). E.g., “The system automatically logs all create/update/delete actions on inspection records, including timestamp and user ID, in an immutable audit log (provided by Dataverse out-of-the-box audit functionality, which is enabled). These logs will be retained for at least 7 years in line with financial record retention policies.” If Power Platform’s native audit is used, mention enabling it. Also mention logging of sign-offs/approvals as part of the business control (as in the functional requirements example).
    
*   **SOX Controls Implemented:** Be explicit about which internal controls relevant to SOX are supported by the system. For instance:
    
    *   _Approval Control:_ “Every inspection affecting a regulated asset must be approved by a supervisor before it’s considered final. This ensures a second-level review, addressing segregation-of-duties – the person performing work isn’t the one approving it[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=will%20have%20in%20common%20with,and%20even%20corporate%20governance%20controls).”
        
    *   _Completeness Control:_ “The system ensures all required inspection data is entered (cannot submit if missing info), reducing risk of incomplete records[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=internal%20control%20structures%20in%20place,changes%20related%20to%20financial%20reporting).”
        
    *   _Accuracy Control:_ “Real-time validation (range checks on readings, etc.) to catch obvious errors at entry. Also, data is pulled from authoritative source (asset list) to avoid typos.”
        
    *   _Access Control:_ “Only authorized personnel can create or approve records, preventing unauthorized changes[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=will%20have%20in%20common%20with,and%20even%20corporate%20governance%20controls). Also, technicians cannot edit records after submission – to preserve data integrity (any changes post-submission require supervisor’s action).”
        
    *   _Change Management Control:_ If the application is considered a SOX application, note how changes to it will be controlled. E.g., “All changes to this application will go through IT change management. There is an approval process for changes, and an audit trail of modifications to the app configuration (Power Platform maintains version history of solutions).”
        
*   **Other Compliance:** Mention if there are other regulatory or policy requirements: for example, NERC CIP (for critical infrastructure) might require certain cyber security practices if this system touches operational grid data – likely not in this context if it’s maintenance, but worth noting if any. Or any OSHA safety data considerations, etc. Also mention if any **SOX 404** documentation will be produced (like a controls testing document or if this system will be included in SOX scope review annually).
    
*   **Business Process Owner Sign-off:** Clearly state the plan for sign-off. E.g., “Before go-live, the Business Process Owner (Maintenance Manager) will review the system’s design and test results to confirm that the internal controls meet SOX requirements. A formal sign-off document will be completed, certifying that the business accepts the solution and its embedded controls.” This ensures accountability – essentially the BPO is attesting the solution does what’s needed for compliance. If there’s a control owner separate from BPO, mention them too.
    
*   **Security Testing & Reviews:** Note if there will be a security assessment (like penetration test or at least IT security review) before deployment. Also, if applicable, mention any specific **cybersecurity controls** like vulnerability management (e.g., “the app will be scanned with Microsoft’s PowerApps Checker or other tools for any security issues prior to release”).  
    Organize these as bullet points or short paragraphs under subheadings if needed.
    

**Example:**

*   _Data Classification:_ The data managed by this app (inspection records of company assets) is classified as **Internal**. It does not directly contain financial statement data but does feed into operational metrics that can influence financial decisions (e.g., asset health affecting capital expenditures). Thus, accuracy and integrity are important. No personal identifiable information (PII) is stored except employee IDs (corporate).
    
*   _Authentication & User Access:_ Users access the app via **Azure AD SSO**, with **MFA enforced** as per company policy. Technicians and supervisors are pre-authorized via security groups. The app will **not be accessible outside the corporate network** except through managed devices (this is enforced by Intune policies on the tablets).
    
*   _Authorization & Segregation of Duties:_ Role-based access is implemented. **Technicians** can create inspection records but cannot approve them. **Supervisors** can approve/reject but cannot create records for themselves. This enforces segregation of duties – a key SOX control to prevent a single person from completing a process end-to-end without oversight[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=will%20have%20in%20common%20with,and%20even%20corporate%20governance%20controls). Additionally, only designated supervisors (one level above technicians) are given approval permissions, ensuring managerial review of work.
    
*   _Audit Trail:_ The system keeps a detailed audit log. **Dataverse Auditing** is turned on for the Inspection and Approval tables, recording all changes. Every submission and approval action is automatically timestamped and tied to a user ID. These logs are read-only and periodically exported to secure storage for retention. This addresses SOX requirements for evidencing control effectiveness over financial-related data (accuracy, completeness of records)[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=administered%20by%20the%20Securities%20and,changes%20related%20to%20financial%20reporting). During audits, these logs can be provided to show who performed and who approved each inspection, and that no unauthorized edits occurred.
    
*   _SOX Financial Control Consideration:_ While an inspection app is not directly a financial system, it supports a **key control**: ensuring that required asset inspections (which can impact financial decisions like asset depreciation or investment) are completed and reviewed. Thus, the following controls are implemented in the app design:
    
    *   **Completeness Control:** The app requires all fields to be completed and will not allow submission if any mandatory data is missing. This ensures completeness of data captured for each inspection[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=customer%E2%80%99s%20internal%20processes%20especially%20when,changes%20related%20to%20financial%20reporting).
        
    *   **Accuracy Control:** The app includes validation rules (for example, acceptable range checks for readings, dropdowns to prevent invalid entries). Also, by pulling asset info from a master list, it avoids free-text errors. These reduce errors in recorded data.
        
    *   **Approval Control:** Each inspection record must be approved by the maintenance supervisor electronically. The system enforces this by marking new records as “Pending Approval” and only after a supervisor’s approval does it mark them “Approved”. This electronic sign-off is equivalent to a supervisor’s signature on a paper form, fulfilling the oversight control. The **Business Process Owner (Maintenance Manager)** will review samples of these records during UAT to ensure the approval workflow meets internal control expectations.
        
    *   **Exception Handling:** If an inspection fails approval (rejected due to issues), the system flags it and requires resolution (either re-inspection or data correction with supervisor oversight). This ensures issues are not ignored – a control to maintain data integrity and follow-up.
        
*   _Compliance & Standards:_ The design aligns with the **COSO Internal Control Framework**, focusing on control activities and information & communication components. For IT general controls (ITGC), the app relies on the established controls of the Power Platform and Azure AD (access provisioning, change management, etc.). For example, deployment to production will go through Change Management (CAB approval), ensuring proper change control – which is an ITGC often audited under SOX. We also adhere to **COBIT** principles for IT governance, ensuring that the app’s lifecycle is managed and documented[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=Though%20they%20may%20not%20be,best%20practices%20to%20their%20organizations).
    
*   _Security Testing:_ Before go-live, the Cybersecurity team will perform a **security review** of the app and flow (checking for any insecure configurations, verifying least privilege access, etc.). Any findings will be addressed. Additionally, because this is a low-code solution, reliance is placed on Microsoft’s security (the app is built on a platform that has SOC 1 Type 2 attestation which covers internal controls over financial reporting[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=Even%20though%20there%27s%20no%20SOX,AICPA%29%20Statement%20on)). However, our organization remains responsible for **configuring controls correctly and monitoring them**[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=At%20Microsoft%2C%20we%20share%20the,part%20of%20your%20SOX%20compliance). The BPO and IT will establish a periodic review (e.g., every quarter) of user access rights and audit logs, to ensure controls continue to operate effectively.
    
*   _Business Process Owner (BPO) Sign-off:_ **Before deployment to production, the Business Process Owner (Jane Doe, Maintenance Manager)** will sign off on a control checklist confirming that: (a) the app’s workflow meets the required business control (supervisory approval), (b) audit trails are sufficient, and (c) all compliance requirements are met. This sign-off will be documented and stored for audit evidence. The BPO’s sign-off indicates acceptance of the system from a process controls perspective and is required by our SOX governance process. The PRD (this document) will be one of the artifacts reviewed and approved by the BPO and IT Compliance before go-live.
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Consult with the Compliance/Audit team to identify which SOX controls (if any) are relevant to this application. Determine if the application will be in scope for SOX 404 testing.
    
*   Consult with the IT Security team to gather applicable security requirements and policies (like password/MFA policies, data encryption needs, logging requirements, etc.).
    
*   Classification of data should be confirmed via the company’s data classification policy and possibly involve the Data Governance team.
    
*   The Business Process Owner should be involved early to define what controls they need to see in the system (e.g., if they have existing control narratives for the manual process, use those to implement equivalent digital controls).
    
*   Check if there are any corporate standard controls or frameworks to align with (many companies have an Internal Controls Framework document – see if any control objectives map to this system).
    
*   Make sure you have the list of standards/regulations the system must comply with (besides SOX, possibly internal IT policies, NERC CIP if dealing with grid control systems, etc., and data privacy laws if any personal data is involved).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** This section aligns with ensuring **regulatory compliance** and should reflect best practices from frameworks like **COSO** (for financial controls) and **ISO 27001/NIST** (for security controls). Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) specifically emphasizes internal controls over financial reporting[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=administered%20by%20the%20Securities%20and,changes%20related%20to%20financial%20reporting), so documenting controls such as access restrictions, approvals, and audit trails demonstrates compliance readiness. It’s considered best practice to involve internal audit or compliance experts when designing systems that touch financial processes, to ensure all necessary controls are in place[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=SOX%20IT%20Controls%20and%20Cybersecurity). Common SOX-related controls include **access controls, segregation of duties, change management, backup, and data integrity checks[auditboard.com](https://auditboard.com/blog/sox-controls#:~:text=will%20have%20in%20common%20with,and%20even%20corporate%20governance%20controls)**, all of which are covered in our instructions above. We also referenced that Microsoft’s cloud services provide SOC reports to help with SOX compliance[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=Even%20though%20there%27s%20no%20SOX,AICPA%29%20Statement%20on) – leveraging such certified infrastructure is a plus, but the onus is on us to configure the app correctly[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox#:~:text=At%20Microsoft%2C%20we%20share%20the,part%20of%20your%20SOX%20compliance). Ensure that any control described here is also traceable in the requirements or design (and eventually in testing). From an agile standpoint, even if we work iteratively, compliance requirements are **non-negotiable** – they must be built into the product from the start. Having a dedicated section for these in the PRD is aligned with audit requirements and will assist **Auditors and Cyber Security Risk Analysts** in their evaluation of the solution (as they specifically will look for evidence of these controls).

## 10\. Implementation Plan & Timeline

**Purpose:** Outline the high-level plan for implementing and delivering the product, including key milestones or phases. This provides transparency on how the project will be executed in time, which is useful for coordinating with stakeholders and setting expectations. It also helps identify any time-sensitive requirements (like regulatory deadlines) and ensures alignment with the agile delivery approach (iterations, sprints, etc.).

**Instructions:** Provide an overview of the project timeline. Even in an Agile/XP setting, it’s helpful to list important dates or phases. Possible inclusions:

*   **Project Phases or Sprints:** If you have defined phases (e.g., Phase 1 - MVP, Phase 2 - enhancements) or you’re planning by sprints, describe them. For example, “Sprint 1 (Jan 5 - Jan 19): build core data entry form; Sprint 2: add approval flow; Sprint 3: user testing and refinements; Go-Live: March 1.” Alternatively, if not working in formal sprints, outline major chunks like Design, Development, Testing, Training, Deployment, each with target dates.
    
*   **Milestones:** Key events like _“PRD approved”_, _“Development complete”_, _“User Acceptance Testing (UAT)”_, _“Go-live”_, etc., with dates. Include any gate reviews if relevant (like security review or audit review dates).
    
*   **Deliverables per milestone:** Optionally, note what will be delivered at each milestone (e.g., prototype demo, documentation, training materials ready, etc.).
    
*   **Timeline Diagram or Schedule:** You could present a simple timeline chart if needed (but text is fine).
    
*   **Release Criteria for Launch:** Tie this to timeline – e.g., “Before go-live on March 1, the following must be true: 100% of test cases passed, BPO sign-off received (by Feb 25), training delivered to all users (by Feb 28), etc.” This ensures all pre-launch checks align with the timeline.
    
*   **Post-launch support plan:** Briefly mention what happens after go-live in terms of hypercare or support timeline if applicable (e.g., “First two weeks after go-live will have daily check-ins with field users and quick bug fixes if needed”).  
    Keep this section relatively high-level; it’s not a full project plan, but enough to give context of how the work is planned. If dates are not fixed, you can mention timeframes (e.g., Q4 2025 for pilot release). For agile, emphasize the iterative nature if appropriate (“We plan to pilot with one region in first release, then roll out to others in a subsequent release based on feedback.”). If no hard deadlines, state that the timeline is flexible but include expected duration of major tasks.
    

**Example:**

*   _Project Start:_ **Jan 10, 2025** – Project kickoff, PRD completed and approved by stakeholders by end of January.
    
*   _Development Sprints:_ **Feb 2025 to Mar 2025** – Three 2-week sprints using XP practices (pair programming, test-driven development):
    
    *   _Sprint 1 (Feb 1 – Feb 14):_ Build the core Canvas app screens for data entry and basic data model setup in Dataverse. Deliverable: working form with offline capability demo.
        
    *   _Sprint 2 (Feb 15 – Feb 28):_ Implement Power Automate approval flow and supervisor interface in app. Deliverable: end-to-end submission and approval working in dev environment.
        
    *   _Sprint 3 (Mar 1 – Mar 14):_ Refine user interface, add validations, implement audit logging, and conduct internal testing. Deliverable: feature-complete app in UAT environment.
        
*   _User Acceptance Testing (UAT):_ **Mar 17 – Mar 28, 2025** – Key users (5 field techs and 2 supervisors) will use the app in a test environment with sample data. Feedback will be collected daily and minor fixes performed. **SOX control testing** by Internal Audit will occur in this period too (they will verify that approval workflow and logging meet requirements).
    
*   _Security Review:_ **Mar 20, 2025** – IT Security to perform final review (penetration test and policy compliance check). Any critical issues will be resolved by Mar 25.
    
*   _Training & Documentation:_ **Mar 24 – Mar 31, 2025** – Develop quick reference guides and conduct training sessions for all 50 intended users. Training by a combination of online video and a live demo session.
    
*   _Go-Live (Production Deployment):_ **Apr 1, 2025** – The solution will be deployed to Production environment. This will happen during a scheduled maintenance window (approx 1 hour downtime for initial data load). BPO and Project Sponsor sign-off required by Mar 30 to proceed.
    
*   _Post-Go-Live Support:_ **Apr 1 – Apr 30, 2025 (Hypercare period)** – The project team (developer and a support analyst) will closely monitor usage, respond to any issues, and ensure all inspections in April are successfully recorded. Weekly check-ins with the Business Process Owner to address any user concerns or requested tweaks.
    
*   _Phase 2 (Future Enhancements):_ (Tentative) **Q3 2025** – If phase 1 is successful, plan to integrate with Asset Management System in real-time and add a Power BI dashboard for management. These are out-of-scope for now, but targeted for later in the year pending approval.
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   A rough estimation or sizing of the work (perhaps done with the team) to ensure timeline is realistic.
    
*   Identification of dependencies that could affect schedule (e.g., availability of test users for UAT, or waiting on IT to provision an environment, etc.).
    
*   Knowledge of any fixed deadlines (for example, “we want this live before end of fiscal year” or “must be in place before next audit in June”). If none, stakeholder agreement on a reasonable timeframe.
    
*   Team availability and resource confirmation (e.g., developers, testers, users who will do UAT, trainers).
    
*   Organizational change management considerations (ensuring users will be ready by that date, any labor agreements if this changes their workflow, etc.).
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Even in agile projects, having a timeline or release plan is recommended for transparency[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=PRDs%20typically%20include%20the%20following,features%2C%20release%20criteria%2C%20and%20timeline)[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=,review%20and%20approve%20the%20document). Agile focuses on flexibility, so this timeline may be updated as you progress; however, setting target milestones helps coordinate especially in a corporate environment. Many organizations follow a hybrid approach where iterative development is done but a **release date** is still targeted. Ensure that any date for go-live considers necessary compliance approvals – for instance, if internal audit needs to sign off, include that in plan (we did). For projects subject to oversight, stage gates (like “PRD approved”, “UAT sign-off”) often map to company standards – you can reference that (e.g., “per IT governance, a go-live requires Security and BPO approval – reflected in our milestones”). If you want to align with Scrum, you might call out sprint reviews or retrospectives, but those internal ceremonies usually need not be in the PRD. The key is communicating to stakeholders when they can expect to see results and what the key checkpoints are. Using a simple Gantt chart or milestone list is common. Since this document may be read by auditors or future staff, documenting the timeline also provides historical context (“When was it implemented? How long did it take?”). Lastly, ensure the timeline is **realistic** and account for testing and buffer – a rushed timeline that skips testing or security review would raise red flags. It’s better to under-promise and over-deliver, aligning with good project management practice.

## 11\. Risks, Assumptions & Dependencies

**Purpose:** Identify potential risks that could impact the project or the successful operation of the product, as well as any assumptions made during planning and dependencies on external factors. By listing these, the team and stakeholders can proactively manage and mitigate issues. This section is crucial for transparency – especially for future operations and audit, as it shows due diligence in anticipating challenges[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=11.%20Risks%20and%20Mitigations%20,industry%20standards%2C%20and%20legal%20requirements).

**Instructions:** Break this into two parts: **Risks** and **Assumptions/Dependencies**.

**Risks:** List key risks along with their potential impact and mitigation strategy. A risk could be related to project execution (schedule, resources) or product performance (technical, adoption, etc.). Use a bullet or table format. Optionally, note the likelihood (high/med/low) and severity of impact. For each risk, briefly state how you plan to mitigate or monitor it. Examples of risks for this scenario:

*   _Risk:_ **Field users might resist adopting the new app** (change management risk). _Impact:_ Low usage could lead to continuation of old process, negating benefits. _Mitigation:_ Include field technicians early in development and UAT to get buy-in; provide adequate training and support; make sure the app UX is convenient (e.g., offline capability addresses one potential source of resistance).
    
*   _Risk:_ **Offline data sync issues** – if the offline sync doesn’t work perfectly, data could be lost or duplicated. _Impact:_ Loss of inspection data would be a compliance issue. _Mitigation:_ Thorough testing of offline scenarios; use Power Platform offline best practices; possibly have a manual backup process (e.g., if sync fails, data is saved and retried, and users are alerted to ensure connectivity).
    
*   _Risk:_ **Dataverse storage limitations or costs** if a lot of data (photos can consume space). _Impact:_ Running out of space could stop the app or incur extra cost. _Mitigation:_ Monitor storage usage; enforce photo size limits in the app; enable a retention policy (e.g., archive or delete non-essential data after X years).
    
*   _Risk:_ **Integration delay with Asset Management data** – if the daily feed fails, the app might not have the latest asset info. _Impact:_ Techs might not find new assets or might use outdated data. _Mitigation:_ Set up alerts on the data pipeline; if feed fails, instruct techs via comms to manually enter needed info or delay inspections; long-term consider a more robust integration or double-check within app.
    
*   _Risk:_ **Security breach or misuse** – although unlikely, if a user’s account is compromised, someone could access or alter data. _Impact:_ Could undermine the integrity of records. _Mitigation:_ Rely on corporate security (MFA, monitoring); audit logs will catch unusual activity; implement least privilege so even a compromised tech account can’t approve, etc.
    
*   _Risk:_ **Project timeline risk** (e.g., “If key developer is pulled to another project, delivery could slip”). _Impact:_ Delay in go-live. _Mitigation:_ Cross-train another team member on the app; keep management informed of resource needs; possibly reduce scope if needed to meet must-have date.  
    Each risk should ideally have an owner (who will monitor it) – though that level of detail is optional here.
    

**Assumptions & Dependencies:** List any assumptions made in this PRD or project plan. These are conditions you expect to be true but might not be guaranteed. Also list external dependencies that the project relies on. Examples:

*   _Assumption:_ Users will have corporate tablets with internet connectivity **at least once a day** to sync data. (If this proved false – e.g., some remote areas with no connectivity for a week – it would affect the solution).
    
*   _Assumption:_ The data in the Asset Management system (equipment list) is accurate and up-to-date, so that we can rely on it for our asset dropdowns. We assume the Assets list is maintained by another team.
    
*   _Assumption:_ The organization’s Power Platform environment is appropriately licensed (we assume we have the needed Power Apps and Dataverse licenses for all users). If licensing is not in place, project costs or feasibility might change.
    
*   _Dependency:_ **Asset Management data feed:** The project depends on the IT integration team to set up the daily data feed from Maximo to Dataverse by testing phase. Delay in that integration could impact our testing and data accuracy.
    
*   _Dependency:_ **Azure AD group setup:** We need the IT IAM (Identity Access Management) team to create and populate the Azure AD groups for “Maintenance Technicians” and “Maintenance Supervisors” before UAT, or we cannot properly test role-based access.
    
*   _Dependency:_ **User availability for UAT and training:** We rely on the maintenance department allocating time for some technicians and supervisors to participate in UAT and training. If they are not available (due to peak work, emergencies, etc.), our testing schedule might slip or be less thorough.  
    For each dependency, mention the party responsible and the expected delivery. For assumptions, it might be wise to note what happens if they fail (contingency if possible).
    

**Example:**  
**Risks:**

*   _Field adoption risk:_ Medium likelihood – Technicians might find using a tablet cumbersome initially. **Mitigation:** Provide hands-on training and initial on-site support. Emphasize management support for the new process (i.e., old paper method will be phased out to encourage use).
    
*   _Offline data loss risk:_ Low likelihood (Power Apps offline is robust if used properly) but high impact. **Mitigation:** We will implement local data saving after each form page. In case of app crash, data remains on device. We’ll test worst-case scenarios (battery die, etc.). Additionally, instruct users on procedure if a sync error happens (don’t uninstall app, call IT support to recover data file).
    
*   _Timeline risk:_ Medium likelihood – The integration development by another team might be delayed. **Mitigation:** If the Maximo integration isn’t ready by UAT, we will load a static asset list as a stopgap. The go-live can proceed with a static list (assuming asset list changes are minimal in short term), and live integration can be rolled out later. Communicate frequently with that team and have a backup plan (manual CSV import) ready.
    
*   _Security risk:_ Low likelihood – If a user’s account is compromised or a disgruntled insider attempts misuse. **Mitigation:** Rely on company’s SOC (Security Operations Center) monitoring for unusual behavior. All critical transactions (approvals) are logged and reviewable. Also, the principle of least privilege ensures even if misused, one cannot, for example, approve their own inspections or delete records without trace. Regular access reviews will be conducted (quarterly by the BPO) to remove or adjust permissions as people change roles.
    
*   _Data volume risk:_ Low – We expect ~500 inspections/month, which is fine. If usage grows beyond predictions or more data (like more photos), we might hit storage or performance limits. **Mitigation:** Monitor usage metrics. We have budget allocated for additional Dataverse capacity if needed. We can also implement an archiving strategy (e.g., move older than 2 years records to a separate storage) if performance becomes an issue.
    

**Assumptions & Dependencies:**

*   _Assumption:_ All field technicians will have a compatible device (Company-standard tablet with the Power Apps app installed and updated). We assume IT has distributed devices and they are in good working order. **Contingency if false:** If some technicians lack devices, the department will provide shared devices or revert to paper for those individuals until devices are procured – but this would reduce the effectiveness, so we highlight it to management to ensure devices are ready.
    
*   _Assumption:_ The maintenance supervisors have basic computer skills to use the app on desktop. (They currently use email and Excel, so this seems valid.) If additional training is needed, we will accommodate that.
    
*   _Assumption:_ The regulatory environment remains the same during the project. (For instance, no new surprise compliance requirement emerges that would alter scope.) If something like a new regulation on digital record-keeping comes up mid-project, change control will be invoked to address it.
    
*   _Dependency:_ **Integration team delivers asset data feed by Mar 1, 2025.** Our plan relies on that data feed; a delay means we use a manual data import as Plan B. We’re coordinating with Integration Team Lead (John Smith) who has agreed to this timeline.
    
*   _Dependency:_ **Internal Audit availability for SOX testing in UAT.** We need an auditor to verify our controls in late March. This has been scheduled with Internal Audit, but if they are pulled away (e.g., due to another urgent audit), it might delay our sign-off. We have a commitment from the Audit Manager for a resource (Jane Doe from audit) to do this review. If she’s unavailable, we will seek a sign-off based on our own tests and get audit review post-go-live (not ideal, but as a fallback).
    
*   _Dependency:_ **Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE) approval.** Our organization has a CoE governance that reviews new apps for compliance with standards. We have submitted an overview to them. Approval is needed by mid-March. We assume this will be routine given we followed guidelines; if CoE raises issues, we have time in late March to address them.
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Risk identification should be done via a brainstorming with the project team and possibly stakeholders. Ensure to cover project management risks, technical risks, user adoption risks, and compliance risks.
    
*   Assumptions should be reviewed – get a peer or stakeholder to challenge them (“Is this really true or are we just hoping?”). Clarify any uncertain assumption by either confirming it or planning a mitigation.
    
*   Check dependencies with the owners: have explicit agreement or at least awareness from those external parties (e.g. integration team, audit team, CoE). Ideally, capture their commitment in writing or meeting minutes.
    
*   Determine risk mitigation actions and owners – who will track each risk. Often the project manager or product owner will maintain a risk log; this section is a snapshot of the important ones.
    
*   Update this section as things change – for example, if a risk is resolved or an assumption proven wrong, the PRD (if maintained through the project) can note that or be updated.
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Identifying risks and assumptions is part of good project governance (PMI and PRINCE2 methodologies emphasize a risk register). In agile, teams often discuss risks in retrospectives or planning, so documenting them keeps everyone aware. IEEE and other SRS standards often have a section for **assumptions and dependencies**, understanding that requirements might hinge on them[press.rebus.community](https://press.rebus.community/requirementsengineering/back-matter/appendix-c-ieee-830-template/#:~:text=2). By listing assumptions, you make it clear what conditions the solution relies on – if those change, requirements might need revisiting. For risks, referencing a standard risk management framework like **ISO 31000** or simply following common practice (likelihood/impact assessment) is useful. The key is to show that the team has proactively considered what could go wrong and has plans in place[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=11.%20Risks%20and%20Mitigations%20,industry%20standards%2C%20and%20legal%20requirements). This is especially reassuring to stakeholders like project sponsors or auditors. Additionally, by including this section, future teams maintaining the product can see what issues were anticipated (for instance, they’ll know we worried about storage limits – so if in 2 years they face it, they realize it was known and there might be an archive plan in place). Remember to revisit and revise risks as the project proceeds – the PRD can be a living document, or you might manage risks in a separate log. In any case, the major ones should be captured here for completeness and accountability.

## 12\. Glossary and References

**Purpose:** Provide definitions for any acronyms, technical terms, or domain-specific terminology used in this document, and list references to any external documents or standards that were consulted. This ensures that all readers share a common understanding of key terms and know where to find more information if needed[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=12.%20Glossary%20and%20References%20,industry%20standards%2C%20and%20legal%20requirements). It is especially useful for new team members, auditors, or anyone not intimately familiar with the project’s context (e.g., a cybersecurity analyst reviewing it might need to know business terms, and a business user might need technical term clarity).

**Instructions:** List important terms alphabetically (or in logical grouping) with a brief definition for each. Also list any reference documents or links at the end. Include:

*   **Acronyms:** (e.g., _BPO_ – Business Process Owner, _SOX_ – Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, _MFA_ – Multi-Factor Authentication, _UAT_ – User Acceptance Testing, _CoE_ – Center of Excellence).

*   _Agile Best Practices for Requirements_ – e.g., Atlassian’s article _“Product Requirements Documents Explained”_ which emphasizes shared understanding over exhaustive detail[atlassian.com](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements#:~:text=Summary%3A%20A%20product%20requirements%20document,launch%2C%20or%20market%20the%20product)[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=While%20lengthy%2C%20highly%20detailed%20product,a%20comprehensive%20PRD%20is%20essential), and Perforce’s _“How to Write a PRD”_ which guided the inclusion of purpose, features, and stakeholder review[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=,review%20and%20approve%20the%20document).
    

**Prerequisites:**

*   Ensure all uncommon terms in preceding sections are captured here. As you write the PRD, maintain a list of terms/acronyms that a newcomer might not understand.
    
*   Verify definitions with subject matter experts if needed (e.g., confirm the phrasing of what SOX means with the compliance officer, ensure technical definitions are correct per official docs).
    
*   Gather any documents or links referenced. If linking to external sites or internal sharepoints, ensure the reader will have access (or mention where they can find it).
    
*   Decide on the level of detail: don’t define common English words or ubiquitous terms, but err on the side of clarifying anything that could be misunderstood.
    
*   Update the glossary if new terms come up during the project.
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Including a glossary is recommended in many documentation standards to avoid confusion[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=12.%20Glossary%20and%20References%20,industry%20standards%2C%20and%20legal%20requirements). It is especially helpful in cross-functional projects where business and technical terms mix. For example, IEEE standards often have a “Definitions” section. Keep definitions concise and objective. For references, providing sources adds credibility and allows interested readers (like auditors or new team members) to dig deeper into certain topics. Ensure that any standard or framework mentioned in the document is cited here (we cited COSO, COBIT, etc., so we listed them). This also demonstrates that the team used established frameworks and materials – a sign of due diligence. If there are too many acronyms, consider also including a quick acronym list at the very top of the document for convenience. Since this PRD might be used over years, having references means future readers can contextually place decisions (e.g., knowing which version of a policy or standard was relevant at the time of writing). Always prefer linking to official documentation or widely recognized sources for definitions (for instance, linking to Microsoft or standard bodies) to ensure accuracy.

## 13\. Approvals & Revision History

**Purpose:** Record the approval of this requirements document by key stakeholders and track any revisions made to it. Approval indicates that stakeholders (business and technical) have reviewed the requirements and agree that they are accurate and complete. Revision history ensures that changes to the document are logged, maintaining an audit trail of how requirements evolved (important for governance and traceability).

**Instructions:** Include a table or list of who needs to approve this PRD and a place for their sign-off (could be an electronic approval or a signature if on paper, depending on your process). Typical approvers might include:

*   **Business Process Owner (BPO)** – confirming the requirements meet business needs and controls (especially for SOX compliance).
    
*   **Product Owner / Project Sponsor** – representing the business side sponsorship, agreeing to proceed with what's described.
    
*   **IT Lead/Architect** – confirming the technical feasibility and alignment with IT standards.
    
*   **QA or Testing Lead** (optional) – acknowledging that requirements are testable and clear.
    
*   **Compliance/Security Officer** (if required) – confirming that compliance requirements (SOX, security) are correctly captured.  
    You can have a sign-off line for each, with name, role, date, and maybe a signature. If the approval is captured in a system (like an ALM tool or document management system), you can note that instead of physical signature.
    

Also include a **Revision History** table that lists versions of the document, date, author, and summary of changes. This is useful if the PRD is iteratively refined (which in agile, it might be updated as things change). Example entries:

*   Version 0.1 – Draft – Jan 5, 2025 – Initial draft by \[Author Name\], under review.
    
*   Version 0.2 – Jan 20, 2025 – Updated scope and added SOX compliance section after review with BPO.
    
*   Version 1.0 – Feb 1, 2025 – Baseline approved version for development start (approved by BPO, IT, etc.).
    
*   Version 1.1 – Mar 15, 2025 – Revised after UAT feedback (minor changes in requirements X and Y), approved by stakeholders for final.  
    Each entry should have just enough detail to know what changed. If this document is maintained, any future changes (like adding Phase 2 requirements) would also be recorded.
    

**Example – Approvals:**

| **Name & Role**                       | **Signature**         | **Date**    | **Comments**                               |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Jane Doe – Maintenance Manager (BPO)  | _Jane Doe (signed)_   | Feb 1, 2025 | Approved – covers SOX controls needed.     |

_(The above is illustrative; actual entries would reflect your project’s change events.)_

**Prerequisites:**

*   Decide on the required approvers per your organization’s governance. (Perhaps check a PMO or QA checklist; highly regulated environments often have mandated approvers for requirements).
    
*   Get commitment from those approvers to review the document by a certain date. Possibly hold a walkthrough meeting to get everyone on the same page before they sign.
    
*   For revision history, ensure version numbering is agreed (some use 0.x for drafts, then 1.0 for first approval, etc.). Use a consistent format (date, names, etc.).
    
*   If the document is living, establish where updates will be stored and how re-approvals will be handled (some organizations require re-approval for significant changes, others for any change, etc.).
    
*   Ensure the final approved PRD is stored in a repository accessible to the team and auditors (e.g., SharePoint or a project folder), with version control.
    

**Standards/Best Practices:** Having formal sign-off is critical in many processes, especially when compliance is involved. It ensures accountability – for example, **stakeholder review and approval is explicitly recommended as part of a good PRD process[perforce.com](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd#:~:text=,review%20and%20approve%20the%20document)**. It’s also mirrored in best practice lists[savioglobal.com](https://savioglobal.com/blog/business-analysis/product-requirements-document-prd-template-and-examples/#:~:text=progresses,in%20and%20avoiding%20future%20conflicts) that emphasize validation and approval by key stakeholders before development. The revision history is part of good documentation practice (ISO/IEEE documentation standards include a revision history at the start or end). This not only helps in audits (proving that changes were controlled) but also helps the team itself track changes. In agile contexts, you might think continual changes conflict with sign-off, but even agile teams often “baseline” certain documents and then manage changes via backlog grooming. Treat the PRD similarly – baseline it, then handle changes through a controlled process (could be as simple as documented consent via email for minor tweaks, or formal re-sign for major scope changes). Recording those changes keeps everyone aligned and provides a narrative of the project’s evolution. Auditors and future maintainers will appreciate seeing that, for instance, “version 1.1 included UAT feedback changes” – it shows that the team was responsive and methodical. Conforming to any internal QMS (Quality Management System) or PMO requirements for documentation approvals will likely require this section, so it’s included to meet those standards.
