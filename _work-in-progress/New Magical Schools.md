### Skepticism
This group embodies the idea that nothing can be truly known and emphasizes the importance of an open mind.

1. **{Entropy} (Chaos)**: You deal with the unpredictable elements of decay, rebirth, and the manipulation of probabilities. The inherent uncertainty and your reliance on forces of disorder align with your skepticism that challenges the predictability of outcomes.
   - Level 1: Sense Fate & Fortune - As a Disciple of {Entropy}, you learn to examine each thing and discern its strengths and weaknesses, understanding what it is and what it does. You begin to sense the current of Destiny, and can discern what is significant and what is not, and what is true or untrue. Given this knowledge, you can pick a winning horse, sense if a lock has some defect, or choose the original between two identical items. These insights are not perfect, just advanced.  Unreliable as it may be, your ability to judge certainties and likelihoods is quite useful. Pressure points, lies, and opportunities become obvious to you once you know their patterns. This may not have any dramatic effects, but once you understand an enemy's strengths and weaknesses, it doesn't take Sun Tzu to determine a combat strategy or Lucrezia Borgia to figure out a subterfuge.
   - Level 2: Control Probability -  Now that the threads of Fate have been identified, the dominos of Fortune may be pushed. You learn control over probability by studying where it concentrates. Phenomena as diverse as card shuffling, dice rolling, market fluctuations, traffic jams, lost mail, and roulette wheels teach you to identify order in chaos, chaos in order, and the paths of probability.  This gives you amazing, yet subtle control over hundreds of small events. You can control whom a waiter will serve first, who picks the shortest straw, who wins a coin flip, or finds the one bullet in a chamber, etc. You may determine the outcome of any minor event that would normally be random. Once you discern which apparently random events are in fact predetermined, you can then manipulate other eventualities to your own ends.  There's a limit to this control; the greater the probability you try to affect, the more difficult the act becomes. Determining the toss of the same coin 100 times in succession becomes correspondingly more difficult. Hexing a pack of cards to deal a royal flush is in the realm of possibility, but ordering a shuffled deck such that each card comes out as if it had never been shuffled is a miracle probably not worth the bother.
   - Level 3: Affect Predicable Patterns - Inanimate objects and tangible forces, as Patterns of order, are most subject to the forces of Entropy. Machines are especially susceptible to this phenomenon. Clocks wind down, engines break, warranties expire, and all things eventually fray and decay. As a Disciple of Entropy, you can "fix" this deterioration, causing new television sets to blow a fuse while old junker cars mysteriously still run years after they should have fallen apart. Rocks may also be caused to erode and teapots to chip and shatter, but as entropy is a slow and gradual process, the only things which can be affected instantly are those, such as machines, which have thousands of intricate moving parts.  As with Rank Two, you are still limited by the realm of possibility. The more unlikely a feat, the more difficult it becomes, and the less time and bother it's worth. Order can only be fixed and Entropy kept at bay for so long before things follow their natural course.  Mystic mages view this process as cursing or blessing an object, or laying a Destiny upon it. Such forces can be controlled; at this rank, you may imbue a physical object with probability energy by adding Life 2 or Matter 2 to the spell, affecting the course of its Destiny and of those who come in contact with it. A blessed locket may take a bullet intended for its wearer, though you may later die a glorious death in battle. Time 2 allows more of a say in such events, but even then, they may not be certain.
   - Level 4: Affect Life - The effects of Entropy, order, and probability are far more complex when dealing with living organisms, due to their complex and self-corrective nature. If a robot overtaxes itself and stresses its workings, it runs down until someone repairs it. A person who overtaxes themselves will heal given time and care, and may even grow stronger. As an Adept of Entropy, you study how life forms begin, mature, wither, and die. You also observe the hundreds of factors which affect the course of life, from the effects of heredity to the stresses of evolution and growth. You learn how to influence the random factors of life, giving you immense power either to destroy it or affect its development. With this magic, you can weave a potent spell over a living being, blessing or cursing them and their line. Other Spheres may be woven into such a charm, creating hereditary magical gifts or flamboyant curses. These arts affect probability, not Life Patterns themselves.
   - Level 5: Affect Thought - As a Master of Entropy, you expand your control over reality by studying the ways in which ideas change over time. The effects of the natural order of things on objects are fairly clear and indisputable, but the fact that chaos affects intelligent thought may seem farfetched. Yet everything which is organized is subject to the laws that govern order and chaos, be it the structure of a molecule or an organized body of knowledge. You, as a Master of Entropy, point to human history for countless examples of theories and paradigms that outgrew their usefulness over the centuries. Thoughts, you point out, are at once the most mercurial and the most tenacious things, yet as any politician can tell you, they can be molded, shaped, and influenced over time. Where the Masters of Mind rudely subject the minds of others to their own will, you as a Master of Entropy merely point out things that will strike a person a particular way and let their thoughts follow the natural progression to other possibilities. A Master of Entropy who specializes in chaos can shatter a person's worldview simply by making a few bizarre comments (or at least confuse them), while those specializing in order can present logical arguments which can advance a person's conscious or subconscious thoughts to some higher (or at least different) set of ideas. Masters who specialize in Fate or Fortune can lead subjects to inescapable conclusions or spark random, creative thoughts, which a subject may absorb as they see fit. This supreme magic directs the force of Wyrd into a mental concept, creating a "happy thought" or "cursed idea," which brings Fate or Fortune to bear on those who concentrate upon it, possibly extinguishing or exalting the thought. This may lead to paradigm shifts, new faiths, or insanity.
   - **Pros**: Emphasizes uncertainty and change, fitting the skeptical view of continuously questioning and challenging known patterns.
   - **Cons**: The cycle of decay and rebirth could be seen as a predictable, reliable process, which might align it more with Faith.

2. **[Rifts] {Correspondence} (Gates)**: You challenge the notion of space as a fixed concept, introducing a mystical element to the manipulation of space and distances.
   - Level 1: Immediate Spatial Perceptions - At this stage, you gain a keen understanding of how objects and space relate. You can intuitively sense distances between objects, find true north (or any other direction), and sense things in your immediate vicinity without using the normal five senses. 
   - Level 2: Sense and Touch Space - You can now extend your senses beyond your immediate vicinity to distant or hidden locations. Any of your five senses can expand this way. However, most mages feel that such magical perceptions thin the barriers between the two points in space, creating a weakness in reality. Fortunately, you can also re-work the fabric of space, reinforcing reality and creating a barrier to hinder scrying or the opening of actual rifts. This is a contested skill test.  In conjunction with {Life} or {Matter}, you can also grasp small items—house cat-sized or smaller—and pull them through reality, conjuring them from "nowhere."
   - Level 3: Pierce Space, Co-Locality Perception - You now gain the strength to make a small hole in reality, so small that only you—and whatever you hold or carry—may slip through before it seals. You may also seal such holes or prevent them from opening, though the greater the hole, the more difficult it will be to close.  At this level, you learn to sense multiple locations at once, perceiving the various scenes as several ghostly landscapes overlapping one another. Working with other Spheres, you may also grasp items governed by the {Pattern Magicks} and slide them through space, performing levitation and telekinesis.
   - Level 4: Rend Space, Co-Locate Self - You can now create larger rents in reality to transport other beings and large objects and forces. With enough success, you may even force the hole wide enough to make a permanent Gateway. You can now manifest physically in multiple locations at once, though you should also use {Mind} if you want to think effectively in all of them, and {Life} if you want your multiple selves to perform separate actions.
   - Level 5: Mutate Space, Co-Locate Others - As a Master of {Correspondence}, you learn how to distort space. You can affect distances and sizes around you, stretching and shrinking them to fit your needs. In scientific terms, the mass of objects cannot be changed, but their volumes and dimensions are like potter's clay.  You may also stack locations on top of one another in a bizarre landscape of multiple forms or connect a variety of items together. At this point, your perceptions are so wildly expanded that your mundane Perception may be enhanced beyond the normal human maximum.
   - **Pros**: Merges the concrete understanding of space with the fantastical ability to alter it in unpredictable ways.
   - **Cons**: The ability to control and manipulate space might also lean towards a more skeptical or even faith-based view depending on interpretation.

3. **Time ()**: You embrace the concept that time is as subjective as space and matter, fitting well with your skepticism as it challenges the conventional understanding of time as a linear, absolute entity.
   - Level 1: Time Sense - Most such effects are small ripples which either speed up or slow down time relative to the space outside. A few are referred to as skips, small rifts that lead forward in time, but some may actually be "loops," rifts into the past. It's generally considered unwise to simply step through either one, and by the time you've taken the opportunity to look forward in time to see where the rift leads, time has passed and the rift has sealed. These rifts seem fairly rare today, though they appear to go in historical cycles, like comets. The late Victorian age, for example, seemed to have had an unusual number of time-based phenomena, as did several other ages, while other eras, like the 1930s, had almost none. It's said that stasis causes such skips - the more stable the times, the more often those times move themselves.  At this level, you may also detect temporal phenomena weaker than actual rifts. The spots where a Master steps forward in Time, or sends something forward, display a distinct irregularity in the flow of the continuum, while places which have been used to scry the future—or will be used for scrying the past—display a twist in the ribbon of time.
   - Level 2: Past and Future Sight - You can now shift your perceptions forward or backward in time. Postcognition tends to require more successes to perform, but its results are certain (or at least considered so by most). Precognition is less difficult to enact, but the futures foreseen—especially far futures—tend to be inaccurate. Most mages believe the future is constantly changing. Anytime you look forward, you simply foresee the most probable future. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy—or defeats the vision's purpose. Through the act of foreseeing the future, the future may be changed. If you predict the manner of your own death, you can then avoid that circumstance. This very phenomenon makes the future unknowable (Fate Masters have their own thoughts on the subject). Mages commonly use this magic with conjunctional Effects. Entropy 1 allows you with future sight to view multiple probabilities or possible futures. You may add Entropy 2 as a conjunctional Effect to choose one. The most probable futures are the easiest to pick, and the least likely the most difficult. Most mages also mix Correspondence 2 with this rank of Time, because by itself, this rank only allows you to look forward or backward into the past of your current location. With Correspondence 2, you may scry out any time and any place in the world. Looking into time can be quite dangerous. Just as there are guardians for certain parts of space and the spirit world, so are there guardians for certain segments of time and certain bits of knowledge. Seeking the secret incantations of the Priests of Mu can be risky; such rites were no doubt guarded by potent spirit entities. Those guardians are still there, waiting for anything that strays too close—including Peeping Toms from the future. Thus, peering into the past is not a magic for the idly curious. Some mages reverse this magic and thicken the walls of time around some particular instant, making an action that much more difficult to discern from the future (or foresee from the past) and theoretically preventing time travelers from interfering as well. Each success you get on this sort of magic subtracts from a future (or past) success of some other mage to spy on your present doings. Some sorcerers cloak themselves in a wall of thickened time, preventing other mages from locating their future whereabouts. Mages who frequently extend their perceptions through time tend to experience spontaneous flashes of pre-or-postcognition. These flashes range from feelings of déjà vu to vivid, dreamlike trances foretelling danger.
   - Level 3: Time Compression or Extension - You can now exert your will over the passage of time, causing it to accelerate or slow as you desire. Mystics often describe these effects as "contracting" or "dilating" time, referring to the length of each moment in time. Thus, contracting time around a waterfall makes it appear to flow more slowly to an outside observer; near the waterfall, each moment does not last as long and less water flows. Conversely, by dilating each moment around the waterfall, more water flows during each segment of time. While the observer perceives these moments to pass normally, he will see more water flow during each moment. Working this magic conjunctionally with Correspondence 3, you can allow a moving object to go at any speed without gaining additional momentum. Likewise, by dilating Time dramatically enough, you can effectively travel forward in time. If you shut yourself in a hidden room of a castle, for example, then work a spell so that only one day passes inside the room while 100 years pass outside, you have effectively traveled forward in time. There are risks (war, fire, demolition) during the intervening years, but most mages will have already divined the future of the sanctity of the hiding place, so that should not be much of a problem. This is, however, a one-way street, and no one can prove the wisdom of following it...
   - Level 4: Time Shift - You are now able to cause absolute shifts in time, rather than simply adjusting the rate at which time passes. You can take a field of time and freeze it; a falling arrow may be stopped mid-flight or a person placed in a state of suspended animation.  This is a powerful effect when used in conjunction with other magics, as you can choose the moment in time which "triggers" the magical time bomb. Some long-dead Masters of Time have left the world a legacy of magical effects that occur even after the mage's death. Such "hanging" effects are the type of time-based phenomenon that mages with Time Sense can intuitively detect.  When mixed with Entropy, such spells gain a contingency effect. For example, a suspended animation spell could have a Sleeping Beauty clause, ending it at the kiss of a prince instead of at a set instant in time. Other magical effects can also be worked into the temporal program as subroutines, to use the Virtual Adept term, so long as that effect, and its trigger, are set in advance. The more unlikely the trigger effect is, however, the more difficult it is to incorporate. By setting certain things in place— "This wall will turn to fire when someone leans on it (Matter 3/ Forces 3/ Prime 2/Time 4)"—entire artificial systems of magic ("Words of Power" and so forth) can be created with "clap on/clap off" functions, making reliable static magic that anyone with the appropriate keys can access. To keep such stored magic from being stolen by enemies, many Time Adepts have used Matter and/or Life to tie these to heirlooms and/or bloodlines, leaving their descendants a legacy of magical abilities. Eventually, of course, the magic is used up or the heirlooms are lost, so nothing lasts forever. Such "contingent" effects can be detected with the first rank of Time or Entropy, though it takes Time 2 to truly fathom the effect's nature.
   - Level 5: Time Travel, Time Immunity - At Master-level knowledge, you can do more than determine the timing of events; you can shift objects through time. You actually pluck something out of the flow of time and reposition it at some other point along the time stream. The new position could be seconds or centuries away from the original place in time. Masters say such effects are "anchored," or firmly linked to their point of origin. A ripple exists in the time stream at the point of their disappearance until their reappearance. This forms a continuous thread which you can pull at any time you see fit. For example, a mage who sent her house forward into the future to keep it from being destroyed by a war succeeded in pushing it forward 50 years. Five years after the original magic, the war ends, so she grasps the ribbon and pulls the building back out of the time stream prematurely. You may also do the same with yourself, moving forward through not just the possible but the actual future, until you find a point in the time stream when you decide to disembark. Theoretically, this anchored effect could be used to travel into the past as well; it's assumed that the Oracles of Time use this method (if they travel in Time at all), as would any Masters who have discovered the means. Even anchored future travel is not without its risks; such arts are obviously vulgar, and any Disciple of Time can recognize an anchored time effect and gauge the time when it will come due, while a Master can reach into the time stream and pull out another traveler. Masters can also immunize themselves from time. Figuratively speaking, the Master simply steps laterally out of the current temporal flow. He can maintain his immunity only so long, but during his "time" outside of Time, he perceives the world as a statuesque collection of still images that he may manipulate as he pleases. As a conjunctional effect with Life or Matter, he may take other creatures and objects "out of time" as well, and may even abandon them in the frozen moment. It seems such a state cannot last forever, and subjectively the creatures appear only moments later, but some reappear dead of old age, having passed hundreds of years in a timeless hell.

   - **Pros**: Encourages a re-evaluation of one of the most fundamental aspects of reality—time itself.
   - **Cons**: Mastery of time manipulation might imply a degree of reliability and control, suggesting an element of Faith or Mystery.

### Faith
This group represents the belief in reliable, consistent principles or entities that one can depend upon.

4. **Prime (ARcane)**: You engage with the quintessential reality, suggesting an underlying, dependable structure to reality that can be manipulated and relied upon.
   - Level 1: Sense Magic - You gain perceptions of basic quintessential energy. You can perceive the Nodes where it collects or wells up, the ley-lines and dragon paths which traverse the globe between them, the Tass in which it crystallizes, and the Quintessential ebbs and flows which mark the Junctures, the times of greatest magic. You may also notice creatures and objects charged with magical energy, though you need Mind to perceive their particular auras and Spirit to detect their souls (assuming they have them). Perceptions of Prime vary from mage to mage. Some see it as a clear, pure light or a shining matrix of white energy. Others perceive it as a dark and primal force, the Black Egg, and see a matrix of black against gray. Others claim that it is a distinct color, neither black nor white—a magical color out of space—while some mystics hear it as the music of the Spheres or describe it as a tingle of magic in the air or a current flowing around them. By sensing the strongest currents of Odyllic Force, you may align yourself so that they flow into your own Pattern, charging your Avatar. Without the first rank of Prime, you cannot store free Quintessence within your own Pattern beyond the amount you receive from your Avatar. Mages without Prime magics cannot gain Quintessence ratings above their Avatar Background Trait.
   - Level 2: Harmonize Magical Energy, Fuel Magical Pattern - You attain some control over the shifting Patterns of Prime force and Quintessential energy. You can divert small streams to flow differently—through the cosmos or weave them to create Platonic ideals, items composed solely of Quintessence and visible to those with magical senses. Such items exist in the etheric, spiritual, and astral planes (the High and Middle Umbral Worlds alike). When you conceive of an object, it takes on some degree of solidity. By channeling Prime Force through your concept, you can transform it into a physical form. Creating things out of "thin air," then, obviously demands Prime 2.
   - Level 3: Channel Magical Energy - At rare sites (Nodes) and on rare days (Junctures), quintessential Force focuses into Primal energy. The resulting flow is called "free" Quintessence and assists mages working enchantments, casting spells, or creating Horizon Realms, new items, Chantries, or Talismans. At this rank, you understand how to draw these "surplus" energies out of the Patterns in which they are stored. You become a conduit of Quintessence, storing it in your own being or channeling it into other Patterns, like your Chantry's pocket Realm. For lack of a better term, mages describe Quintessence as either "raw" or "free." The terms are for classification only; there's no real difference between the two. Raw Quintessence makes up Patterns, flows through living beings, and coalesces in the tremendous pool of Quintessence from which mages draw the energies for Pattern magick. Free Quintessence is surplus Prime that can be manipulated and transferred. Raw Quintessence energy grants life or form to everything, from a lightning bolt to a chipmunk. Free Quintessence is the extra power held by a mage as part of his Quintessence trait. If that trait goes to zero, the mage still has the raw Quintessence that allows him to live and be human. Sadly, free Quintessence can only flow from one established Pattern into another. No one has successfully tapped into the "pool" of free Quintessence described under Prime Rank Two, or even drawn extra Prime Force from this large pool when creating new Patterns or fueling them with Quintessence. That is to say, when you create an object, you can only siphon enough Quintessence to make the object—no surplus Quintessence remains in anything you create from scratch. The special properties which allow free Quintessence to flow from Pattern to Pattern are beyond even the Masters of Prime. If the Oracles of Prime know more, they have said little. There seems to be a definite limit to the free Quintessence that exists on Earth, and Chantries battle fiercely for control of this precious commodity.
   - Level 4: Create Magical Energy - While as a Disciple of Prime you are largely limited to detecting and manipulating free Quintessence, as an Adept of Prime, you learn to channel raw Quintessence. You can pull Quintessence out of the Patterns of matter and energy, affecting a Pattern's substance in reality. Each shard of inanimate matter and each spark of energy has Quintessence stored within. You can expel the Quintessence from these Patterns, recycling it into the cosmic pool of raw Quintessence. Without Quintessence in its Pattern, that matter or energy ceases to exist.  If you know enough about Matter or Forces, you can use conjunctional Effects to alter the amount of Quintessence stored in various parts of these Patterns, thereby "dissolving" different aspects or properties of the energy or matter. You could make solids become insubstantial, cause a magnet to have only one pole, remove a chemical's ability to form nuclear bonds with other chemicals (this process would, for example, make an acid unable to corrode), or cause objects to lose their mass yet remain solid. While Pattern magicks alone can do the same thing, extracting a target's raw Quintessence is a direct and "easy" way to alter it.
   - Level 5: Control Magical Energy - As a Master of Prime, you delve into truly advanced theories. You can alter established flows of raw Quintessence—those flowing through Life Patterns.  Living beings interact with Quintessence in a unique manner. Their Quintessence is not stored in their Patterns but runs continuously through them. By damming this flow, you can extinguish the spark of life within the creature. You can also increase the flow of Quintessence through a Pattern. This means nothing to life forms without strong Avatars, but Awakened ones can instantly recharge their Avatars' Quintessence. Some Masters of Prime also claim to have found connections between Paradox and Quintessence, like those between negative and positive forces. This breakthrough allows these mystics to channel free Quintessence in ways that cancel "random" Paradox energies.
   - **Pros**: Emphasizes order and the fundamental aspects of reality, aligning with the notion of underlying truths.
   - **Cons**: The ability to manipulate these fundamental truths might also introduce an element of Mystery.

5. **Transgressive/Spirit (Theurgy)**: You are involved in the study and interaction with divine entities and the sacred, which are typically accepted on faith and seen as reliable spiritual truths.
   - Level 1: Sense / See Spirit Word - As a Spirit initiate, you gain the ability to sense the Near Umbra around you. You can see auras, ghosts, and spirits, especially those your own Avatar is most attuned to through Resonance. Some mages are better at seeing wraiths and the Dead, others at seeing the spirits of Nature. All spirit-mages can sense these, especially in areas where the Gauntlet is thin, but you might find it easier to deal with creatures on the same spiritual wavelength as yourself.  As a Disciple of Spirit, you can also "read" the strength of the local Gauntlet, testing it for weaknesses, and discern an item that has spirit essence, like a Garou fetish or an awakened object or location.
   - Level 2: Touch Spirit, Interact with Spirit World - You now gain the ability to briefly touch spirits and objects you can see on the other side of the Gauntlet—the Penumbra. You can pick up a fetish stick dropped by a Garou, push a spirit out of a room, or even hit one over the head with an object from the spirit world, as the spirit may do nothing to stop this unless it possesses the Gift which allows it to manifest on the other side of the Gauntlet. Although this contact is limited (lasting only a turn or two), it can be enough. At this level, you can also extend your Spirit touch and make your voice heard through the Gauntlet. You may use this ability to call any spirit known to you, or even put out a general call to any spirit nearby. Every Tradition has methods and rituals to accomplish this, but they are all, in essence, just variants on the classic séance. As with the séance, at this level, attendance is optional, but most spirits will show up, if only out of curiosity or annoyance. To make crossing more hospitable for the spirits, you may use your power to thin the Gauntlet, making it easier for spirits to crossover into the physical world and manifest, assuming they have the Charm. Each success on a magical Effect roll lowers the Gauntlet difficulty by -1 for one turn; three successes would lower it by -3 for three turns. Naturally, this must first succeed against the original Gauntlet rating. This only works so well, however—the Gauntlet cannot be brought lower than difficulty 4. You can also strengthen the barrier, making it harder for spirits to enter the physical world—a useful effect for mages who've called up something they shouldn't have. (See page 270 for the Gauntlet Chart.) With work, you can also extend your perceptions to plumb the Deep Umbra and detect the fringes of eternity.
   - Level 3: Enter Spirit World, Rouse & Lull Spirit - You can now make a hole in the Gauntlet, allowing yourself to enter the Umbra, a feat called "stepping sideways" by the Garou. Your body and possessions are translated into ephemera, the stuff of spirit, but will possess a certain glow, which the more aware denizens of the spirit realm will recognize as belonging to a living being. At this level, any action you take against an Umbrood creature, physical or otherwise, will be felt. Once in the Penumbra, you can go anywhere you like, up to the borders which mark the Horizon between the Near and Deep Umbrae.  Translating possessions, however, is more difficult without additional successes. Entering skyclad (nude) requires only the usual successes at the usual difficulty. Normal clothing and items add +1 to both difficulty and successes needed. Bulky gear—backpacks, rifles, large drums—demand a +2 increase. You cannot bring through anything you could not normally carry.  With conjunctional Matter 3 and Prime 2 Arts, you may create short-lived items out of ephemera. These creations—knives, tents, boars, etc.—must be built as if they were material items, and fade away when the Effect's duration ends. Until then, such items are as strong as any "real" object would be. You also gain the power to rouse spirits. According to many philosophies, most spirits are asleep. Rousing is like calling, simply louder, and will rouse not only those spirits who have been quiescent for a long while but those who have never awakened before. (Note that this has no relation to magical Awakening.) Depending on your diplomatic skills, the spirit may be anywhere from curious to furious.  You may also use this same magic to lull an awakened spirit, such as one residing in a fetish, though the more powerful the spirit, the more difficult it is to put back to sleep. A talen (one-use fetish) would require three successes, while a powerful Bane-dagger would demand at least eight. Such slumber lasts for the spell's duration.
   - Level 4: Rend Spirit Word, Repair Spirit World, Bind Spirit - You can now rip the fabric of the Gauntlet asunder, and you—along with anyone else who wishes to, mortal or spirit—can travel through without difficulty. This is, of course, highly vulgar; most polite (and sensible) mages will seal the breach after they and their friends pass into the Umbra. You can also repair breaches that others have made in the Gauntlet and reinforce the barrier's fabric to make it that much harder to tear.  You can now compel spirits to appear and bind them into obedience. The Umbrood may also be forced into objects to create fetishes, which use their powers at your behest. Such trinkets often have a single use only, based on the nature of the spirit that was bound. The more powerful the spirit, the more successes it takes to bind them. Few will stand still for this...  This sort of magic is, of course, considered very antisocial in the spirit world (if not outright black magic). Mages who do this too often tend to get a reputation.  A brave (or foolish) shaman may also channel a spirit's powers through herself. This shuts out any other magic you might perform while the Umbrood possesses you, though you can access its Charms, speak with its voice, and perform feats of incredible physical prowess. Regaining control is sometimes a problem, though—many spirits enjoy riding mortal hobby-horses and must be forced out through contested Willpower rolls (difficulty 7-10) or the reverse of this same power—exorcism.
   - Level 5: Forge Spirit World - As a Master of Spirit, you gain a divine power, for you can now take ephemera, the substance of Spirit, and reweave it in whatever fashion you desire, repair it or rip it asunder.  You can now heal spirits' Power (as per the Damage chart), help create Horizon Realms or Umbral Domains, or even attack a victim's Avatar through the dreaded Gilgul rite. This always vulgar magic is considered the last resort when dealing with an enemy mage; it not only robs a mystic's power, it destroys his soul. Such magic is exceedingly difficult, and its rites are highly guarded. (Lest it be abused, let players know that anyone who overuses this power may well end up its victim. Gilgul, even in the worst possible cases, is never taken lightly.)   You may also use your power to break free from the Horizon and explore the Far Realms. No longer must you rely on the tenuous connections within Domains to travel to the Outer Realms. You are able to traverse the Deep Umbra, surviving the ravages of Etherspace for short periods, while you speed through it towards your chosen destination. Masters of Spirit are said to spend years at a time on their outward journeys, charting the Tellurian and studying the denizens of other Realms.
   - **Pros**: Directly involves faith-based concepts such as divinity and miracles.
   - **Cons**: The mystical aspects could also place it within Mystery due to its synthesis of the known and unknown.

9. **[Life] {Lif}e (Animism / Shamanism / Physical Adept)**: You combine the scientific understanding of biological patterns with the mystical and spiritual aspects of life force and spirit interaction.
   - Level 1: Sense Life - The mage begins his study by identifying Patterns of Life. By reading these Patterns (however his philosophy defines this), he can learn a lot about a life form - its age, its sex and every aspect of irs health. With this awareness, the mage can also sense different forms of life nearby.
   - Level 2: Alter Simple Patterns, Heal Self - Life manipulation begins with the simplest living patterns. You can now alter the structure of basic life forms, from microscopic viruses and bacteria to creatures as complex as insects and shellfish (as a good rule of thumb, any invertebrate is considered a simple Life Pattern). All plant life, from algae to sequoia trees, possess Life Patterns simple enough for you to manipulate. At this level, you can only influence these simple patterns; you can heal simple creatures or kill them, cause crabs to sprout extra legs, trees to bear fruit, or bees to release the pheromones which signal a swarm. Whatever you do, the creatures themselves remain what they always were—you can mutate them, but cannot transform them. A cherry tree is still a cherry tree (even if it now bears poisonous fruit), and a luna moth is still a luna moth (even if it now has a four-foot wingspan).  You also begin to understand the most complex Patterns of Life, starting with the one most familiar to you, your own. At this stage, you may only correct (or create) breaks in your pattern to heal or harm yourself as you desire.
   - Level 3: Alter Self, Heal Life, Transform Simple Patterns, Create Simple Patterns - At this rank, you can alter your own pattern, making subtle improvements and variations beyond simple patterns as at Life 2. You cannot substantially change what you are (a human), but you can change your gender or appearance or physically modify your body to grow claws, fur, gills, etc. Simple patterns are now yours to command; you may turn them inside-out, change one into another, or even create them entirely from other patterns, through conjunctional effects involving Forces, Matter, or Prime. You can change wildfire into wildflowers, glass grapes into living fruit, or the Platonic ideal butterfly into its living counterpart. Unfortunately, any life form you create has no mind beyond what it held before. However, for simple life forms, especially plants, this fault is virtually irrelevant. Even creatures such as crabs or insects can be imbued with some instinctive reflexes that serve for intelligence in the absence of a true mind. You begin to understand other more complex organisms now and may heal (or harm) other people as you did yourself at the previous rank.
   - Level 4: Alter Complex Life Patterns, Transform Self - At this rank, you can change the structure of any complex Life Patterns, including those of other sentient beings. As with Life 2, the creatures subjected to this magic still retain their original form, but radical variations on their basic form are still possible. As a Life Adept, you can alter your form to resemble another living being of approximately the same size and mass. You may become a deer, but not a mouse. Special abilities—such as water breathing, flight, etc.—do not carry over at this level without additional Life Effects, and moving around in the new form will take some getting used to. More naturalistic Traditions compensate for this shortcoming by working instinct into the basic form. However, a mystic risks losing their mind entirely this way. Some have found themselves trapped in the shape of panthers or dolphins and have only freed themselves when they encountered something that reminded them of what they truly were.
   - Level 5: Transform Complex Life Patterns, Create Complex Life Patterns, Perfect Metamorphsis - As a Master of Life, you can transform others as you transformed yourself at the previous rank. At this level, you can attain any form you desire and alter others in the same way. This carries its own challenges. A higher being transformed into a lower one tends to trade intelligence for survival instincts, while a lower life form changed into a higher one encounters similar issues. A dog transformed into a bodyguard might be faithful, but not terribly smart, and a turnip transformed into a dinner date would still be a vegetable in mind, if not body. Getting such creatures to stand on two legs, let alone speak, requires a long period of instruction or a conjunctional Effect with Mind 3 (fewer successes needed for the dog, many more for the turnip). The perfect metamorphosis you achieve as a Master has no such issues. When you shapeshift at this level, you carry your mind and arts with you. Whatever you become, that form is as natural as the one you were born into. At this level, you also gain a most unique power, which some might regard as divine: you can weave a new Pattern to create any life form, even a human body, using conjunctional magic to translate it from energy, matter, or pure Quintessence with the appropriate rank of Forces, Matter, or Prime. Unfortunately, the life form created has no mind or soul beyond the base material or the Resonance it carries. A painting might be haunted by the ghost of its subject, and you who caused her to step out into life might find a perfectly capable woman (with her own agenda) greeting you, while a handgun changed into a hamster might become a particularly stupid, yet bloodthirsty, hamster. Consequently, many mages prefer to create a new being out of Prime Force, certain that it possesses no mind or soul beyond what the mystic gives it. This might seem pointless, but mages have found various uses for such soulless shells. Some create new forms of life merely to study how new "improvements" might affect their living bodies, while others imbue these soulless life forms with preprogrammed reactions that mimic instinctual intelligence. The Progenitors have a "damage control" division which creates beasts whose only instinctive drive is to kill, then unleashes them against their enemies. Empty husks make ideal resting places for spirits and astral forms as well. Most spirits can manifest in an empty body (or even possess occupied bodies) and interact with the physical world. A mage who helps an Umbrood across this way can demand favors and expect to get them. Masters of both the Life and Mind Spheres can untether their psyches and create new bodies for their own astral forms to fill, while those adept at Spirit have devised a form of life insurance that involves reincarnating in new bodies when the old ones die. Such mages often leave a long trail of different identities behind them, attaining a degree of immortality.
   - **Pros**: Perfectly synthesizes the known biological sciences with the mystical aspects of spiritual energies and life forces.
   - **Cons**: The tangible aspects of biological life could align it more closely with Faith due to the reliability of biological laws.



### Mystery
This group synthesizes elements of both Skepticism and Faith, dealing with the unknown and the known in equal measure.

7. **{Matter} ()**: You handle the tangible and often predictable patterns of inorganic matter, but the flexibility and manipulation of these patterns introduce an element of the unknown.
   - Level 1: Matter Perceptions - As a Disciple of Matter, you begin by recognizing the various Patterns of Matter, including the underlying structures that give objects their shapes and physical properties. With these perceptions, you can detect things hidden from normal senses. In addition to sensing the composition and properties of Matter, you can discern structures hidden within structures; material no longer forms a barrier to your senses.
   - Level 2: Basic Transformations - You can transmute one substance into another without changing its shape, temperature, or basic state (solid, liquid, gas). If you follow mystic traditions, you can change milk into cream or mahogany into oak, while as a scientist you might change water to acid or lead into gold. The more radical the transmutation, the more successes the spell requires. It's easier to change water into wine (one success) than into sulfuric acid (three), and more complicated to turn stones into bread (three successes) than sourdough into rye (one).  With an understanding of Prime and the other Pattern Magicks, you can use conjunctional Effects to transform items governed by Forces, Life, or Prime into basic Patterns of Matter, including changing living beings into stone or spinning moonlight into thread. With Prime 2, you may harness the ether to create (or uncreate) any simple, basic thing composed of one common homogeneous substance. A quartz boulder shaped vaguely like a woman is possible, but a dainty china shepherdess is not. With difficulty, a stick of plastique could be conjured (but not the detonator), though a couple of plutonium spheres are out of the question (the highly radioactive elements cannot be created until Rank 5). A bowlful of oatmeal or even blueberry pancakes could be made to appear, but not a baroque wedding cake. The more rare and/or complex a given substance, the more difficult it is to create from pure ether. It's easier to create glass than diamonds and simpler to make flour than bread. Elaborate creations must wait until Rank 4. Making things hotter or colder than they were originally, or changing one substance into another with a higher or lower potential energy, requires a conjunctional Effect with Forces, though Matter alone can change ice into ice cream or boiling water into hot soup. Transmuting solids into liquids or liquids into gas requires either Matter 3 or the use of Forces 3/Prime 2 (or some mundane means) to boil or freeze the affected substance.
   - Level 3: Alter Forms - At the third rank of Matter, you can finally overpower the rigid Patterns of reality. By selectively altering different aspects of an object's Pattern, you can change its shape however you desire—compressing it to increase its density and decrease its volume while retaining the same weight, inflating it to decrease its density and increase the volume, or temporarily changing the state, so that solids become liquids or liquids become gases. Permanent changes in state require Rank 5. You, who understand this rank, may sculpt matter into any shape you please, limited only by the physical properties of the materials you use. Broken items may also be repaired seamlessly, provided you have the mundane knowledge to do so.
   - Level 4: Complex Transmutations - As an Adept of Matter, you can now perform radical changes to physical materials and craft complex and intricate items involving several common substances or one or two rare ones. Any sort of regular matter may be changed into any other—for example, a squirt pistol into a loaded zip gun (three successes) or a trash dumpster into a small tank (five successes). However, as with Rank 2, the more radical the transformation, the more difficult the feat.  With conjunctional Effects, the Patterns of Life, Forces, or Prime itself may be transmuted into Matter, allowing you to turn pumpkins into gilded coaches, lightning bolts into swords, or the Quintessential ether into master keys. Complex organic creations are also possible, including silk ballgowns, roast chickens, and Persian rugs.
   - Level 5: Alter Properties - At this pinnacle of understanding, as a Master of Matter, you may create new substances that do not exist in nature by taking existing materials and altering their physical properties, such as boiling or melting points, density, ductility, transparency, viscosity, and refraction index. You may even make one object immaterial to some other substance, creating bullets that can phase through armor and killer robots that can walk through walls, leaving the walls intact.
   - **Pros**: Blends the predictable nature of physical matter with the creative and unknown possibilities of its manipulation.
   - **Cons**: Could potentially fit into Faith due to its reliance on physical laws.

2. **Mind (Metaphysics)**: You focus on the complexities of sentience and the mysteries of the human mind, exploring subjective experiences that cannot be fully understood or quantified. This aligns with your skeptical view of questioning perceived realities.
   - Level 1: Sense Thoughts and Emotions, Empower Self - You begin to sense the thoughts and emotions in the air around you. You cannot yet read these thoughts, but can sense their strength and intensity. This is not a true look at the soul (that requires Spirit 1) but at the shell of emotional radiance that surrounds it.  You may also read the psychic impressions left on objects. At this stage, you cannot read any actual thoughts or images, but can sense "good" or "bad" vibes from an object or place. This includes the Resonance attached to Tass or the aura of a Quintessential wellspring at a Node or Juncture. Without Prime 2, you can't tell how strong such energies may be, but you'll be able to understand the best uses for such Quintessence (see the modifiers chart for details).  As a Mind initiate, you also learn to influence your dreams and shield yourself from the inevitable mental barrage of others' thoughts and emotions. With work (a magick roll), you can hide your aura and shield your thoughts from casual observation—though determined and perceptive mages and other beings may still be able to read them.
   - Level 2: Read Surface Thoughts, Mental Impulse - You learn not only how to recognize thoughts but also how to read them. You can read memories "attached" to objects by others' minds (basic psychometry) and scan surface thoughts from unshielded minds. The greater the emotional content, the louder the "volume" and the easier it is to read such impressions. You can also leave the same psychic impressions on objects or places intentionally, "creating" Resonance. You can also send such thoughts and emotions out ("looking daggers" or "blowing kisses") until they find their target. Complex thoughts cannot be sent this way, but single words, images, or emotional impulses can be easily "beamed" into an unshielded being's subconscious mind. Such suggestions are much more insidious, and can often be more effective, than direct communication.  Two mages of the same rank can also form a primitive mental link by dropping their shields and reading each other's conscious minds. You may also create more elaborate shields in your mind and disguise the color of your aura, or erect complex mental "window dressing" to fool other mentalists into underestimating or ignoring you. You can also control your dreams to some extent, though many aspects still lie beyond your influence.
   - Level 3: Mental Link, Walk among Dreams -  You can now establish a clear link between your own consciousness and the minds of others. You can use this link for telepathic communications—or invasions.  The ability to project thoughts and images into another's mind allows you to project false perceptions. At this rank, you have full command of perceptual illusions. Some Traditions teach methods of projecting psychic disturbances into a subject's mind. These psychic assaults take many forms, but their end goal is to turn the victim into a mental vegetable.   You may now contact the minds of other dreamers in your sleep and begin to explore the Dream Realms. While awake, you may also use your abilities to enter the dreaming consciousness of others, though such trips are risky. Some Sleepers have particularly rich dream lives, and even a mage who enters one may be at the dreamer's mercy. A number of spiritual entities also lair in these dreams and may be very territorial.
   - Level 4: Control Conscious Mind, Astral Projection -  As a Mind Adept, you can actually take over another person's mind and occupy his body for your own ends. His thoughts, should you will it, are not his own, but yours. Once this invasion has begun, you may control your victim directly, cure or cause insanity, change his memories, or set up posthypnotic suggestions. You can overlay your subject's aura with another of a completely different color and pattern. The victim may slowly recover as the subconscious mind reasserts the true memories, but the subject's Demeanor is usually irrevocably altered. You can also leave your dreams behind and make brief excursions into the astral reaches (Skimming the Penumbra; see "The Otherworlds," Chapter Nine). These trips must be short and can become dangerous. For each success you roll, you may leave your meditating body for one turn. Afterward, you return to your physical self.
   - Level 5: Control Subconscious, Forge Psyche - As a Master of Mind, you rule not only your own mind but other minds as well, both mortal and spirit. Through this power, you can invade not only the conscious mind but the subconscious as well, completely rewriting the underlying personality until the thoughts which compose the psyche bear no resemblance to anything that existed before, utterly changing the person's nature. The only integral part of the being which you may not touch is the Avatar and its memories of past lives, for to perform this ultimate crime requires the Sphere of Spirit. You may also separate a psyche from the body, switch minds between subjects, and merge, copy, or transfer the entire sum of a person's memories and knowledge from one body to another. Your powers allow you to increase a subject's intelligence and wits to genius levels (5 dots) and may begin to increase your own beyond that (though not without risk; see "Better Body"). Complete astral travel is also possible now, and you can leave your body for hours or even days at a time. You must eventually return, however; complete astral existence transcends anything a mortal mage can know. The greatest power of a Master of Mind, however, is the ability to create true conscious thought. You may create another thinking, rational mind where none existed before, expanding its intelligence and designing its personality however you like. Computers and other inanimate objects—as well as the empty shells created by Masters of Life—may be given true sentience without granting them a soul. When such creatures are destroyed, however, their psyches tend to die with them as well.  
   - **Pros**: Involves questioning and exploring the unknown aspects of consciousness, which are always open to interpretation and new insights.
   - **Cons**: The study of the mind also involves gaining knowledge and insights, which could lean towards Mystery as it synthesizes unknowns with new understandings.

6. **Forces ()**: You deal with manipulating natural forces, and your understanding and predictability of these forces (like gravity, electricity) provide a reliable framework for your magic, thus fitting the Faith category.
   - Level 1: Perceive Forces - You discern the movements of energy. By identifying their Patterns, you can perceive all types of energy flows, sensing wavelengths far beyond the limited range of visible light and sonic frequencies upon which normal mortals rely. You may see anything from infrared light to X-rays to gravity waves. Even in the absence of such positive forces, you have learned how to perceive colors in darkness, sense stillness, and hear volumes from silence.
   - Level 2 Control Minor Forces - All the positive forces are essentially the same—sound, light, heat, etc.—as are the negative forces (or their absence, to use the Technocracy's definition)—silence, darkness, cold, and so on. While you, at this level of understanding, cannot fundamentally change either positive or negative energies, you can exercise some degree of control over their ebb and flow.  Sound and silence may be sent in different directions, allowing you to disguise your voice, eavesdrop at a far distance, or cloak yourself in a field of silence, sending the sound of your footfalls far into the ground. Light and darkness may be bent and refracted, focused and diffused, allowing you to change apparent colors, displace your image, wrap yourself in shadows, create a mirage, or focus a flashlight into a fine laser. Heat and cold may be shuffled about, warming one thing while chilling another, while other forces may be controlled in a similar manner, including gravity, electricity, magnetism, and all manner of radiation.  The amount of energy that can be controlled at this level is limited. You controlling electricity with this knowledge could short-circuit a car or a house, but not an apartment building or a power plant. One controlling light or darkness could black out a house, but not a city block, and a mage controlling kinetic energy might deflect a bullet or change the vector of a skateboard, but could only slow, not stop, a Mack truck. The larger the force to be controlled, and the degree of that control, the more successes the spell demands. A candle flame can be made to flare with only one success, but a bonfire requires five or more, and to make a flame dance or form pictures requires even more successes. To control greater forces requires Forces 4.
   - Level 3: Transmute Minor Forces - You can now change one force into another, flip positive into negative, or create or destroy forces as you like, summoning them out of thin air and dissolving them into the same. With this level of Forces alone, you may change one force into another. Radiation may be transformed into sound, kinetic motion to electricity, heat into cold, or light into darkness.  With a conjunctional Effect with the Spheres of Matter or Life, you may transmute things of those Spheres into a Force of the strength governed by this level.  Alternatively, you may reweave ambient Quintessence (with Prime 2) into one of the baser forces or transform base energy into pure ether. Both Aristotelian alchemy and modern science teach that energy and matter are, at essence, the same thing. With this magic, you may transmute the elements—even changing invisible ether into physical force and summoning such force from "nowhere." The amount of Forces that can be created by use of this level is limited as with Forces 2, but with enough success, you with this power can now freeze enemies solid or incinerate them on the spot, blow up cars, fly through the air, levitate alligators, and erase reams of data with a magnetic pulse. With Life 4, you may even transform yourself into a being of living fire or lightning, a shadow, or a chill in the air.
   - Level 4: Control Major Forces - This power works like Forces 2 above, but the maximum for that level is the minimum for this one. With enough successes, the degree of power you may wield with Forces 4 is frightening. You may focus the light of the sun into a laser cannon or cloak football stadiums with prismatic illusions, redirect missiles mid-flight, send shockwaves the other way, banish a thousand shadows into a single corner, and melt glaciers while lakes are frozen solid. Most of these effects, of course, are quite vulgar, so there are restrictions. You could, of course, also use this level of understanding to guard yourself and others from the fury of these forces—to fireproof forests, protect ships from storms, and so on.
   - Level 5: Transmute Major Forces - This level operates like Forces 3 above, but with enough successes, the degree of power you may access is almost limitless. Technomancers have used this knowledge to unleash the power of the atom and create nuclear explosions, but luckily consensual reality, common sense, and counter-magic limit careless uses of this ability. Some powers are still beyond the scale of this level of Forces, although some mages strive to master them (including the sorceress Louhi, of Finnish legend, who is still—unsuccessfully—attempting to put out the sun). Large effects require many successes, as well as logic—it's easier to brew a storm during monsoon season than in the middle of a drought, for example—but as a Master of Forces, you may conjure hurricanes, firestorms, tidal waves, earthquakes, and nuclear blasts.
   - **Pros**: Relies on the predictable laws of physics and natural forces.
   - **Cons**: The manipulation of these forces could also suggest a control that borders on Mystery.


Here are the five levels of magical power, rewritten using the concept of governance and stewardship, along with verbs of Germanic etymology. Each level includes practical examples from the nine spheres of magic you provided:

### Level 1: **Sense** (from Old English *sēns*, from Proto-Germanic *sinnan*, to perceive)
At this level, you begin your stewardship by perceiving and understanding the foundational aspects of magic. For instance:

- In **Prime**, you sense magic.
- In **Spirit**, you see the spirit world.
- In **Forces**, you perceive natural forces.
- In **Matter**, you perceive the essence of matter.
- In **Correspondence**, you gain immediate spatial perceptions.
- In **Life**, you sense the life forces around you.

### Level 2: **Shape** (from Old English *sceapen*, from Proto-Germanic *skapjan*, to create)
As you grow in knowledge, you shape and adjust elements and energies:
- In **Entropy**, you control probability.

- In **Spirit**, you enter and influence the spirit world.
- In **Forces**, you transmute minor forces.
- In **Matter**, you alter forms.
- In **Correspondence**, you achieve co-locality perception.
- In **Life**, you transform simple life patterns.

### Level 4: **Craft** (from Old English *cræft*, from Proto-Germanic *kraftaz*, strength, skill)
Your skills now allow you to craft new realities and major transformations:
- In **Entropy**, you affect life.
- In **Mind**, you control the conscious mind.
- In **Time**, you perform time shifts.
- In **Prime**, you create magical energy.
- In **Spirit**, you rend and repair the spirit world.
- In **Forces**, you control major forces.
- In **Matter**, you achieve complex transmutations.
- In **Correspondence**, you co-locate yourself.
- In **Life**, you alter complex life patterns.

### Level 5: **Govern** (from Old English *governan*, from Proto-Germanic *gubernan*, to control or direct)
At the pinnacle of your powers, you govern the realms you interact with, exerting total control:
- In **Entropy**, you affect thought.
- In **Mind**, you forge the psyche.
- In **Time**, you govern time through travel and immunity.
- In **Prime**, you control magical energy.
- In **Spirit**, you forge the spirit world.
- In **Forces**, you transmute major forces.
- In **Matter**, you alter properties at will.
- In **Correspondence**, you mutate space and co-locate others.

### Practical Paradox

By Paul Strack

The Paradox rules in 2nd Edition Mage are amazing. So few changes, yet such a dramatic improvement on the original. I can't help tinkering with a good thing, so here are my additions to the Paradox rules. Mostly, they are suggestions for quickly resolving which of the various types of Paradox strike a mage.

Paradox Backlash occurs when the mage gains at least six points of Paradox at one time or the mage accumulates 11 or more points of Paradox total. Determine the strength of the backlash by rolling the character's Paradox Pool (equal to his total number of Paradox points, including those newly acquired) against difficulty 6. Each success expels one point of Paradox from the mage's pattern and the total number of successes is the strength of the backlash.

Paradox Backlash will manifest in a physical, spiritual or mental form. The Storyteller can choose how the Backlash manifests or roll a die to determine this: 1-5 physical, 6-8 spiritual, 9-10 mental. Depending on the strength of the Backlash and how it manifests, the effects of the backlash may vary.

|Level|Physical|Spiritual|Mental|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|1-5|Flaws|Paradox Minion|Quiet|
|6-9|Damage|Paradox Preceptor|Quiet/Realm|
|10+|Explosion|Paradox Lord|Realm|


**Flaws —** Paradox causes physical alterations in a mage or the immediate area. The stronger the backlash, the more severe the alteration. For more details on Flaws, see below.

**Damage —** The mage receives one Health Level of Aggravated damage per point of strength of the Backlash. The mage may roll to soak this damage (using Stamina), but cannot heal it magickally. A backlash this severe can kill the offending mage, especially if she was already wounded.

**Explosion —** A massive explosion results, inflicting Health Levels of Aggravated damage equal to the strength of the Backlash, divided evenly amongst everyone within a few yards of the mage. As above, the victims may soak the damage but it cannot be healed magickally.

**Spirits —** A Paradox spirit appears and plagues the mage. The level of power of the spirit depends on the strength of the backlash, while the nature of the spirit depends on the Sphere of magick the mage was using. Paradox spirits are exceptionally resistant to magick. They may roll their Gnosis/Arete as countermagick automatically. Usually there is some way a mage can appease a Paradox spirit so that it will leave him be. The mage can also try and destroy the spirit using non-magickal means. Failing all else, most Paradox spirits will eventually get bored and wander off to harass some other mage.

**Quiet —** Quiet can be induced as a backlash. However, the strength of the Quiet does not depend on the strength of the backlash. Instead, it depends on the total points of Paradox the mage had immediately before the backlash. Quiet can be induced by other means, such as the overuse of perceptual magick or psychic trauma (Storyteller's option). Detailed descriptions of Quiet appear in the mage rules.

**Realms —** Truly horrendous backlashes can remove a mage from reality completely. Some mages view this as an advanced form of Quiet, in which the mage is physically locked in a hallucinatory Realm. Examples of different Paradox realms are again detailed in the rules.

#### Paradox Flaws

The most common backlash is a Paradox Flaw of some sort. There are two schools of thought about the nature of Paradox Flaws. The loose school feels that a Paradox Flaw can be anything, a manifestation of wild magick. The hard school believes that Paradox should not make reality stranger and that Flaws should manifest in a "coincidental" way. According to the second school, Paradox should make problems for a mage, but in a way that could be accepted as reasonably normal by a Sleeper. Personally, I tend to flip-flop between the two schools, depending on my mood and the circumstances. The more Sleepers that are around, the less likely it is that Paradox will be vulgar.

Note that Paradox need not show up right away. Just because a mage suffered a backlash doesn't mean you have to hit him with it immediately. You can hold it off for a bit and then hit the mage with the Paradox when he is in a sticky situation. Alternately, if a mage suffers a major backlash during an important juncture, where it might disrupt the flow of the story, put it off until later. You can even put off Paradox just to make your players sweat a bit and give yourself time to think of something really clever. In general you shouldn't put Paradox between sessions. It becomes to much of a temptation to forget it completely.

Under the new rules, the player no longer has any control over how a Paradox Flaw manifests. It is all in the hands of the Storyteller. If you have a good set of roleplayers, though, there is nothing to stop you from soliciting suggestions from a player. Better yet, solicit suggestions from the _other_ players. Peers can be so cruel. You can even take those suggestions and add nasty little twists of your own.

The simplest sort of Paradox Flaw is to make the punishment fit the crime. Take whatever magick the mage was working and twist it in some unpleasant way. You can reverse the magick, making it have the opposite effect or rebound it onto the mage (or one of his companions). You can have the magick manifest in strange ways, through a "coincidence gone bad". For example, if a mage is trying to use magick to open a door while sneaking into a building, the coincidence might be the hinges are weak and the entire door falls out of its frame with a loud bang, attracting the attention of the guards. You can also use Sphere effects for ideas for Paradox Flaws. Simply take one of the effects for the Sphere, of the appropriate rating, and inflict it on the hapless mage.

The severity of the flaw depends on the exact strength of the backlash. Flaws can be broken into five different levels. Level 1 Flaws are minor annoyances that last only a few seconds (rare, under these rules). Level 2 Flaws hinder the mage in some slight way and usually last for a while (hours). Level 3 Flaws cause serious problems and also last for a decent period of time (hours or days). The mage can even be slightly injured by such flaws (1 or 2 Health Levels). Level 4 Flaws can be crippling, possibly causing serious harm (3 or 4 Health Levels) forcing the mage to retreat and recuperate. Level 5 Flaws can incapacitate a mage, rendering her completely helpless and keep her that way for days or weeks. This level of flaw can seriously injure a mage (5 or 6 Health Levels), but will never kill her outright.

Paradox can also permanently alter a mage. A Level 3 or 4 Flaw can manifest as a permanent flaw of a minor, annoying sort (equal to Level 1). A Level 5 Flaw can manifest as a permanent flaw of a serious nature (equal to a Level 2 Flaw). If a mage gets hit with serious Paradox during an important part of your story, you may wish to stick them with a weaker but permanent Flaw so that they can continue on.

Below are a list of possible Paradox Flaws, organized by Sphere and level. Some of them are coincidental and others are not. Note that the duration of a Flaw can also affect its severity. A Level 2 backlash could manifest as a level 1 Flaw that lasts for days, or a level 3 Flaw that only lasts for a minute or two. The standard duration for a Flaw is a few hours. This can be lengthened to days or shortened to minutes. Level 4 and 5 Flaws last longer. The standard duration is day, which can be shortened to hours, or lengthened to weeks.

#### Correspondence

**Level 1:** The mage can only see behind himself for a few moments.

**Level 2:** The mage's perception of space is altered for a few hours (objects in this mirror may appear to be closer than they actually are). The mage can still function, but may suffer +1 or +2 to his difficulty rolls for things that depend on his senses.

**Level 3:** Objects in the mage's possession gravitate to his left. His watch appears on his left hand, his wallet in his left pocket, etc. More significantly, any effect he casts will manifest several yards to the left of where he targeted it.

**Level 4:** The mage finds that he no longer can control direction. Anything he does will be targeted in a random direction. A spell he casts will have a randomly determined target and he will walk in a strange sort of Brownian motion, with no control over his destination. The mage must be guided from one place to another.

**Level 5:** The mage's body is turned inside out, flesh on the inside, organs on the outside, yet she mysteriously stays alive. This state is incredibly painful and the mage can do nothing but writhe in agony until the effect passes.

#### Entropy

**Level 1:** The next feat the mage attempts fails automatically (don't bother to roll).

**Level 2:** Everything the mage sees is tinged with decay, not unlike the vision of wraiths. In addition to being rather depressing, it makes it difficult for mages to judge the mood of people and he has +2 to his difficulty for rolls like Empathy, Intimidation, Leader, etc.

**Level 3:** The mage finds that material objects become rotten and brittle under his touch. His equipment may break or he may fall through holes in the floor.

**Level 4:** People in the vicinity of the mage will feel ill and out of sorts. Others will suffer a +1 penalty to the difficulty of any roll they have to make. The effect never seems to extend to the mage's enemies.

**Level 5:** The mage finds himself aging rapidly, at a rate of one year per minute. This continues for hours, yet the mage will not die, becoming a withered husk instead at about the age of 150 or so. The mage then returns slowly to normal, at a rate of 1 year per hour.

#### Forces

**Level 1:** The mage's hair stands on end, as if he were subject to static electricity. It goes away after a minute or two.

**Level 2:** The mage's perception of the world changes, so that he sees everything in black and white.

**Level 3:** For the next few hours, electrical devices fail to function within about 5 yards of the mage.

**Level 4:** The mage finds herself floating one inch off the floor. This makes it very difficult to get anywhere, since the mage must pull herself along the walls and furniture.

**Level 5:** The mage is struck completely blind and deaf. Other forms of perceptual magick are ineffective as well. This can last for days.

#### Life

**Level 1:** The mage suffers from a sudden, violent muscle spasm, throwing her off balance.

**Level 2:** The mage catches a nasty head cold. Between sneezing, watery eyes and headaches, the mage is at +1 difficulty to most rolls.

**Level 3:** The mage finds that nearby plants grow at an alarming rate, especially if he is in direct contact with the plant.

**Level 4:** One of the mage's limbs ceases to function.

**Level 5:** The mage suffers from a violent epileptic seizure that lasts for hours. It will take him days to recuperate.

#### Matter

**Level 1:** Whatever surface the mage is standing on becomes briefly slippery, causing him to fall.

**Level 2:** One important piece of equipment (perhaps a focus) breaks.

**Level 3:** The mage finds himself unable to physically interact with some common substance (metal, wood, etc.). The material passes right through him. This can be quite embarrassing if the substance is clothing.

**Level 4:** Any water the mage touches will freeze (large bodies of water only freeze within about a foot of the mage).

**Level 5:** The mage's body crystallizes. He can only move at a rate of one inch per minute, and magick becomes impossible.

#### Mind

**Level 1:** For the next few minutes, the mage speaks _exactly_ what is on her mind, broadcasting her thoughts.

**Level 2:** The mage receives a lot of psychic static, random impressions from the minds of those around her. There is too much "noise" for the mage to learn anything useful and the effect is rather distracting.

**Level 3:** The mage finds that he has become a mental chameleon. He involuntarily adopts the mannerisms and personality of anyone with whom he spends more than a minute.

**Level 4:** The mage adopts some form of clinical insanity, such as a severe phobia of some nearby object or paranoid delusions.

**Level 5:** The mage's mental processes become completely jumbled and he finds it impossible to form any coherent thought.

#### Prime

**Level 1:** The mage briefly pulses with magickal energy so that his presence is easily perceived by any magickally aware being.

**Level 2:** One of the rotes the mage is currently maintaining ceases to function.

**Level 3:** All the Quintessence in a mage's pattern bleeds away.

**Level 4:** The mage becomes a "magick magnet" and any effect cast in her vicinity will target the mage in addition to its normal target.

**Level 5:** The mage looses touch with her Avatar and is unable to perform any sort of magick for days (or weeks).

#### Spirit

Most Spirit paradoxes result in the manifestation of a Paradox spirit, or the spirit magick the mage is currently working goes horribly wrong. Other possibilities include having the mage shunt involuntarily into the Umbra, attracting malignant (non-Paradox) spirits or becoming a spirit herself for a period of time.

#### Time

**Level 1:** All the timepieces in the mage's area stop.

**Level 2:** The mage's perception of time becomes disjointed so that he sees everything one second in the future. He starts to answer questions before people have finished speaking. Alternately, the mage sees things one second in the past. It becomes more difficult to target people in the present (+1 or +2 to difficulty).

**Level 3:** The mage suffers from time dilation and can only act half as often as everyone else. Magick cannot counter this effect.

**Level 4:** The mage loses his short term memory. He can only remember things that happened more than five minutes ago. He must act based only on his immediate perceptions.

**Level 5:** The mage vanishes, only to reappear in the future, at some time of the Storyteller's choosing (though not more than a month or two later).

#### Paradox Rotes

Mages with a greater knowledge of Prime are able to control the Paradox in their pattern to a fine degree with the following rotes.

Induce Backlash (Prime 2)

Many mages choose not to wait for Paradox to strike and deliberately induce a Paradox backlash on themselves, preferably while they are somewhere safe, like their sanctum. The strength of the backlash is still rolled randomly. No matter what the circumstances, this Rote always counts as vulgar, even in the Umbra or in a mage's Sanctum. Thus, the rote always adds at least one point of Paradox to the mage's total pool. Heaven help the mage that botches this effect.

Controlled Backlash (Prime 4 or Prime 2, Entropy 2)

A more advanced version of the above rote, the mage has a greater degree of control over how much Paradox energy is released. For each success beyond the first, the mage can increase or decrease the strength of the backlash by one point. However, the mage still has no control over exactly how the Paradox manifests. This rote is also always vulgar.
