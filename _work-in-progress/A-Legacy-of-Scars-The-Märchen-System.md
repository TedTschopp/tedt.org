# Legacy of Scars (A Genre-Neutral Solution for Enemies, Nemesis, )





## Introduction

**Legacy of Scars Overview:** This supplement introduces dynamic foes who evolve, remember past encounters, and seek revenge. The rules are **genre-neutral** – whether you’re running fantasy, sci-fi, horror, western, or spy adventures, these guidelines adapt to any world with magic or technology. The goal is to keep mechanics **intuitive and light**, focusing on story and improvisation over crunch. GMs (Judges) and players will find tools here to create memorable recurring villains (and even allies) with minimal overhead.

**Core Features:** The Legacy of Scars gives any run-of-the-mill enemy a shot at *“super-villain”* status. A lowly goblin, space pirate, or mobster who survives or bests the heroes can rise through a simple **hierarchy of 8 tiers (-4 to +4)**, gaining personality, scars, and perhaps new abilities along the way. These nemeses remember the PCs’ actions and adapt to them, creating personal storylines of rivalry and vengeance. Both NPCs and player characters can participate – while typically used for adversaries, the framework can also track strong allies or even a PC’s infamy within an enemy faction. All of this is achieved with a few easy rules, clear narrative cues, and minimal bookkeeping.

### Example: “Goblin Grix becomes a Legend”

| Session | Fictional Event                                           | Rank                               | New Trait/Title                                | Notes                                   |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Grix the goblin archer crits a PC, then flees.            | 0 → **+1** (Survived vs PCs)       | *“Grix Sharp‑Eye”* (One‑Eyed? no—he’s proud)   | Gains +1 morale to goblin squad.        |
| 3       | PCs storm the goblin lair; Grix loses an eye but escapes. | stays **+1** (defeat but survived) | **One‑Eyed** (–1 ranged, +1 intimidate)        | Title now *“Grix One‑Eye”.*             |

Notice: *one rank change at a time, a single clear trait each shift, minimal math.*

###  Mechanical Integration

Use **one** of these two defaults:

1. **Rank Modifier Rule** *(recommended)* – already in the Quick Reference.
2. **Dice‑Chain Variant** – each rank step up shifts one die up (d20→d24→d30) for reputation or command checks only. Use in DCC‑flavoured games.

Avoid stacking large raw bonuses on combat stats; make nemeses interesting through **tactics, terrain, and minions**.

### Balancing Nemesis Encounters

* **Add brains before numbers.** Give returning foes knowledge of PCs’ tactics first; buff stats second.
* **Cap direct bonuses at +2 total** unless the nemesis just ranked up.
* **Trade HP for environment.** A +3 lich in a neutral room is dull; a +3 lich in its necrotic sanctum with empowered traps is memorable.
* **Exit ramps:** Design one credible escape route and one credible way for PCs to finish the job, every time.

### Player Engagement & Reputation

Tell the table, in character, when their deeds alter a nemesis’s station: “The bards now sing of how you humbled *Grix One‑Eye;* goblins tremble at your name.”
Encourage players to:

* Exploit nemesis fears and scars.
* Spread rumours (downgrade enemy morale).
* Court powerful allies (earn negative ranks).
* Decide whether to **spare** or **pursue** a fleeing enemy—choices fuel the ladder.

## Running the System in Play

1. **Flag candidates** the moment an NPC survives or shines.
2. **Log four fields only:** Name, Rank, Latest Trait/Title, Last Scene Note.
3. **Review between sessions**; apply one trigger if it clearly fired.
4. **Introduce or foreshadow** a nemesis in 1 of every 3 sessions for suspense.
5. When a nemesis reaches +4 or –4, prepare a **campaign‑level climax**—or hand the mantle to their heir on death.

















## The Nemesis Hierarchy (Tiered Levels -4 to +4)

At the heart of the system is a **tiered hierarchy** representing a character’s importance or relationship in the campaign. There are 8 ranked levels, from **-4 up to +4**, with **0 as a neutral state**. A rank of 0 means the character is just another face in the crowd – no special enmity or loyalty. Positive ranks (+1 to +4) indicate an increasingly formidable enemy (a true *nemesis*), while negative ranks (-1 to -4) can optionally represent an ally or friendly rival of similar significance.

**Hierarchy Tiers:** Use the table below to visualize the hierarchy in generic terms. (Feel free to reskin titles to fit your genre – e.g. a +4 could be an evil warlord, a crime boss, a starship admiral, etc.) Higher ranks generally mean greater power, notoriety, and resources, while lower (negative) ranks mean a closer ally or subordinate.

| Tier (Rating) | Nemesis Status        | Description (Enemy Perspective / Ally Perspective)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------:|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        **+4** | **Arch-Nemesis**      | The ultimate foe – a supreme villain (dark overlord, kingpin, alien queen) at the top of their power. Commands legions or vast resources. Personal vendetta with the heroes is at maximum intensity. (Ally perspective: **Patron/Mentor** – a most trusted, powerful benefactor on the PCs’ side.)                                    |
|        **+3** | **Nemesis Champion**  | A second-in-command or infamous lieutenant. Nearly on top; formidable in combat and influence. Likely holds a title of fear (e.g. war-chief, crime boss lieutenant). Might aspire to dethrone the +4. (Ally: **Champion** – staunch allied hero or faction leader supporting the PCs.)                                                |
|        **+2** | **Major Nemesis**     | A notable enemy leader or elite foe. Has earned a reputation through deeds (perhaps a captain of the guard, a gang leader, a vampire lord’s chosen). Often has minions and a couple of notable strengths *and* a weakness. (Ally: **Trusted Ally** – important friend, maybe a titled companion or minor lord supportive of the PCs.) |
|        **+1** | **Minor Nemesis**     | A minor boss or recurring antagonist. Possibly an upstart officer, a local sorcerer, or a henchman who has survived clashes. Notorious enough to have a name and some unique trait, but still growing. (Ally: **Ally/Rival** – a friendly rival or helpful NPC with personal ties to the party.)                                      |
|         **0** | **Neutral**           | No special status. A typical character, neither nemesis nor ally. Most NPCs and faceless foes start here. (Can also represent an ex-nemesis who’s been neutralized or a former ally now at arm’s length.)                                                                                                                             |
|        **-1** | **Minor Ally**        | A minor friendly NPC who consistently aids the party (e.g. a helpful guide, an informant). Not an enemy at all, but tracked if needed for relationship shifts.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|        **-2** | **Notable Ally**      | A noteworthy ally or subordinate under the PCs’ influence (e.g. a squire, a partner in crime, a squadmate). They might have a personal bond equivalent to a nemesis’ hatred, but as loyalty.                                                                                                                                          |
|        **-3** | **Ally Champion**     | A major allied figure (local lord who favors the party, the captain of the city watch who is the party’s friend, etc.). They have considerable influence they can wield on the party’s behalf.                                                                                                                                        |
|        **-4** | **Pillar of Support** | A devoted patron, mentor, or companion whose fate is tightly bound to the PCs. They might lead a faction allied to the heroes or be a beloved mentor. (If corrupted or betrayed, someone of this significance could *become* an arch-nemesis!)                                                                                        |

**Using the Scale:** Most of the time, you will use positive ranks for **enemies**. It’s perfectly fine to ignore the negative side if you only want a nemesis-villain system. However, the negative ranks are available to mirror these rules for allies or to model a flip in allegiance. For example, a defeated foe might later *join* the heroes, moving from +2 enemy to -2 ally. Likewise, a betrayed ally could shift into the positive (enemy) side. A character’s rank can thus rise and fall through play, reflecting their evolving role.

**Mechanical Impact:** Nemesis rank is mainly a narrative tool, but it can have light mechanical effects:

* **Notoriety & Morale:** NPCs might react to high-rank characters with fear or respect. For instance, rank +3 or +4 villains could cause hirelings to check morale or impose a -1 or -2 penalty on PCs’ NPC allies due to intimidation. Conversely, a rank -4 ally (famous hero on the PCs’ side) might *boost* the party’s morale when present.
* **Resource Modifier:** You can treat the rank number as a rough indicator of how many resources or minions a character can command. E.g., a +2 Major Nemesis might have two squads of minions, whereas a +4 Arch-Nemesis has an army. In gaming terms, a higher-ranked foe could also have a higher Hit Die or better equipment (but avoid overt +X arms race; focus on narrative resources).
* **Dice Chain Shifts (Optional):** For a DCC-flavored twist, consider using the rank as a step on the dice chain for certain checks (e.g., an influence or reputation check). A +4 might roll a d30 where a +1 would roll a d20, to reflect greater influence. This is strictly optional and only if you want a bit of mechanical differentiation; the system works with pure description as well.

## Evolving Enemies with Memory & Revenge

A key feature of the Legacy of Scars is that **enemies remember past encounters** and **change because of them**. Rather than treating each fight as a one-off, note which foes survive (or even temporarily defeat the PCs). These recurring enemies will *evolve* – gaining scars, tricks, grudges, and maybe promotions in their own ranks.

**Memory of Conflict:** A nemesis will recall how the last battle went. They will often reference it in-game (taunting or snarling things like “*Remember when you left me in the burning barn?*”). More importantly, they **adapt their tactics**:

* If the heroes exploited a particular weakness or tactic, the nemesis learns from it. For example, if a cultist captain fled after the wizard blasted him with fire, he might return wearing charred but fire-resistant robes or with a newfound **fear of fire** that drives him to avoid it. A cyborg gangster who barely survived a sniper shot to the eye might get a metal eye-patch implant and deploy smoke grenades to thwart sharpshooters next time.
* Nemesis characters **carry injuries forward**. A foe scarred or maimed in a fight will bear visible marks (scars, burns, missing limbs) in later appearances. These are not just cosmetic – they inform personality and mechanics. A nemesis who lost an arm might have a crude mechanical replacement or fight one-handed with surprising ferocity. A villain *“burned and left for dead”* could return as *Karzog the Burned*, now immune or resistant to fire (or conversely, *terrified* of fire, depending on what fits the story).
* **Growth and Adaptation:** Conversely, if the nemesis **won** the last encounter (especially if they felled a PC), they gain confidence and possibly new abilities. They might taunt the party about the kill and use the fallen PC’s weapon as a trophy. For example, an outlaw gunslinger who shot down the party’s best duelist may now wear the duelist’s hat and have improved accuracy (reflected narratively or via a +1 to attack). In fantasy, that orc who bested the warrior might have claimed the warrior’s magic sword, making the orc deadlier in melee.

**Seeking Revenge:** Nemesis enemies don’t forget grudges. If the PCs seriously wounded or foiled them, they *actively seek payback*. This doesn’t mean every defeated goblin comes chasing the party, but significant foes should resurface at dramatic moments:

* **Timed Revenge:** A nemesis might ambush the party when they’re vulnerable or interrupt a later quest at the worst time (“*We meet again!*”). Use sparingly for surprise, or telegraph their return with signs (e.g. the party hears a rumor that the one-bandit-with-the-scar is terrorizing another village, looking for them).
* **Escalating Threat:** Each time a nemesis returns, consider them a bit stronger or craftier (within reason). Narratively explain their growth: *“Since our last duel, I have studied your moves…”*. In mechanics, you might give a returning nemesis a small boost: +1 HD, a new special ability or resistance, or additional minions at their side. This follows the video game’s logic where surviving nemeses lose weaknesses and gain strengths as they rise in power, but in tabletop keep it subtle to avoid overwhelming the players.
* **Persistence (Cheating Death):** It’s perfectly fine to *let a nemesis escape death* if it serves the story, but keep it plausible. If an enemy was not explicitly killed (no body recovered, fell off a cliff, etc.), that’s an opening for survival. Even if “killed”, dark magic, advanced tech, or sheer toughness could bring them back **once** – preferably with a vivid explanation (e.g. “I made a pact in hell to hunt you!” or “They stitched me back together in a secret lab.”). However, **don’t overuse** this; if every foe returns, players will grow frustrated and start decapitating everything. Make sure truly killing a nemesis is possible (a decisive final death) if the PCs go the extra mile. *Tip:* Encourage nemesis survival by having them *flee* when a battle turns against them, or have minions drag them to safety if defeated, rather than relying on resurrection gimmicks. This way players can still choose to chase and finish an enemy, or let them go and see them later.

## Promotions & Demotions in Rank

Nemesis characters exist in a world of their own motives and pecking order. When fortunes change in the campaign, **adjust their rank** accordingly to keep the hierarchy dynamic.

**Promotion (Rank Up):** NPCs can rise in rank through notable victories and circumstances:

* **Killing a Notable Character:** If a low-ranked enemy actually slays a player character or an important NPC ally, they *immediately gain a promotion*. A random orc that lands the killing blow on a hero might go from faceless **0** to a named **+1 Nemesis** on the spot. The news of the kill spreads in the world (or within the enemy faction), and the once-nameless foe earns a title. *“Grimble, Eater of Earwax”* became a captain after killing the player in – in your game, that could be “Grimble Spellbreaker” after he fells a PC wizard. This promotion grants the NPC new status: perhaps command of a squad or a better weapon looted from the fallen foe.
* **Surviving an Encounter with PCs:** If an NPC underling survives a battle against the odds (especially if they were wounded but escaped), consider a promotion. The logic is that within their group, surviving a fight with the infamous heroes is a feat. For example, a thug who flees and lives to tell the tale might be *“the one who faced the Outlaws and lived”*, gaining respect among his peers. Mechanically, bump a 0 to +1, or +1 to +2, etc. They might fill a power vacuum left by other defeated foes. (In the source material, *any* grunt who accomplishes great feats like defeating a captain or the hero could become a Captain themselves.)
* **Vacancy and Ambition:** If the party takes down a higher-ranked villain, one of the surviving lower-ranked nemeses may *step up to replace them*. Say the heroes killed a +3 Nemesis Champion; pick a +2 or +1 who survived somewhere and bump them up to +3 to reflect that they seized the opportunity. Perhaps even a nobody (0) claims credit for the deed and is thrust upward. This keeps the ladder filled and maintains pressure on the PCs (“cut off one head, another rises”). It’s also a great way to escalate a formerly minor foe – the pesky bandit the party spared might now proclaim himself the new gang leader.
* **Personal Growth:** Sometimes promotion isn’t about faction rank but personal improvement. A nemesis might train, find a magic artifact, or otherwise improve between appearances. In game terms, you might promote them if they’ve appeared several times and you want to signal they’ve become more dangerous. Give a story reason (e.g. the cultist studied forbidden tomes since last time, raising him to a +2 Major Nemesis with new spells).

**Demotion (Rank Down):** On the flip side, nemeses can fall in standing due to failures or humiliation:

* **Defeat without Death:** If a nemesis is beaten by the PCs but survives (captured and escapes, or flees in shame), their superiors or underlings may view them as weak. Consider dropping their rank by 1. For instance, the evil knight who was routed might lose favor with his dark lord – going from +3 to +2. Narratively, you might depict them in a worse state next time (fewer minions, shoddy gear). They could be obsessed with restoring their honor.
* **Public Humiliation:** If the defeat was dramatic (say the PCs spared the villain’s life publicly or spread word of their failure), a nemesis could be *stripped of title*. Perhaps an orc war-chief demotes a Captain who failed to kill the PCs. This NPC might remain in play as a wild card: now a rogue element without authority, or even turning to the PCs’ side out of spite. Mechanically, you might move them from +2 down to +1 or even 0 (neutral) if they’re truly outcast.
* **Infighting Loss:** Nemesis factions are full of rivalry and backstabbing. If you determine that two NPC foes clashed and one lost (see **Rivalries** below), the loser might be demoted. They may have escaped death, but their defeat by a rival knocks them down a peg. Use this sparingly unless the players set it in motion (e.g. by sowing discord). It can be interesting for the party to encounter a former big bad who’s now fallen on hard times thanks to another villain.

When adjusting ranks, **update the character’s stats and influence accordingly** (perhaps they lose or gain henchmen, resources, or minor stat boosts as appropriate). But avoid seesawing ranks too frequently – focus on major story beats for changes. A nemesis who bounces up and down every session loses credibility; ideally, promotions/demotions come from notable events the players are aware of or responsible for.

## Rivalries and Power Struggles

Nemeses don’t exist in a vacuum; they often have **relationships with each other**. This can lead to intriguing scenarios where the heroes are not the only threat on a villain’s mind. Incorporating rivalries adds depth and opportunities for the PCs to exploit.

* **Enemy vs. Enemy:** Within the enemy hierarchy, ambitious individuals will scheme and duel for higher position. *Orc society is built on backstabbing and in-fighting in the source material,* and you can reflect that in your game. Two captains might challenge each other for a Warlord’s favor, or a gang lieutenant might attempt a coup against the boss. If such a power struggle occurs, decide (or roll) who wins – the victor likely earns a promotion, and the loser might be dead or demoted. The players could learn of an upcoming duel or trial-by-combat and even choose to let it play out (weakening the villains) or interfere to pick who comes out on top.
* **Personal Rivalries:** Some nemeses might develop almost as dark mirrors to the PCs *or to each other*. For example, two nemesis assassins might compete to be the one to kill a particular PC (each wanting the glory). Or a nemesis may have a **blood-brother** or sibling in the same faction; if one is killed, the other seeks vengeance. The heroes might kill a cult leader, only to later face his vengeful apprentice who was *also* a nemesis in the making. In mechanical terms, a “blood-brother” revenge could instantly bump that character’s motivation or even rank (“Fueled by rage, he’s now a +3 Major Nemesis bent on avenging his brother’s death”).
* **Alliances and Betrayals:** Rivalries aren’t always kill-on-sight; sometimes two nemesis NPCs will form an alliance (at least temporarily). They might join forces against the PCs if it’s mutually beneficial. Conversely, a strong rivalry can be exploited by the party: use diplomacy or trickery to pit villains against each other. If the heroes deliberately orchestrate a betrayal (say convincing a tyrant’s bodyguard to turn on him), you can resolve it through the nemesis rules (the bodyguard might slay the tyrant, taking his place as the new +4 Arch-Nemesis – different face, same threat level!). Always consider the **genre**: in a spy game, rival double-agents may sabotage each other’s plots; in a fantasy game, two dragon nemeses might fight over territory.
* **Player Characters as Rivals:** If using the ally side of the Nemesis scale, PC-allied NPCs can also have rivalries. Perhaps the party’s two closest allies (rank -2 each) have a feud, forcing the PCs to navigate their conflict. This can be roleplayed out rather than mechanized, but the hierarchy can inform who outranks whom in influence. Ultimately, use rivalries to enrich the story – it’s an additional layer that makes the world feel alive, where NPCs have agendas beyond just reacting to the heroes.

## Scars and Titles (Marks of a Nemesis)

One of the most flavorful aspects of a nemesis is the **baggage they carry from past interactions**. This system encourages giving recurring characters **distinctive scars, titles, or traits** reflecting their history. Not only does this add personality, it also serves as a reminder to players of *“oh, it’s THAT guy – the one-eyed bandit we left for dead!”*

**Titles:** Upon achieving nemesis status (or on a rank change), consider bestowing a short epithet or nickname. You can create titles based on what happened in play:

* **Injury-Based Titles:** If the PC slashed an enemy’s face but they survived, that NPC might return as **“Skarlok the Scarred”** or **“One-Eyed Skarlok.”** A foe blown up in an explosion might be **“Burned Mulciber”**. These titles remind everyone how they got that way. They can be purely descriptive or hint at new abilities (e.g. “Burned” might come with fire resistance or a fear of fire – either can make sense).
* **Victory Titles:** If a nemesis earned a big win, give them a boastful name. The mercenary who killed a PC named Raven could style himself **“Ravenbane”**. An alien intelligence that thwarted the party’s plans might call itself **“Overmind Ascendant”** now. These titles stroke the NPC’s ego and make them stand out in rumors.
* **Behavioral Titles:** Sometimes a quirk or tactic yields a title: an NPC who ran away might be mockingly dubbed **“the Coward.”** One who always brings a horde of minions might be **“Hargul the Summoner.”** Try to tie it to how the players experienced them (if they noticed the necromancer kept reviving zombies, a fitting title could be **“Gravesinger”** or **“the Corpse-Master”**).
* **Faction or Cultural Titles:** In certain genres, titles may be bestowed by the enemy faction itself. A pirate nemesis might earn the moniker **“Dread Captain”** after a promotion. A noble who turns against the party might be called **“Lord Betrayer.”** Think of these as achievements recognized in-world.

Encourage players to *use* these titles when talking about the foe – it increases the nemesis’s legend. As Judge, you can have bards or news broadsheets mention *“the notorious highwayman Blackblade has struck again”* – reinforcing that Blackblade = that bandit leader who escaped the PCs twice.

**Scars & Marks:** Visually and mechanically, mark nemeses with the scars of battle:

* **Physical Scars:** Detail what lasting injuries they have. “Jagged scar across face, cloudy blind left eye” is instantly evocative. It helps players recall, *this is the orc I nearly decapitated.* More than flavor, these can influence the game: a one-eyed enemy might have a penalty on depth perception (maybe a slight ranged attack penalty), but perhaps gains a bonus to intimidation because it makes them look fierce. Keep such modifiers small (+/-1 or so) if you use them, or handle it via roleplay (one eye might mean the NPC doesn’t spot a sneaking PC on his blind side, etc.).
* **Prosthetics & Augmentations:** In a sci-fi or steampunk setting, scars might be accompanied by cybernetics or prosthetic replacements. A nemesis who lost an arm to the PCs could return with a robotic limb (and maybe a *new* attack with it). A fantasy lich who was “killed” may now have half his skeletal face inlaid with an iron mask. These changes signal advancement.
* **Mental Scars (Fears and Hatreds):** Not all wounds are visible. An enemy who survived a traumatic defeat might develop a specific fear or obsession. Perhaps the cult leader, once burned, now *hates* fire to the point of frenzy – he might panic or fly into rage when fire is used. The warlord who was humiliated in duel might hold a singular hatred for the party’s fighter; any time that PC is present, the warlord focuses all efforts on them (even to his detriment). These mental scars can be roleplayed, or given a simple rule (e.g. “if confronted with the source of fear, the nemesis must make a Will save or retreat; if confronting their hated foe, they fight with +2 to attacks but ignore others”).

**Quick Nemesis Traits Table:** When a nemesis survives a notable incident, you can pick or roll a trait from the examples below to reflect their scar or evolution:

| d6 | New Trait (Scars & Quirks)                                       | Description/Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:--:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Burn Scarred** – Charred skin, fear of fire.                   | Marked by flame (half face burned or similar). **Effect:** Resistant to fire damage or utterly afraid of it – decides based on character (e.g. a demon might become immune to fire; a man might become pyrophobic). In either case, fire defined their last defeat.                                                                                               |
| 2  | **Maimed Limb** – Lost hand/arm (or other part).                 | They bear a stump or mechanical prosthetic. **Effect:** May have a new weapon in that limb (hook, sword-arm, cybernetic tool). Possibly suffers a penalty in some situations (e.g. can’t use two-handed weapons well) but gained a signature attack with the prosthetic.                                                                                          |
| 3  | **One-Eyed (or Eye Patch)** – Lost an eye.                       | Wears an eye patch or has a milky white eye. **Effect:** -1 to ranged attack rolls or perception requiring depth, but +1 to intimidation (looks fearsome) and a personal vendetta against whoever took the eye. Often gets the title “One-Eyed” or “the Cyclops” etc.                                                                                             |
| 4  | **Vengeful Hatred** – Sworn revenge, fights harder when wounded. | After being beaten, their driving purpose is revenge. **Effect:** If facing the PC(s) who scarred or defeated them, they gain a surge of fury (e.g. once per fight, trigger a rage that grants +2 to attack or temporary HP when they drop below half health – mimicking “hate triggers” like in the video game where some nemeses enraged when near defeat).     |
| 5  | **Upgraded Gear** – New weapon, armor, or gadget.                | They acquired a better kit after last time (maybe even the PC’s gear!). **Effect:** Improved offense or defense – could be +2 AC armor or a weapon that deals an extra damage die, etc. The item could have a thematic tie (silver sword if PCs are werewolves, high-tech scanner to spot the sneaky hacker PC, etc.). Reflects learning from previous encounter. |
| 6  | **Allies or Bodyguard** – Never alone now.                       | Learned not to face the PCs solo. **Effect:** Always accompanied by a bodyguard or minions (of one rank lower, or just a couple extra mooks). In narrative, this might be because the nemesis gained rank or formed alliances. You might even designate a specific bodyguard who can become a minor nemesis if killed (à la *blood-brother* vengeance).           |

These are just examples – craft whatever fits the situation. The key is **consistency**: once you give a nemesis a scar/trait, carry it forward each time they appear. It’s both a badge of honor for them and a dynamic variable in encounters.

## Player Characters and the Legacy of Scars

Player characters are not excluded from its web of grudges and alliances. Here are ways PCs can interact with or even be part of the hierarchy:

* **PCs as Targets:** A high-ranked nemesis will *single out* certain PCs as their personal adversary. For example, the Arch-Nemesis (+4) might view the party’s warrior as his rival, or the cunning spy-villain might fixate on the party’s rogue. In game terms, this doesn’t change the PC’s stats, but narratively that PC is “marked.” The Judge can have the nemesis take actions specifically against that character – attacking their hometown, kidnapping their mentor, etc. It’s a good way to personalize the stakes.
* **PC Reputation (Nemesis Rank for PCs):** In some campaigns, especially open sandboxes, a **player character might gain a rank in the enemy’s eyes**. For instance, if the party constantly thwarts the cult of the Crimson Serpent, the cult might label the PCs as public enemies. The Judge could say, “Within the Crimson Serpent hierarchy, you are considered a +3 threat.” This is effectively the inverse – instead of how dangerous the nemesis is to the PCs, it’s how dangerous the PCs are perceived by the nemesis faction. Mechanically, you might have low-level cultists make morale checks when facing the famous “Dragonslayers” (because the PCs’ rep precedes them), or send progressively tougher assassins after them because only a high-ranked cult champion dares face them. It’s a narrative tool to gauge how the world reacts to the party’s successes.
* **PCs within Hierarchy:** In a twist, a player character might **join or infiltrate** an enemy organization. TTRPGS are generally flexible, and a campaign might have a PC who is a double agent or someone who seizes control of a faction. In this case, you can give that PC a nemesis rank *within that faction*. For example, a rogue PC goes undercover and becomes a captain among the thieves’ guild (equivalent to a +2 nemesis rank internally). They would then have to deal with rivals below and above as per the system. Promotions and demotions could apply if the PC does things to impress or anger their new “colleagues.” This can lead to PVP-like intrigue but should be handled collaboratively. It’s an advanced scenario but shows the system’s flexibility – players and NPCs alike can climb the same ladder.
* **Allies and Patrons:** Likewise, if using negative ranks for allies, a beloved PC patron (say the cleric’s temple mentor or a friendly king) could be tracked as a -3 or -4. This mostly just formalizes their importance. If that ally is ever compromised (corrupted or kidnapped by villains), the emotional impact is greater – they weren’t just some NPC, they were a Pillar of Support. Players can also intentionally cultivate relationships: e.g. “Let’s help Sir Gallant become the new Baron, he’s our friend (-2 Ally).” If they succeed, Sir Gallant might rise to -3 or -4, and in turn he has more power to aid the party (or more to lose, which enemies might exploit!).
* **Death and Legacy:** In TTRPGs, character death is common. If a PC dies, especially in a dramatic nemesis encounter, encourage the new PC (or surviving party) to carry on the feud. The fallen hero’s sword might be taken by the nemesis (as mentioned), and the new character might have a tie to the old (a sibling seeking revenge, an apprentice taking up the mantle). This keeps the nemesis storyline personal. From the nemesis perspective, *they* don’t care if Bob the warrior died – they now hate “those meddlers” as a group or transfer their ire to the next hero who stands out.

In all cases, **communication is key**. Let players know about these dynamics diegetically (through story, NPC chatter, etc.). The system should never override player agency – it’s there to enhance the narrative, not box PCs into a fate. If a player really doesn’t want their character to be the nemesis’s special target, spread the spotlight to another. Keep it fun for everyone involved.

## Using the System in TTRPG Play

Integrating the Legacy of Scars into a TTRPG campaign should feel natural – think of it as an *overlay* that adds continuity to your encounters and modules. Here are guidelines and tips for a smooth integration:

* **Start Small:** Introduce the concept gradually. In a funnel (0-level adventure), you might not use it at all – funnels are meat-grinders and it’s hard for 0-level peasants to have personal enemies. But keep an eye out for any surviving foe or rival from the funnel who could recur when the surviving PCs hit level 1. More likely, begin using nemesis tracking in early leveled adventures when an NPC opponent escapes or a particular villain makes an impression.

* **Identify Nemesis Candidates:** Not every monster or NPC needs this treatment. Pick a few that *stand out* – perhaps the antagonist of a module who got away, or even a henchman who rolled unusually well and caused the party grief. Those are your seeds. For example, if the party flees from **Zargoth the Reaver** in one session, that’s a great nemesis to develop. Mark him down at rank +1 or +2 depending on how infamous he was, note the outcome (he chased them off, or they wounded him in retreat), and apply the evolution rules next time he shows up.

* **Adventure Design:** When planning sessions, see if you can involve a nemesis organically. Some TTRPGS often have standalone dungeon crawls, but you can link them with a nemesis subplot. Perhaps while the PCs delve into a tomb, the nemesis is advancing their own agenda (stealing an artifact elsewhere). In a hex crawl or sandbox, you can have nemesis encounters be one of the random event types (“your camp is attacked at night by a familiar foe…”). In modules that include rival adventurers or recurring villains – those are perfect to enhance with this system.

* **Genre Adaptation Examples:**

  * *Fantasy:* A necromancer the party *thought* they killed crawls out of his grave with half a face (promotion to +2 with the title “the Deathless”). He starts haunting their steps, maybe animating their former fallen comrades as undead minions (personal and creepy!).
  * *Sci-Fi:* A space pirate captain jumps away after a lost starship battle. Next time, he’s got a new cybernetic arm and a bigger crew (rank +3 now), ambushing the players’ ship in an asteroid field. Use tech analogues for magic – maybe he’s encrypted his ship against the hacker PC’s favorite trick, etc.
  * *Horror:* A slasher the group could not destroy (because they ran or were knocked out) gains a near-mythic status. Townsfolk whisper about “the Hook-Handed Butcher” (- yes, give him a hook for the hand he lost to the PCs’ axe). Each confrontation, he’s a bit more relentless. The legacy of scars can emulate those horror villains who keep coming back, as long as the tone fits your game.
  * *Western:* The sheriff’s posse gunned down one outlaw, but *the outlaw’s brother* (there’s that blood-brother revenge again) takes over the gang (+2 now) and wears his sibling’s coat. He has a scar on his neck from the shootout and won’t show mercy this time. The hierarchy might be the structure of the gang or the lawmen – maybe the brother becomes the new gang leader, or if the PCs were outlaws, a vengeful marshal becomes their nemesis.
  * *Espionage:* A defeated enemy agent fakes their death and later resurfaces as a mole high in the agency (+3 Nemesis Champion in hierarchy). They remember how the PC foiled their previous plot, so now every scheme they run anticipates the PC’s tactics. The nemesis might even toy with the spy PC by leaving clues that *they* are behind the latest caper, making it personal.

* **Keep it Simple in Play:** During actual gameplay, you don’t need complex mechanics. The Legacy of Scars mostly operates between sessions or “off-camera” to inform how you set up the next scenes:

  * Use a notepad or spreadsheet to track current nemesis characters, their rank, one-line of their last interaction, and any trait/title. Update this after each session if something changed (promotion, scar, etc.).
  * When running an encounter with a nemesis, use their base creature stats or class as normal, just tweak for their personal traits (give that bonus or fear as needed, adjust hit points if they ranked up, etc.). You don’t need a fully new statblock every time – a few on-the-fly adjustments suffice.
  * Don’t overwhelm players by having *all* nemeses show up at once. It can be tempting to have a grand scene with three of the party’s nemeses each with their own agenda, but that can get chaotic. Better to spotlight them one at a time or in sensible pairs. For instance, two rival nemesis captains might both appear, but if so, consider letting their rivalry play out during the encounter (perhaps they argue or even come to blows, which the PCs can capitalize on).
  * Allow players creative solutions: If they decide to preemptively hunt down a nemesis before he gets stronger, that’s great – it might lead to a whole side quest (which you as Judge can flesh out, knowing this enemy’s habits and hideouts from prior notes). If they try to negotiate or flip a nemesis to an ally, use the roleplay and maybe a Personality check – it could shift that character to the negative side of the scale if successful.
  * **Luck & Mercy (DCC Specific):** DCC characters have the Luck mechanic, often to escape death or accomplish feats. Consider giving nemesis NPCs a *limited* form of Luck to mirror their survivability. For example, you might decide a notable nemesis can automatically escape a lethal blow once per campaign (like burning 7 NPC Luck points) – turning a killing stab into a mere scar as the villain tumbles off the cliff instead of dying. Use this sparingly and never to frustrate the players; it should serve the story (“Of course the Arch-Nemesis isn’t felled by the first lucky crit – he’ll be back with an eye patch!”). On the flip side, if players go the extra mile (burning Luck, making sure to destroy the body, etc.), reward that by **truly** ending the nemesis. The system shines in the back-and-forth, but a conclusively ended nemesis makes for a satisfying high point. They can always have a more dangerous protege waiting in the wings...
  * **Experience Points:** TTRPGs typically gives XP for defeating monsters or accomplishing goals. You might count a recurring nemesis only once for XP (to avoid farming the same foe), or give a small bonus each time they’re overcome since they tend to be tougher on reappearances. Alternatively, treat a multi-stage nemesis like one long challenge, awarding a lump sum once the nemesis arc is resolved permanently. Communicate with players if XP is handled differently to avoid confusion.

* **Avoiding Excess Crunch:** This system deliberately avoids heavy stat math – there’s no need for a detailed subsystem of points. If you ever feel the nemesis tracking is becoming too much paperwork or slowing the game, **simplify**. At minimum, all you truly need is: “Bad Guy X remembers what happened and either got bolder or is nursing wounds.” You can always improvise the rest. The tables and ranks are tools, not shackles. Use them to spark ideas and keep consistency, but don’t let them override a cool narrative twist you want to do.

* **Player Buy-in:** Make sure the players are on board with a recurring villains style game. Most will love it, as it turns hack-and-slash into a story of personal stakes. But if your group’s playstyle is to murder every opponent in sight, you might get fewer opportunities to invoke nemesis rules (since no one survives!). In such cases, consider having some nemesis characters not *physically* present in fights – e.g., the mastermind who always escapes, or the rival who competes with them indirectly – so the system still has fuel. Over time, players often come to enjoy that one orc who *always* runs away to fight another day.

* **Reward Creativity:** The best part of a Legacy of Scars in TTRPGs (unlike a video game) is the limitless creativity. Let the players scheme too. If they decide to **intimidate** low-level enemies by talking about how they beat “Gork the Flame-Bringer” last time, maybe give those mooks a morale penalty or even have them flee (“You fought *Flame-Bringer* and lived?! No way, we’re out of here!”). The PCs can leverage nemesis reputations to their advantage. Likewise, if they suffer a defeat, they might go on a specific quest to counter the nemesis’s new strength (“We need frost weapons, since the pyro-demon survived our last fight and will be immune to fire now!”). This adds a strategic layer to the campaign.

By weaving this Legacy of Scars into your game, you encourage *emergent storylines*: grudges that span adventures, villains who grow alongside the heroes, and a living world that reacts to the PCs’ deeds. It’s surprisingly easy to manage, as long as you update a few notes each session. The payoff is huge in player engagement – nothing fires up a table more than hearing *“that guy again!? Not this time – let’s finish him!”* or even *“I can’t believe it… he’s *back**.

With clear communication and a focus on fun, the Legacy of Scars will enhance your campaigns with memorable rivals destined to clash with your characters until destiny (or a well-placed sword) finally ends the feud. Happy hunting, and watch your back – your Nemesis is out there, watching and waiting…
