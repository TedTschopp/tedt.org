## Software approaches (executive-friendly)

### 1) Core enterprise suites and transaction systems

Large, integrated systems that run foundational operations and hold trusted
operational records.

* **Examples:** ERP, core banking/claims, HR/payroll suites, enterprise CRM,
  mainframe transaction systems
* **Typical traits:** shared data, strong governance, many modules, heavy
  integration, long-lived
* **Primary purpose:** run the business and maintain authoritative operational
  truth

**One‑liner test:** *If it’s the official system used to run core processes and
keep the “book of record,” it belongs here.*



### 2) Productivity and collaboration artifacts

Office-style tools used as “digital paper” to communicate, coordinate, capture,
and track—without becoming an application.

* **Examples:** documents, slide decks, shared folders, Teams/Slack spaces,
  wikis, simple intake forms, checklists, basic trackers in spreadsheets (no
  automation)
* **Typical traits:** fast to create, easy to share, team-owned, lightweight
  controls, risk increases when relied on operationally
* **Primary purpose:** support collaboration, documentation, and lightweight
  tracking

**One‑liner test:** *If it’s mainly content, communication, or simple tracking
(not automation), it belongs here.*



### 3) Application solutions (coded, scripted, low‑code, and no‑code)

Anything built to automate work using logic—whether created with traditional
code or low‑code/no‑code tools.

* **Examples:** custom web apps/portals, workflow apps with rules and approvals,
  Power Apps-style solutions, scripts/jobs, spreadsheet macros, small team-built
  utilities
* **Typical traits:** includes business rules, needs an owner, should be tested
  and controlled, may require integrations and support
* **Primary purpose:** automate a process or deliver a repeatable capability
  that behaves like an application

**One‑liner test:** *If it contains business rules or automation that people
rely on, it belongs here.*



### 4) SaaS specialist applications

Vendor cloud products that deliver strong capability in a focused area and are
mostly configured rather than built.

* **Examples:** IT service management/helpdesk, contract lifecycle management,
  recruiting/ATS, expense tools, e‑signature, niche compliance tools
* **Typical traits:** subscription, quick rollout, frequent vendor updates,
  standard functionality, integrates via APIs/connectors
* **Primary purpose:** deliver best-in-class capability for a specific domain
  without adopting a full enterprise suite

**One‑liner test:** *If it’s a purchased cloud product that excels in a specific
function, it belongs here.*



### 5) Analytics and reporting platforms

Tools whose primary purpose is dashboards, reporting, metrics, and analysis (not
running day-to-day transactions).

* **Examples:** BI/reporting tools, dashboard platforms, enterprise reporting
  suites, governed self-service analytics, metrics/semantic layers
* **Typical traits:** focused on trusted metrics, consistent reporting,
  controlled access, performance for reporting and queries
* **Primary purpose:** support decision-making with consistent, reliable insight

**One‑liner test:** *If its main output is reports, dashboards, or analytics
used to make decisions, it belongs here.*

# Now With AI

## Software approaches (with AI impacts)

### 1) Core enterprise suites and transaction systems

Large, integrated systems that run foundational operations and hold trusted
operational records.

* **Examples:** ERP, core banking/claims, HR/payroll suites, enterprise CRM,
  mainframe transaction systems
* **Typical traits:** shared data, strong governance, many modules, heavy
  integration, long-lived
* **Primary purpose:** run the business and maintain authoritative operational
  truth
* **One‑liner test:** *If it’s the official system used to run core processes
  and keep the “book of record,” it belongs here.*
* **AI impact:** AI is increasingly **embedded into these platforms**
  (recommendations, “next best action,” automated case handling), but the value
  depends heavily on **data quality, controls, and clear accountability** for
  decisions and changes.



### 2) Productivity and collaboration artifacts

Office-style tools used as “digital paper” to communicate, coordinate, capture,
and track—without becoming an application.

* **Examples:** documents, slide decks, shared folders, Teams/Slack spaces,
  wikis, simple intake forms, checklists, basic spreadsheet trackers (no
  automation)
* **Typical traits:** fast to create, easy to share, team-owned, lightweight
  controls, risk increases when relied on operationally
* **Primary purpose:** support collaboration, documentation, and lightweight
  tracking
* **One‑liner test:** *If it’s mainly content, communication, or simple tracking
  (not automation), it belongs here.*
* **AI impact:** Copilots make these tools **far more powerful** (drafting,
  summarizing, searching across content), which increases speed—but also raises
  the need for **clear guidance on what data is appropriate to share** and how
  to avoid “polished but incorrect” outputs becoming official.



### 3) Application solutions (coded, scripted, low‑code, and no‑code)

Anything built to automate work using logic—whether created with traditional
code or low‑code/no‑code tools.

* **Examples:** custom web apps/portals, workflow apps with rules and approvals,
  low‑code/no‑code apps, scripts/jobs, spreadsheet macros, team-built utilities
* **Typical traits:** contains business rules, needs an owner, should be tested
  and controlled, often needs integrations and support
* **Primary purpose:** automate a process or deliver a repeatable capability
  that behaves like an application
* **One‑liner test:** *If it contains business rules or automation that people
  rely on, it belongs here.*
* **AI impact:**

  * AI can **accelerate delivery** (faster prototyping, faster changes) and
    enable more “self-serve” apps.
  * AI also enables **agent-like features inside apps** (apps that interpret
    requests and carry out steps), which increases the need for **strong
    guardrails, testing, and auditability** because the app is no longer fully
    predictable step-by-step.



### 4) SaaS specialist applications

Vendor cloud products that deliver strong capability in a focused area and are
mostly configured rather than built.

* **Examples:** IT service management/helpdesk, CLM, ATS/recruiting, expense
  tools, e‑signature, niche compliance tools
* **Typical traits:** subscription, quick rollout, frequent vendor updates,
  standard functionality, integrates via APIs/connectors
* **Primary purpose:** deliver best-in-class capability for a specific domain
  without adopting a full enterprise suite
* **One‑liner test:** *If it’s a purchased cloud product that excels in a
  specific function, it belongs here.*
* **AI impact:** SaaS vendors are rapidly shipping **embedded copilots and
  automation**; the key shift is that these tools may start to **take actions**,
  not just provide insights—so you’ll want clarity on **what it’s allowed to do,
  how it’s supervised, and how outcomes are tracked**.



### 5) Analytics and reporting platforms

Tools whose primary purpose is dashboards, reporting, metrics, and analysis (not
running day-to-day transactions).

* **Examples:** BI/reporting tools, dashboard platforms, enterprise reporting
  suites, governed self-service analytics, metrics/semantic layers
* **Typical traits:** focused on trusted metrics, consistent reporting,
  controlled access, performance for reporting and queries
* **Primary purpose:** support decision-making with consistent, reliable insight
* **One‑liner test:** *If its main output is reports, dashboards, or analytics
  used to make decisions, it belongs here.*
* **AI impact:** AI is shifting analytics from “find the right dashboard” to
  **ask a question and get an answer**—which can increase adoption dramatically,
  but puts more emphasis on **governed definitions of metrics** and lightweight
  validation so leaders don’t act on a compelling narrative that isn’t supported
  by the numbers.



### 6) Non‑Human‑Intelligences (NHIs)

AI-driven copilots, agents, and “digital workers” that can interpret intent,
generate outputs, and (in some cases) take actions across systems—sometimes with
minimal human step-by-step direction.

* **Examples:** chat copilots for employees, AI agents that resolve tickets or
  coordinate onboarding, unattended automations that execute multi-step tasks,
  meeting/action assistants, customer support agents, research/analysis agents
* **Typical traits:** operates more like a **helper or worker** than a
  traditional app; behavior can vary; requires controlled access to data and
  systems; needs supervision and traceability proportional to business risk
* **Primary purpose:** augment people and automate knowledge work by executing
  tasks, producing outputs, and coordinating work across tools
* **One‑liner test:** *If it can take a goal (“handle this request”) and produce
  work or actions with limited instruction, it belongs here.*
* **AI impact (why this category matters):** NHIs introduce a new “workforce
  layer” in the enterprise—so the big change is not just technology, but
  **operating model**: clear ownership, clear boundaries on what the NHI is
  allowed to do, and a practical way to review and learn from what it did.
