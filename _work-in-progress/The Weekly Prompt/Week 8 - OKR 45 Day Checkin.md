MIDPOINT PROMPT: 45‑DAY RECALIBRATION (OKRs + Execution Plan) — IC + Leader lenses

You are an OKR operating coach and execution strategist. We are at the midpoint of a 90‑day plan (around Day 45).
Your job is to diagnose what’s true right now, recalibrate the plan without thrash, and create a clear “second‑half” strategy that improves the probability of hitting (or responsibly adjusting) Q1 OKRs.

Generate TWO versions:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Optimize for what I can directly influence and execute.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Optimize for alignment, resourcing, cross-team dependencies, and decision-making.

INPUTS (paste what you have; if missing, make reasonable assumptions and mark them as [ASSUMPTION] or [TBD]):
- Q1 Objectives + Key Results (include baselines + targets):
- Current KR values (as of today):
- Weekly KR trend (if known): list the last 4–6 data points or “unknown”
- Planned initiatives from the 90‑day execution plan:
- What has actually been completed so far:
- Current risks/blockers:
- New information since kickoff (org changes, staffing, budget, priority shifts, incidents, market changes):
- Non‑Goals / guardrails:
- Remaining capacity for the next 45 days (high/med/low + constraints):
- Stakeholders + dependencies (who we rely on and who relies on us):

NON‑NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- Do NOT rewrite everything. Preserve stability unless a change is clearly necessary.
- Separate three things: (1) OKRs (outcomes), (2) initiatives (work), (3) resourcing/cadence (how we execute).
- Be explicit about tradeoffs: any new initiative requires removing or pausing something else.
- If a KR is “off track,” propose specific corrective actions AND a credible alternative (scope adjustment) with rationale.
- Keep it plain language. No fluff. Make the plan usable next Monday.

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses)
Keep each lens to ~1–2 pages max. Use the exact structure below.

SECTION 1 — EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT (6 lines max)
- Overall status: On track / At risk / Off track
- Biggest win so far:
- Biggest problem / constraint:
- The 1–2 KRs that matter most in the remaining 45 days:
- The key tradeoff we must accept:
- The single decision needed most urgently:

SECTION 2 — KR HEALTH CHECK (scoreboard + diagnosis)
For each KR:
- Baseline → Target (by Day 90)
- Current value (Day 45)
- Trend: Improving / Flat / Worsening / Unknown
- Required pace for remaining 45 days (qualitative is fine if data missing)
- Status: On track / At risk / Off track
- Diagnosis (choose ONE primary cause):
  a) Not enough throughput
  b) Wrong work / weak linkage to KR
  c) Dependency stalled
  d) Quality/rework issues
  e) Measurement problem (bad metric / missing baseline)
  f) Scope too large for timeframe
  g) Priority conflict / capacity mismatch
- Fix hypothesis (1 sentence)

SECTION 3 — WHAT TO KEEP / STOP / START (the recalibration)
A) KEEP (3 bullets)
- What is working and should continue unchanged.

B) STOP or PAUSE (3–5 bullets)
- Be specific. Include the work, meeting, or behavior that should stop.
- For each: why it’s not paying off + what capacity it frees.

C) START or CHANGE (3–5 bullets)
- New or adjusted initiatives that directly address off-track KRs.
- Each item must map to a KR and include “why this will move it.”

SECTION 4 — INITIATIVE PORTFOLIO (updated)
Produce a prioritized list:
- Tier 1: Must-win initiatives (3–5)
- Tier 2: Nice-to-have initiatives (2–4)
- Parking Lot: Not this quarter (as needed)

For each Tier 1 initiative, include:
- Mapped KR(s)
- Owner
- Dependency (if any)
- “Done means…” definition
- First milestone date (within the next 2 weeks)

SECTION 5 — SECOND-HALF PLAN (Days 46–90)
Lay out the remaining work as 3 checkpoints:
- Checkpoint 1 (next 2 weeks): milestones + expected KR movement
- Checkpoint 2 (following 2 weeks): milestones + expected KR movement
- Checkpoint 3 (final stretch): milestones + expected KR movement
Include at least one demo/review moment per checkpoint.

SECTION 6 — DECISIONS, ESCALATIONS, AND ASKS
- Decisions needed (1–3): decision owner + deadline + consequence if delayed
- Escalations required (if any): what to escalate, to whom, and why
- Asks (up to 3): specific person/team + exact ask + by when

SECTION 7 — OKR ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS (only if needed)
If any KR is Off track, provide TWO options:
Option A: Recovery plan (keep KR target)
- What must change + what gets cut + probability of success (Low/Med/High)

Option B: Responsible adjustment (change target/scope)
- Proposed adjusted target or wording + why it preserves intent + what we learn
- Include how we will communicate the adjustment without losing credibility

SECTION 8 — WEEKLY OPERATING RHYTHM (tighten execution)
Propose the minimum weekly rhythm for the second half:
- Weekly scorecard review: attendees + agenda (5 bullets)
- Delivery cadence: demo/review moments
- Focus protection rule (1 sentence)
- One metric we will review every week no matter what

SECTION 9 — COMMUNICATION (post-ready)
Write a 6–8 line update suitable for Viva Engage/LinkedIn:
- 1 line: the honest midpoint reality
- 2–3 lines: what’s working + evidence
- 1–2 lines: what’s changing (stop/start)
- 1 line: the tradeoff we’re making
- 1 line: what success looks like by Day 90
- 1 line: one lesson learned

Return only the two recalibration outputs (IC and Leader). No extra commentary.
