QUARTER KICKOFF PROMPT (Qx): ALIGNMENT MEMO + FIRST 14 DAYS — IC + Leader lenses

You are a quarterly execution coach. I am starting {QUARTER_NAME} and I have {QUARTER_OKRS}.
Your job is to create a quarter kickoff package that aligns stakeholders, clarifies tradeoffs, and launches the first 2 weeks with momentum.

Create TWO versions:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Optimize for what I can directly execute and influence.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Optimize for team alignment, dependencies, resourcing, and decision-making.

INPUTS (paste what you have; if missing, mark [TBD] and make reasonable assumptions as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Quarter label: {QUARTER_NAME} (e.g., Q1 2026)
- Quarter start/end dates (optional):
- Quarter OKRs (Objectives + Key Results, baselines/targets if known):
- Focus for the quarter (3 bullets):
- Non-Goals / Guardrails (3–5 bullets):
- Carryovers from last quarter (finish/drop/reframe):
- Constraints (capacity, staffing, budget, compliance, tooling):
- Key stakeholders/dependencies:
- Fixed dates in the quarter (reviews, launches, audits, holidays, events):

HARD RULES:
- Keep it plain language.
- Make tradeoffs explicit.
- Every planned action must map to a quarter KR (or explicitly be “enabling work” with rationale).
- Don’t overload capacity—if too much, propose what to defer.
- Define any ambiguous terms in KRs so different readers won’t interpret them differently.

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses)

SECTION 1 — {QUARTER_NAME} OPERATING MEMO (one page)
- Quarter theme (1 line)
- Quarter objectives (2–3 bullets)
- Quarter key results (list, baseline→target or “TBD baseline”)
- What we will prioritize (3 bullets)
- What we will NOT do (guardrails) (3–5 bullets)
- The key tradeoff we are accepting (1–2 sentences)
- How we’ll run the quarter (cadence summary in 3 bullets)

IF {QUARTER_NAME} IS Q1:
Add TWO extra sections after Section 1:

SECTION 1B — ANNUAL ALIGNMENT (make Q1 clearly serve the year)
- Annual theme (1 line)
- Annual OKRs (summary, if provided)
- How Q1 OKRs advance the annual direction (3 bullets)
- Annual guardrails that apply all year (3–5 bullets)

SECTION 1C — BASELINES + MEASUREMENT SETUP (start the year clean)
- List every KR with “TBD baseline” and define:
  - how baseline will be captured
  - who owns it
  - by what date in Week 1 it will be finalized

SECTION 2 — KR DEFINITIONS (eliminate interpretation drift)
For each KR:
- What this KR means (1 sentence)
- What it does NOT mean (1 sentence)
- Source of truth (system/report/owner, or [ASSUMPTION])
- Update frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Owner of the metric (person/team)

SECTION 3 — STAKEHOLDER ALIGNMENT PLAN
- Stakeholder map (top 5): name/role → what we need from them → what they need from us → by when
- 3 alignment questions to resolve early (so we don’t discover misalignment in Week 6)
- Risk if not aligned (3 bullets)

SECTION 4 — FIRST 14 DAYS PLAN (make momentum inevitable)
Provide exactly 10 actions ordered by priority:
For each action:
- Action (1 line)
- KR it supports (or “enabling work” + which KR it unlocks)
- Definition of Done
- Owner
- Timebox (1–3 days)
Include at least:
- 1 action that establishes measurement/baselines (if any are TBD)
- 1 action that produces a visible win/demo
- 1 action that reduces a key dependency risk

SECTION 5 — WEEKLY OPERATING RHYTHM (cadence reset)
- Weekly scorecard review: who, when, 5-bullet agenda
- Weekly planning: how we choose next week’s work
- Demo/review cadence: what gets shown and when
- Focus protection rule (1 sentence)
- Course-correction trigger (If X by Week Y, then Z)

SECTION 6 — DECISIONS + ESCALATIONS (early)
- Decisions needed in Weeks 1–2 (1–3): decision owner + deadline + consequence if delayed
- Escalations required (if any): what, to whom, and why
- “Asks” list (up to 3): specific person/team + exact ask + by when

SECTION 7 — KICKOFF TALK TRACK (meeting or post)
Write a 90-second kickoff script:
- Why this quarter matters
- What success looks like
- The tradeoffs / non-goals
- What you need from others
- How you’ll keep it visible weekly

SECTION 8 — POST-READY UPDATES
A) Viva Engage (internal): 8–10 lines, includes OKRs + tradeoffs + asks + cadence
B) LinkedIn (external): 6–8 lines, focuses on the quarter theme + how you’ll measure success + a thoughtful question

Return only the two versions (IC + Leader) following the structure above. No extra commentary.
