NEXT WEEKLY PROMPT: 90‑DAY EXECUTION PLAN (Q1) — built from your OKRs
(Produces both IC + Leader versions)

You are an execution coach and pragmatic program planner. I already have Annual OKRs and Q1 OKRs.
Your job is to convert my Q1 OKRs into a realistic 90‑day execution plan that protects focus, sequences work, and creates a weekly operating rhythm.

Generate TWO versions:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Optimize for what I can directly execute and influence.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Optimize for team alignment, resourcing, cross-team dependencies, and decision-making.

INPUTS (ask the user to fill this in with what they have. You will then fill in
what you can if its missing, make reasonable assumptions and mark them as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Vision statement:
- Mission statement:
- Annual OKRs (Objectives + Key Results):
- Q1 OKRs (Objectives + Key Results):
- Non-Goals / Guardrails:
- Role / title:
- Team / function (if any):
- Capacity available for “OKR work” (e.g., % of time) + any fixed commitments:
- Known deadlines / events in the next 90 days:
- Constraints (budget, staffing, compliance, tooling, approvals):
- Key stakeholders + dependencies (who I/we rely on):
- Risks I’m already worried about (optional):

HARD RULES:
- Do NOT invent more work than capacity allows.
- If the OKRs are too broad for 90 days, propose a scoped “Q1 interpretation” of them (without changing intent).
- Separate outcomes (OKRs) from initiatives (work). Initiatives are means, not ends.
- Every initiative must map to at least one Key Result.
- Make tradeoffs explicit: for each included initiative, note what gets deferred.
- Keep it plain language. No jargon. No fluff.

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses)
Keep each lens to ~one page plus a compact appendix. Use the exact structure below.

SECTION 1 — Q1 OKR RECAP (context)
- List Q1 Objectives (2–3 max) and their KRs (as given).
- Add 1 sentence: “What success looks like by Day 90.”

SECTION 2 — EXECUTION STRATEGY (how we’ll win)
- 3–5 bullets describing the approach (e.g., sequence, “thin slice first,” reduce risk early, measure weekly).

SECTION 3 — INITIATIVE PORTFOLIO (the work that drives the KRs)
Create a table-like list with 5–9 initiatives total, each with:
- Initiative name
- Mapped KR(s)
- Expected impact (High/Med/Low)
- Effort (S/M/L)
- Owner (me/us + dependencies)
- “Definition of Done” (1 sentence)
Then:
- Select the TOP 3–5 initiatives that will actually be staffed.
- Create a “Parking Lot / Not This Quarter” list for the rest (tie back to Non-Goals).

SECTION 4 — 90‑DAY PLAN (week-by-week milestones)
Break the quarter into 6 bi-weekly checkpoints (or 13 weeks, your choice).
For each checkpoint include:
- Primary milestone(s) / deliverable(s)
- KR(s) expected to move (and how we’ll know)
- Key dependency/decision needed
- Demo / review moment (what will be shown, to whom)

SECTION 5 — WEEKLY OPERATING RHYTHM (the cadence)
Define the minimum rhythm that keeps execution real:
- Weekly OKR scorecard review (what metrics, when, who attends)
- Weekly planning (how we pick next week’s work)
- Stakeholder update cadence (who gets what, when)
- “Deep work” protection rule (how we prevent meeting sprawl)
Include 1 simple agenda for the weekly scorecard review.

SECTION 6 — RISKS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND TRIGGERS
- Top 5 risks + mitigations
- Top 5 assumptions (label [ASSUMPTION] clearly)
- 3 “course-correction triggers” (e.g., “If KR hasn’t moved by Week 4, then …”)

SECTION 7 — FIRST 10 DAYS (make it real fast)
Provide exactly 10 actions, in priority order, that I/we can start immediately.
Each action must be:
- Small enough to complete within 1–3 days
- Clearly tied to an initiative and KR

SECTION 8 — COMMUNICATION + ALIGNMENT PLAN
- Stakeholder map: “Need from / Give to” for key partners
- Update template (5 lines) I can paste into LinkedIn/Viva Engage or internal updates:
  - What we did
  - What we’re doing next
  - KR movement
  - Risks/asks
  - Decisions needed

SECTION 9 — END-OF-Q1 EXIT CRITERIA + RETRO
- “Done means…” (3 bullets)
- Retro prompts (5 bullets): what to keep, stop, start, and what to change about the OKRs for Q2.

Return only the two execution plans (IC + Leader) following the structure above. No extra commentary.
