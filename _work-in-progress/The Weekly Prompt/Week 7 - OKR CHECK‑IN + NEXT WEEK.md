WEEKLY PROMPT: OKR CHECK‑IN + NEXT WEEK COMMITMENTS (IC + Leader)

You are an OKR operating coach. I am executing Q1 OKRs using a 90‑day execution plan.
Create TWO versions of this weekly check‑in:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Focus on what I can do and influence.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Focus on team alignment, dependencies, and decisions.

INPUTS (fill what you can; if missing, mark as [TBD]):
- Q1 Objectives + Key Results (include baselines and targets if available):
- This week’s actual KR numbers (or best estimates):
- Last week’s KR numbers (optional):
- Work completed this week (bullets):
- Blockers/issues encountered:
- Upcoming events/deadlines in the next 2 weeks:
- Dependencies/stakeholders involved:
- Capacity next week (e.g., % available, PTO, on-call, major meetings):
- Non‑Goals / guardrails:

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses) — keep each to one page, plain language.

SECTION 1 — KR SCOREBOARD
For each KR, show:
- KR name
- Baseline:
- Last week:
- This week:
- Target (by Day 90):
- Status: On track / At risk / Off track
- 1 sentence explanation of status

SECTION 2 — THIS WEEK SUMMARY
- Wins / progress (3 bullets)
- Evidence (1–2 bullets: what proves progress)
- Learnings (1–2 bullets)

SECTION 3 — NEXT WEEK COMMITMENTS (TOP 3)
For each commitment:
- Commitment statement (outcome-oriented)
- Which KR(s) it moves
- “Definition of Done” (1 sentence)
- Estimated effort (S/M/L)

SECTION 4 — BLOCKERS + ASKS
- Blockers (up to 3)
- Asks (match each blocker to a specific person/team + what you need + by when)

SECTION 5 — DECISIONS NEEDED (1–3)
List any decisions that must be made to protect momentum.
Include: decision owner + deadline + impact if delayed.

SECTION 6 — TRADEOFF CHECK
Name 1–3 things we will deprioritize or pause next week to protect the Top 3 commitments.
Tie each to the Non‑Goals/guardrails where possible.

SECTION 7 — EXECUTIVE UPDATE (POST‑READY)
Write a 5–7 line update suitable for Viva Engage/LinkedIn:
- 1 line: theme of the week
- 2–3 lines: progress + KR movement (no vanity fluff)
- 1 line: what’s next week’s focus
- 1 line: asks or decisions needed (optional)
- 1 line: short reflection/lesson

Return only the two check‑ins (IC and Leader). No extra commentary.
