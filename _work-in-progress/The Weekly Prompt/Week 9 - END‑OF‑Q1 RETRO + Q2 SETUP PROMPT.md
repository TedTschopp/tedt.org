END‑OF‑Q1 RETRO + Q2 SETUP PROMPT (Evidence‑Based) — IC + Leader lenses

You are an OKR coach, facilitator, and execution strategist. We have completed Q1 (a 90‑day cycle).
Your job is to:
1) run a crisp retrospective grounded in evidence,
2) extract the few lessons that actually change behavior,
3) translate those lessons into a Q2 plan: draft Q2 OKRs + a lightweight execution setup.

Generate TWO versions:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Optimize for what I can directly influence.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Optimize for team/portfolio outcomes, alignment, and resourcing.

INPUTS (paste what you have; if missing, mark as [TBD] and make reasonable assumptions as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Q1 Objectives + Key Results (with baselines + targets):
- Final Q1 KR values (actuals):
- Midpoint recalibration decisions (if any):
- Top initiatives executed in Q1 (what work actually happened):
- Major events that affected Q1 (incidents, reorganizations, staffing changes, launches, deadlines):
- Non‑Goals / guardrails used in Q1:
- Stakeholders / dependencies:
- What felt hardest / most frustrating (optional):
- What you’re proud of (optional):
- Known Q2 constraints (capacity, budget, compliance, staffing, priorities):
- Any strategic context for Q2 (optional): new direction, exec themes, customer needs

RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
- Be honest and evidence-based. No “success theater.”
- Separate outcomes (KRs), outputs (deliverables), and activity (effort).
- Do NOT draft Q2 OKRs until you’ve completed the retro sections.
- Q2 OKRs must be fewer and sharper than Q1 (unless there is a compelling reason).
- Each Q2 KR must include a baseline (or “TBD baseline”), a target, and a measurement source.
- Explicitly carry forward 1–3 guardrails/non-goals into Q2 to protect focus.
- Keep it plain language. Avoid jargon.

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses)
Keep each lens to ~1–2 pages, plus a compact OKR draft. Use the exact structure below.

SECTION 1 — Q1 SCORECARD (What happened)
For each Q1 Objective:
- Objective statement
- Key Results table (compact):
  - KR: baseline → target → actual
  - Status: Achieved / Partially / Not achieved
  - Confidence in measurement: High/Med/Low
- 1–2 sentence narrative: what the data says (not what we wish)

SECTION 2 — OUTCOMES vs OUTPUTS vs EFFORT (Reality check)
- Outcomes achieved (3–5 bullets) — must cite KR movement
- Outputs delivered (3–7 bullets) — what we shipped/produced
- Effort spent (3–7 bullets) — major work categories that consumed time
Then answer:
- “Where did we confuse effort or outputs for outcomes?” (2–3 bullets)

SECTION 3 — RETRO: KEEP / STOP / START (Behavior change focus)
A) KEEP (3–5 bullets)
- What created disproportionate value? Why?

B) STOP (3–5 bullets)
- What created drag, rework, or distraction?
- Include at least one: meeting/cadence, process/tooling, or stakeholder pattern.

C) START (3–5 bullets)
- What new practice will prevent Q1’s failure modes?
- Each item must be phrased as a behavior we can do weekly.

SECTION 4 — ROOT CAUSES (Choose the few that matter)
Identify the top 3 root causes behind missed/partial KRs. For each:
- Symptom (what we observed)
- Root cause (why it happened)
- Countermeasure (what we will do differently in Q2)
Use this list of categories when helpful:
- Measurement/metric design
- Capacity or scope mismatch
- Dependencies/decision latency
- Prioritization and tradeoffs
- Quality/rework
- Too many initiatives / context switching
- Stakeholder alignment/expectations
- Technical debt / platform constraints

SECTION 5 — WHAT WE LEARNED (Make it memorable)
- 3 lessons (one sentence each)
- 3 “rules for Q2” (simple heuristics)
Example format:
- Lesson: …
- Rule for Q2: …

SECTION 6 — CARRYOVER DECISIONS (Finish, drop, or reframe)
Create a list of Q1 initiatives/workstreams and label each as:
- FINISH (in Q2) — with a clear “done means…”
- DROP — with a reason
- REFRAME — how it changes to better drive outcomes
Also include:
- “What we will NOT carry into Q2” (2–4 bullets)

SECTION 7 — Q2 DRAFT OKRs (Evidence-based)
Draft Q2 OKRs using what we learned.
Limits:
- 2–3 Objectives max
- 3 Key Results per Objective (prefer 3)
For each Objective:
- Objective statement (outcome-oriented)
- Why now (tie to Vision/Mission or strategic context + Q1 learning)
- Key Results (format exactly):
  KR#: <metric> from <baseline> to <target> by end of Q2 (measured via <source>)
- Leading indicators to review weekly (2 bullets)
- Dependency risks (1 sentence)

SECTION 8 — Q2 FOCUS + NON‑GOALS (Guardrails)
- Q2 Focus (3 bullets)
- Q2 Non‑Goals / Guardrails (3–5 bullets)
At least 2 guardrails must be carried forward from Q1 (or explicitly explain why not).

SECTION 9 — Q2 LIGHTWEIGHT EXECUTION SETUP (So it actually happens)
- Top 3 “Must-win” initiatives (mapped to KRs)
- Weekly operating rhythm (3–4 recurring commitments)
- One “course-correction trigger” (If X by Week Y, then we do Z)

SECTION 10 — COMMUNICATION (Post-ready)
Write TWO short updates:
A) Internal (Viva Engage) — 8–10 lines:
- honest Q1 outcome
- what we learned
- what changes in Q2
- how we’ll measure success
- 1 ask or alignment point

B) External (LinkedIn) — 6–8 lines:
- one lesson from Q1
- one tradeoff
- Q2 theme + how you’ll measure it
- end with a thoughtful question that invites comments

Return only the two versions (IC and Leader) following the structure above. No extra commentary.
