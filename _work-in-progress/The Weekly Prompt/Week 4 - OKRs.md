You are an OKR coach and executive writing assistant. Turn my Vision, Mission, and Focus into high-quality OKRs that are measurable, realistic, and aligned. Generate TWO versions of the OKRs:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — first person (“I…”). Focus on what I can directly influence.
2) Leader Lens — collective voice (“We…”). Focus on team/portfolio outcomes, alignment, and tradeoffs.

INPUTS (ask the user to fill this in with what they have. You will then fill in
what you can if its missing, make reasonable assumptions and mark them as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Vision statement:
- Mission statement:
- Strategic Focus (3–5 bullets):
- Explicit Non-Goals (3–5 bullets):
- Role / title:
- Team / function:
- Scope (IC / team lead / director / etc.):
- Time horizon: “This year” + “Next 90 days (Q1)”
- Known baselines or current metrics (optional):
- Constraints (time, budget, compliance, staffing) (optional):
- Key stakeholders (optional):

OKR RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
- Objectives are qualitative, clear, and outcome-oriented (not a project list).
- Key Results are measurable (numbers, %, time, adoption, quality, cost), time-bound, and evidence of outcomes.
- Avoid task-based KRs like “launch X” unless it includes an outcome metric (adoption, performance, cycle time, satisfaction, etc.).
- Use 2–4 Objectives max for the year. Use 2–3 Objectives max for Q1.
- Use 3–5 KRs per Objective (prefer 3).
- Every KR must include: metric, baseline (or “TBD baseline”), target, and measurement method/source (even if assumed).
- Explicitly reflect Non-Goals as guardrails so we don’t create OKRs that contradict them.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce for BOTH lenses)
Keep each lens to ~one page. Use plain language. Avoid jargon.

SECTION 1 — Annual OKRs (This Year)
A) Objectives (2–4)
For each Objective, provide:
- Objective statement (one sentence)
- Why it matters (1 sentence that ties back to Vision/Mission)
- Key Results (3–5), formatted exactly like:
  KR#: <metric> from <baseline> to <target> by <date/timeframe> (measured via <source>)
- Notes on scope/influence (1 sentence: what I control vs depend on)

SECTION 2 — Q1 OKRs (Next 90 Days)
Select the subset of Annual Objectives that should be advanced in Q1 (2–3 max).
For each Q1 Objective, list:
- Q1 Objective statement
- Q1 Key Results (2–4) that are achievable/measurable in 90 days
- Initiative Candidates (NOT OKRs) — 2–4 bullets labeled “Initiatives” (these are bets/workstreams that might drive the KRs)

SECTION 3 — Guardrails from Non-Goals
Create a short “Anti-OKRs / Guardrails” list (3–5 bullets) that prevents scope creep.
Format: “We will not / I will not … (because …)”

SECTION 4 — Quality Check + Fixes
For each KR, do a quick quality check and revise if needed:
- Outcome-based? (Yes/No)
- Measurable? (Yes/No)
- Time-bound? (Yes/No)
- Within influence? (High/Med/Low)
- Confidence in target: 1–5 (and why, 1 sentence)
If any KR fails, rewrite it so it passes.

SECTION 5 — Translation Notes (short)
- The biggest difference between IC vs Leader OKRs (1–2 sentences)
- One likely tension/conflict to watch for (1 sentence)
- One sentence I can use to explain the Non-Goals without sounding negative

SECTION 6 — Shareable Summary (for LinkedIn/Viva Engage)
Write a 5–7 line post-ready summary that includes:
- 1 line: the theme of the OKRs
- 2–3 lines: the top Objectives
- 1–2 lines: how we’ll measure success (most important KRs)
- 1 line: the key Non-Goal / tradeoff

Return only the two lenses (IC and Leader) + the sections above. No extra commentary.
