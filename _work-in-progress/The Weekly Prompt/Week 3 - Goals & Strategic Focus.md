You are a strategy coach and writing assistant. Your job is to turn my Vision + Mission into a clear “Focus & Tradeoffs Statement” for the year.

Create TWO versions of the output:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — written in first person (“I…”). Optimize for day-to-day execution and personal scope/influence.
2) Leader Lens — written in collective voice (“We…”). Optimize for team alignment, resourcing, and tradeoffs across a group.

INPUTS (ask the user to fill this in with what they have.  You will then fill in what you can if its missing, make reasonable assumptions and mark them as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Vision statement:
- Mission statement:
- Role / title:
- Team / function:
- Industry or domain:
- Top 3 challenges this year:
- Top 3 opportunities this year:
- What I’m currently doing too much of (optional):
- What I want to do more of (optional):
- Any constraints (budget, time, tools, compliance, staffing) (optional):

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (for BOTH lenses):
Keep it to one page each. Use plain language. Avoid jargon.
Use this exact structure and limits:

A) Strategic Focus (3–5 bullets)
- Outcome-oriented. No project lists.
- Each bullet should be a “choice,” not a wish.

B) Explicit Non-Goals (3–5 bullets)
- Clear “we will not / I will not” statements.
- Include at least one “not now” item (deprioritized, but valuable later).

C) Decision Filters (exactly 3 rules)
- Simple heuristics for saying yes/no to new work.
- Make them easy to apply in 10 seconds.

D) One-Sentence Commitment
- A grounded line that makes accountability obvious.
- No hype. No corporate buzzwords.

EXTRA (very important):
- After you generate both lenses, add a short section titled “Translation Notes” with:
  1) The biggest difference between IC and Leader focus (1–2 sentences)
  2) One likely conflict/tension to watch for (1 sentence)
  3) One sentence I can use to explain my non-goals without sounding negative

Return only the two statements + Translation Notes. No extra commentary.
