WEEKLY PROMPT: VALUES + DECISION PRINCIPLES BUILDER (IC + Leader lenses)

You are a values facilitator and decision-systems coach. Turn my Vision/Mission (and, if provided, Focus/Non-Goals + OKRs) into a set of VALUES and DECISION PRINCIPLES that are practical, testable, and usable in real tradeoffs.

Generate TWO versions of the output:
1) Individual Contributor (IC) Lens — written in first person (“I…”). Optimized for daily choices within my influence.
2) Leader Lens — written in collective voice (“We…”). Optimized for team alignment, prioritization, and decision-making at scale.

INPUTS (paste what you have; if missing, make reasonable assumptions and mark them as [ASSUMPTION]):
- Vision statement:
- Mission statement:
- (Optional) Strategic Focus (3–5 bullets):
- (Optional) Non-Goals / Guardrails (3–5 bullets):
- (Optional) Annual OKRs + Q1/Qx OKRs:
- Role / title:
- Team / function and scope (IC / manager / director / etc.):
- Culture context (optional): what we’re proud of, what frustrates us
- Constraints (optional): time, budget, compliance, staffing, tooling
- Top 5 recurring dilemmas we face (examples: speed vs quality, innovation vs reliability, stakeholder conflict, scope creep, meeting load, security vs usability)

HARD RULES:
- Values must be ACTIONABLE (not vague virtues like “excellence” without meaning).
- Decision principles must be TESTABLE (clear enough that two people can apply them and reach the same conclusion).
- Include boundaries: “what it means” and “what it does not mean.”
- Make tradeoffs explicit (values can conflict; show how to resolve conflicts).
- Keep it plain language. Avoid corporate buzzwords.
- Keep each lens to ~one page plus a compact appendix.

OUTPUT FORMAT (for BOTH lenses)
Return the sections below in the exact order.

SECTION 1 — VALUES (5–7 max)
For each value, provide:
- Value name (2–4 words)
- Definition (1 sentence)
- “This looks like” behaviors (3 bullets)
- “This is not” behaviors (3 bullets)
- A real decision example (1–2 sentences: a tradeoff where this value guided the choice)
- A boundary test (1 question we can ask in the moment to check alignment)

SECTION 2 — DECISION PRINCIPLES (6–9 max)
Write each principle in this format:
- Principle: “When <situation>, we <default action>, because <reason>.”
Then add:
- How to apply (1 sentence)
- If this conflicts with another principle, what wins? (1 sentence; name the tie-breaker)

At least one principle must cover each category:
- Prioritization / scope control
- Speed vs quality
- Risk/compliance/security vs usability
- Stakeholder alignment / communication
- Investment in tech debt / foundations vs feature work
- Learning/experimentation vs standardization

SECTION 3 — DECISION FILTERS (FAST RULES)
Provide exactly 3 “10-second” filters we can use to say yes/no to new work.
Format:
- Filter #1: …
- Filter #2: …
- Filter #3: …

SECTION 4 — DEFAULTS + ESCALATION TRIGGERS
A) Default stances (fill both lists):
- Default YES list (3 bullets): what we generally say yes to
- Default NO list (3 bullets): what we generally decline/defer

B) Escalation triggers (3 bullets):
Format: “If <condition>, escalate to <role/person> within <timeframe>.”

SECTION 5 — SCENARIO DRILLS (make it usable)
For EACH of the top 5 dilemmas provided (or inferred), produce:
- Scenario (1 sentence)
- Recommended decision (1 sentence)
- Which value(s) apply (name 1–2)
- Which principle applies (name 1)
- What we will say out loud (a 1–2 sentence talk track that is calm and firm)

SECTION 6 — ALIGNMENT CHECK (quality gate)
- List 3 ways these values/principles reinforce the Vision + Mission.
- List 1–3 potential contradictions with Focus/Non-Goals/OKRs (if provided).
- If contradictions exist, propose edits (either to a value/principle OR to a non-goal) and explain why (2–4 bullets).

SECTION 7 — SHAREABLE SUMMARY (for LinkedIn/Viva Engage)
Write:
A) Internal post (Viva Engage): 8–10 lines
- The “why” (1–2 lines)
- The 3 most important values/principles (bulleted)
- The 3 decision filters (bulleted)
- One example scenario (2 lines)

B) External post (LinkedIn): 6–8 lines
- The idea: “Values aren’t posters; they’re decision rules.”
- 2–3 principles in plain language
- End with a question that invites others to share their decision principles

Return only the two lenses (IC and Leader) following the structure above. No extra commentary.
