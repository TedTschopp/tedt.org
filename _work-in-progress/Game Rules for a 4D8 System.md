# Game Rules for a 4D8 System

## Mechanics
To find out whether a character succeeded at an action, and how well, follow this basic procedure:
✧ The referee decides the ease of the task. This is rated on a scale of one to thirty-two, with 32 being extremely easy and 1 being extremely difficult.
✧ The player checks to see whether the character has any ability bonuses that assist him in the task. If so, these are added to (or subtracted from) the ease to produce a chance of success.
✧ If the chance of success is over 32, then the player can choose to have an automatic success, a doubles roll, or a bonus roll.
✧ The player rolls the dice. If the total rolled is greater than the chance of success, the character fails. If it is less than or equal to the chance of success, he succeeds. The degree of success is worked out.
✧ The referee interprets the degree of success in terms of the game situation.

## Ease
The referee is responsible for making final judgment on how easy any given task is. Many guidelines are given in these rules, but in the end, there will be many circumstances where the referee just has to estimate. Exercising judgment in this way is one of the most essential skills of being a referee.

As a general guideline, consider the average easy task to have an ease of 25 or 26. This means that an unskilled character has about a fifty-fifty chance of success. If this seems harsh, remember that this roll of the dice refers to a stressful situation. Where the character can work on a task at leisure, the ease will be even higher.

All other tasks’ eases are measured relative to this benchmark. Although there are some situations in which a task’s ease has a slightly different meaning, for general actions you can use the table below. 32 is the highest possible value of ease for a task. There is no lowest value. Also, although it says ‘impossible’ in the table below, remember that the impossible happens quite often in adventure fiction!

| Ease   | Meaning           |
|--------|-------------------|
| <1     | Impossible        |
| 1-2    | Almost impossible |
| 3-6    | Very difficult    |
| 7-12   | Challenging       |
| 13-18  | Relatively easy   |
| 19-26  | Easy              |
| 27-32  | Simple            |

## Abilities
The ease value decided above refers to the ease of the task to the average person. But characters may have strengths or weaknesses which make the task more or less easy. Again, the referee has final say on which abilities may be used in a given task, but it will usually be obvious which are applicable. For example, a character attempting to run away from an enemy may add any bonus for RUNNING to the ease of the task.

Referees should make sure that players do not abuse this system. In particular, players may attempt to argue that their characters may use a number of different ability bonuses. A character’s energy places a limit on the total ability bonuses he can use for a given task, but this may only encourage players to try to use all the bonuses they are allowed. The acid test is whether multiple abilities can be combined in one action. If not, the player will have to make separate dice rolls.

For example, a character tries to pick the lock of a locked door using THIEVERY, and the player then asserts that the character’s bonus in STRENGTH can also be used. However, using strength to barge a door is clearly a different thing from picking a lock; separate rolls must be made unless the lock is especially stiff. On the other hand, a bonus in CO-ORDINATION could be added, as it is obviously directly relevant.

Adding the abilities to the ease of the task produces the chance of success. In some special circumstances, there may be further modifiers, but they will be explained later.

## Necessary Abilities
Some actions are just so common that it isn’t necessary to have a special ability to have a go at it. Others, however, clearly require a little training or at least a general familiarity.

If the referee determines that a particular ability is required to perform an action, then any character will suffer a –8 to their chance of success unless:
✧ He has a positive bonus in the required ability, or
✧ The required ability is one of his occupation’s bonus skills.

## Dice Roll
Once you have settled on a chance of success, roll four dice. If the total of the four dice rolled is greater than the chance of success, then the character has failed. If the total of the dice is less than or equal to the chance of success, the character has succeeded.

You can then go on to find out how well they succeeded. The basic degree of success is the highest of the four dice rolled. So if the player rolled a 2, a 5, a 6, and an 8, for a total of 21, their degree of success would be 8.

If the four dice come up with the same number, this is a lucky break. The degree of success is the sum of the four dice. An exception to this is noted in Over Thirty-Two, below. Players should beware of four ones. These are called snake-eyes and may have unfortunate effects. Because of the bad luck, snake-eyes are an exception to the lucky break rule—they have a degree of success of 1.

## Over Thirty-Two
If the chance of success is 33 or over, the player faces a choice. Such a task is so easy that it is well within the abilities of the character. The player may choose to have an automatic success. In this case, rather than rolling the dice, she can simply place them on the table with one showing an 8 and the others showing 6, 5, and 4.

On the other hand, the character may extend himself, risking failure against the chance of a much greater degree of success. A player making a doubles roll succeeds on anything but a 32 (irrespective of the chance of success). There is no bonus to the degree of success, but she may score lucky breaks. A player making a bonus roll succeeds on anything but a roll of four eights. The number of points by which her chance of success exceeded 32 is then added to the highest of the four dice. This will alter both the total roll and the degree of success. It also means that lucky breaks are not possible. Unless otherwise stated, players with chances of success should be assumed to be making bonus rolls.

## Interpretation
The most important part of this system is using it to explain what happens in the game. Thus, the referee must use the degree of success to explain what the character actually did. The amount of explanation required will depend on the situation. In some cases, it’s enough simply to announce that the character was successful—the degree of success doesn’t matter too much. If the situation is tense, however, an exciting description of the result adds to the atmosphere and excitement of the game.

This game contains a number of examples that should help give you a feel for the meaning of degrees of success, but just as a general guideline:

| Degree of Success | Meaning                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1-4               | Barely succeeded by a whisker   |
| 5-8               | Unspectacular success           |
| 9-12              | Good result                     |
| 13-16             | Superb result                   |
| 17-20             | Exceptional success             |
| 21+               | Superhuman                      |

You’ll notice there is a correlation between ease and success. Both are rated on a very rough 1-32 scale. Once you get a feel for the significance of numbers on these scales, you’ll be able to visualize the events of the game better.

### Additional Rules for Special Dice Combinations

In the 4D8 system, each die represents one of the following aspects of humans: physical, mental, social, magical. These additional rules handle specific combinations of dice results:

#### Three Dice Being the Same
When three of the four dice show the same number, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Triplet Value**: Multiply the triplet value by 2.
2. **Sum of the Fourth Die**: Add the value of the fourth die to the result.

Example: If you roll 5, 5, 5, and 3, the degree of success would be \( (5 \times 2) + 3 = 13 \).

**Special Effect**: The character gains a significant advantage in the aspect that the three identical dice represent. This might mean an extraordinary feat of strength, a brilliant insight, an impressive social maneuver, or a powerful magical effect.

#### Two Dice Being the Same and the Other Two Being Another Value That Is the Same
When you roll two pairs of identical numbers, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Pair Sum**: Calculate the sum of the two pairs.
2. **Additional Bonus**: Add 5 to the result to represent the synergy between the pairs.

Example: If you roll 4, 4, 2, and 2, the degree of success would be \( (4 + 4 + 2 + 2) + 5 = 17 \).

**Special Effect**: The character achieves a well-rounded success that balances the benefits of both pairs' aspects. This could mean an action that is both physically and mentally adept, socially and magically balanced, or any other combination of aspects.

#### Two Dice Being the Same
When two of the four dice show the same number, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Pair Value**: Add the values of the pair.
2. **Highest Remaining Die**: Add the highest value of the remaining two dice.

Example: If you roll 6, 6, 3, and 1, the degree of success would be \( 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 \).

**Special Effect**: The character gains a noticeable benefit in the aspect that the pair represents, with an additional but lesser effect from the highest remaining die's aspect. This might be a strong physical action supported by quick thinking, or a persuasive social action with a touch of magic.

### Summary of Special Combinations

| Combination Type                            | Degree of Success Calculation                      | Special Effect                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Four Dice the Same                          | Sum of all four dice                               | Significant advantage in the represented aspect                               |
| Three Dice the Same                         | (Triplet Value x 2) + Fourth Die                   | Significant advantage in the triplet's aspect                                 |
| Two Pairs of Identical Numbers              | Sum of both pairs + 5                              | Balanced success between the pairs' aspects                                   |
| Two Dice the Same                           | Sum of the pair + Highest Remaining Die            | Noticeable benefit in the pair's aspect with an additional lesser effect      |

These rules provide a rich array of outcomes, allowing for nuanced and varied interpretations of character actions based on the dice results.

### Additional Rules for Special Dice Combinations

In the 4D8 system, each die represents one of the following aspects of humans: physical, mental, social, and magical. These additional rules handle specific combinations of dice results while taking into account the different aspects each die represents:

#### Three Dice Being the Same
When three of the four dice show the same number, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Triplet Value**: Multiply the triplet value by 2.
2. **Sum of the Fourth Die**: Add the value of the fourth die to the result.

Example: If you roll 5, 5, 5, and 3, the degree of success would be \( (5 \times 2) + 3 = 13 \).

**Special Effect**: The character gains an extraordinary boost in the aspect represented by the triplet, while the fourth aspect is moderately enhanced.
- **Physical**: An impressive physical feat that is also supported by another aspect (e.g., a powerful leap combined with quick thinking).
- **Mental**: A brilliant insight or solution that also considers physical execution, social impact, or magical influence.
- **Social**: A persuasive or charismatic action that is subtly supported by physical presence, mental sharpness, or magical charm.
- **Magical**: A powerful spell or magical effect that is bolstered by another aspect, such as physical endurance, mental focus, or social grace.

#### Two Dice Being the Same and the Other Two Being Another Value That Is the Same
When you roll two pairs of identical numbers, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Pair Sum**: Calculate the sum of the two pairs.
2. **Additional Bonus**: Add 5 to the result to represent the synergy between the pairs.

Example: If you roll 4, 4, 2, and 2, the degree of success would be \( (4 + 4 + 2 + 2) + 5 = 17 \).

**Special Effect**: The character achieves a well-rounded success that balances the benefits of the two pairs' aspects. The combination creates a scenario where the success is influenced by the interplay between the involved aspects.
- **Physical + Mental**: A physically demanding task that also requires mental agility, such as solving a puzzle while performing a challenging physical maneuver.
- **Physical + Social**: A social interaction that involves physical presence or actions, like impressing a crowd with a display of strength.
- **Physical + Magical**: A spell that requires physical actions to be cast, enhancing its effectiveness.
- **Mental + Social**: A strategic social maneuver that relies on mental acuity, like convincing someone through logical arguments.
- **Mental + Magical**: A spell that requires deep concentration and intellectual insight.
- **Social + Magical**: A charm or enchantment that is delivered through a social interaction, enhancing its impact.

#### Two Dice Being the Same
When two of the four dice show the same number, the degree of success is calculated as follows:

1. **Pair Value**: Add the values of the pair.
2. **Highest Remaining Die**: Add the highest value of the remaining two dice.

Example: If you roll 6, 6, 3, and 1, the degree of success would be \( 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 \).

**Special Effect**: The character gains a noticeable benefit in the aspect represented by the pair, with an additional but lesser effect from the highest remaining die's aspect.
- **Physical**: Enhanced physical action with additional support from either mental, social, or magical aspects (e.g., running swiftly while planning the route).
- **Mental**: A sharp mental action with support from physical, social, or magical aspects (e.g., solving a puzzle while under physical stress).
- **Social**: A persuasive or charismatic action with support from physical, mental, or magical aspects (e.g., negotiating with added charm or strength).
- **Magical**: A spell cast with support from physical, mental, or social aspects (e.g., casting a spell with a physical gesture or a convincing incantation).
