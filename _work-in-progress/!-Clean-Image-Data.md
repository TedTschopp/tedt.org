### Instructions
I want to change my old format to a new format. 

Please see below for the old and new format. 

If the new format is already present, then please do nothing and move to the next file.

If the old format has unexpected values, then please do nothing, except add a comment to the file indicating that the old format has unexpected values.

If the old format is not present, then please do nothing, except add a comment to the file indicating that there is no image data.

If the old data format is not present, then please add the new format, but with blank values after the comment mentioning that there is no image data.
