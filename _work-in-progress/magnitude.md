### Time Symbols

🌲 - Century. 100 years the age of a human life

🔟 - Decade. The length of a chapter in a human's life. 

🌍 - Annually. For you, this means something occurring or taking a year. 

🌱 - Seasonal. You experience events or activities that last a season. 

🌙 - Monthly / One Moon. In your life, things happen on a monthly basis or in sync with the lunar cycle, from full moon to full moon. A month is 4 weeks.

🔄 - Weekly. You find that some tasks or events occur every week. This is traditionally equivalent to a quarter of a month.

☀️ - Daily. In your culture, the day may start at sundown or sunrise. Regardless, some activities take a day to complete or occur daily.

⌚ - Watch of 4 hours. In your professional environments, the Watch is used to allocate work among teams. Some tasks may take a watch to finish, or they occur within each watch.

⏳ - This symbol represents an hour. Some tasks will take an hour, and some events happen hourly.

🔔 - This symbolizes 30 minutes. In various contexts, such as military or city life, bells ring on the hour and half-hour, helping communities coordinate tasks. 

⏱ - A moment, which is 90 seconds or (¹/₄₀) of an hour, represents "now" or being in the moment for you and most people in general.

⚡ - The lightning bolt symbolizes a Once, a Round, or a Combat round, each lasting 7.5 seconds, historically defined as a twelfth (¹/₁₂) of a moment. This is as fast as people can conceive things happening.

👁️ - You can even break down Onces into "Atoms of time," which are (¹/₄₇) of a Once. This measurement accounts for the time it takes for an eye to twinkle, hence the phrase "In the twinkling of an eye." Some events can interrupt Once actions, and they all occur in Atom time, with no specific order but guided by what's most awesome for the overall story, as decided by the Referee.



1. **🌲 Century** - A span of one hundred years, often seen as the duration of a human life.

2. **🔟 Decade** - A period of ten years, often considered a significant chapter in a person's life.

6. **🔄 Weekly** - Tasks or events that recur every week, traditionally seen as a quarter of a month.

7. **☀️ Daily** - Activities that take a day to complete or happen each day, starting either at sundown or sunrise, depending on your cultural context.

11. **⏱ Moment (90 seconds)** - Represents the immediate present or "now," equating to 90 seconds or one-fortieth of an hour.

12. **⚡ Once, Round, or Combat Round (7.5 seconds)** - A rapid duration, defined historically as one-twelfth of a moment, reflecting the quickest sequence of events perceivable by people.

13. **👁️ Atom of time (0.16 seconds)** - The smallest measurable unit in your time system, representing the duration of an eye's twinkle. It's used in fast-paced situations where events occur without specific order but are guided by the overarching narrative, as determined by the game Referee.
