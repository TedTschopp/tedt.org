Full Solution - Same as Project Above.  Uses new Omnibus Architecture Deliverable which is a combination of AVD and SAD and SES.  A Requirements Document would also be needed, which could be a combination of a BRD and SRS.
Platforms - Same as Project Above, but there is an IT solution needed before the Business Solution.  Uses Omnibus Architecture Deliverable. 
Digital Product - This will use the new PRD that has been created that can be used by people and GenAI.  This document can be completed in a day with GenAI and would replace BRD, SRS, AVD, SAD, SES.
AI Delivered Solutions - This would be a version of the Digital Products above, but delivered via "vibe coding" or the use of AI.  
Models, Data, & Insights - This is for a report, or a model, or a some new Information management approach.  This would be forwarded to Matt P and Murthy's team for delivery.  Delivery might be local to those teams or might require the reach out to ETS for PowerBI, etc.. This would use the new data and model templates that Nudesic created.  It would need no architecture deliverables if the Platform required is already in play.
Automations and Services - This would be for things like UiPath, APIs, to access data, etc...  This would require the use of the existing documentation only and bypass architecture. 
Enable Feature - This is a special version of the original Break fix.  Lets say someone needs a new plugin to the Power Platform, or a Add On installed in Edge, or a Teams Plugin turned on.  This would follow a process like Cloud SaaS, and wouldn't need architecture.
Experiments - This would be the R&D work that IT does.  This would require no real documentation other than a RAID log with a focus on Architecture.   The goal here would be to understand what work is needed to turn an experiment into any of the above work types.
Advise & Strategy - This would be the standard portfolio White Papers, Business Architecture Narratives, Architecture Visions, Roadmaps, Enterprise Patterns.  This would be where Tech Consults go.
