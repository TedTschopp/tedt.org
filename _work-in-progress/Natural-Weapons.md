Certainly, expanding your table to include Sting, Spines/Quills, and Beak as natural weapons with their respective attributes across different game systems enhances both the variety and depth of your TTRPG. Here's how these could be represented:

| Natural Weapons | D&D | Cypher | AGE | YZE | Gear | Crit | B&B | Properties |
|:----------------|:----|:-------|:----|:----|:-----|:-----|:----|:-----------|
| Sting | 1d4 | 2 | 1d6 | 1 | Gear +0 | Crit 2 | +d4 | Finesse, Piercing, Poison (Optional) |
| Spines/Quills | 1d4 or Reaction | 2 or Reaction | 1d6 or Reaction | 1 or Reaction | Gear +0 | Crit 2 | +0 or Reaction | Piercing, Reaction (when hit) |
| Beak | 1d6 | 3 | 1d6+1 | 2 | Gear +0 | Crit 2 | +d6 | Piercing or Slashing |

### Explanations:

- **Sting**: Represents attacks from creatures like scorpions or fantasy beasts, potentially delivering venom. The option for poison effects can lead to additional damage or status effects as determined by your game's mechanics.
  
- **Spines/Quills**: This weapon type could be used actively in an attack or reactively, inflicting damage on creatures that make physical contact with the wielder. The "Reaction" tag suggests that this weapon can cause damage in response to being hit in melee, depending on your game's rules for reactions or passive damage.
  
- **Beak**: With a focus on pecking or tearing, the beak is more versatile in terms of the damage it can deal, suitable for characters or creatures designed to mimic avian or certain dinosaur-like attacks. The damage type can be chosen based on the creature's nature or the specific action being performed.

These additions not only broaden the arsenal of natural weapons available in your game but also introduce new tactical considerations for players and NPCs alike, enriching the combat experience and strategic depth of your TTRPG.


To incorporate a more versatile and not always harmful version of "Acid Spray," which can include substances like water for non-lethal or utility purposes, let's redefine this natural weapon as "Spray Attack." This broadens the scope, allowing for various substances to be sprayed, each with different potential effects. Here's how it might look in your table:

| Natural Weapons | D&D | Cypher | AGE | YZE | Gear | Crit | B&B | Properties |
|:----------------|:----|:-------|:----|:----|:-----|:-----|:----|:-----------|
| Spray Attack | 1d4 or special | 2 or special | 1d6 or special | 1 or special | Gear +0 | Crit 2 | +d4 or special | Variable (Piercing, Bludgeoning, etc.), Range, Special Effects |

### Explanations:

- **Spray Attack**: This general category includes various substances that a creature can expel, from acid to water, and potentially others like oil, sticky goo, or even a blinding flash. The actual effect can be customized based on the substance:
  - **Acid**: Causes damage over time, potentially weakening armor or obstacles.
  - **Water**: Could be used for utility purposes (extinguishing fires, cleaning), to distract or disorient foes, or to push objects or creatures with the force of the spray.
  - **Oil**: Could make surfaces slippery, trap enemies, or prepare an area for ignition.
  - **Sticky Goo**: Might immobilize or slow down targets.
  - **Blinding Flash**: A non-substance-based effect that temporarily blinds or disorients opponents, using the 'spray' concept as a metaphor for the spread of the effect.

For the "special" notation in damage or effects, you might define specific rules or outcomes based on the substance used in the Spray Attack. This allows for flexibility in your game design, encouraging creative applications by players and adding depth to encounters with creatures capable of such attacks.

For the "Web (Silk Spray)" natural weapon, which reflects the ability to produce and use webbing for various effects such as trapping, immobilizing, or creating obstacles, the table entry might look like this:

| Natural Weapons | D&D | Cypher | AGE | YZE | Gear | Crit | B&B | Properties |
|:----------------|:----|:-------|:----|:----|:-----|:-----|:----|:-----------|
| Web (Silk Spray) | Special | Special | Special | Special | Gear +0 | Crit 2 | Special | Entangling, Ranged, Restraining, Area Control |

### Explanations:

- **Web (Silk Spray)**: This attack doesn't directly deal damage in most cases but has versatile uses in combat and environmental interaction. The "Special" designation indicates that its primary function is not to inflict damage but to apply effects such as entanglement or area denial. Its effects across different game systems might include:
  
  - **D&D (Dungeons & Dragons)**: Could require a saving throw to avoid being restrained or to break free once entangled. Might cover an area with webbing that is difficult terrain and lightly obscures it.
  
  - **Cypher System**: Might impose a difficulty increase on actions to move or attack while entangled, or require a might task to escape.
  
  - **AGE (Adventure Game Engine)**: Could use a TN (Target Number) for characters to beat with an ability test to avoid or escape the webbing.
  
  - **YZE (Year Zero Engine)**: Might use a skill check to avoid or a strength check to break free from the webbing, with failures potentially leading to being immobilized or hindered.
  
The webbing could also have other uses, such as creating makeshift barriers, bridges, or shelters, depending on how creative players want to get. Its inclusion not only adds strategic depth to combat scenarios but also encourages problem-solving and innovative thinking in various situations.
