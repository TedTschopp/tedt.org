# Escalation and Deescalation: How to add extend conflict beyond combat

One of my favorite rules I have run into is the Dogs in the Vineward's rule of Escalation.  The reason I like it is that it means that conflict is both a social as well as physical problem.  In the Märchen Engine, I am trying to expand TTRPGs to downplay physical conflict and emphasize social, intellectual, and magical conflict.

## Escalation in Dogs in the Vineyard

In Dogs in the Vineyard, the Escalation rule is a crucial mechanic that governs conflict resolution. When a conflict arises between characters, it starts with discussion or negotiation. If the situation escalates beyond words, the characters roll dice to determine the outcome.

Each side involved in the conflict rolls dice based on their traits, skills, and the stakes of the conflict. The side with the highest total after rolling wins the conflict. However, here's where the Escalation rule comes into play: if you lose a conflict and want to continue pursuing your goals, you can escalate the conflict.

Escalating the conflict means you're willing to resort to more extreme measures to achieve your objectives. This could involve using violence, intimidation, or other forceful actions. When you escalate, you add more dice to your pool, representing the increased intensity of the conflict.

However, escalating also carries risks. It can escalate the situation further, potentially leading to more severe consequences or even violence spiraling out of control. Additionally, escalating can strain relationships and lead to long-term consequences for your character.

In essence, the Escalation rule in Dogs in the Vineyard emphasizes the escalation of conflict and the consequences of resorting to more extreme measures in pursuit of your goals. It adds depth and tension to conflicts within the game, reflecting the moral dilemmas faced by the characters in their roles as "Dogs" enforcing the law in a frontier setting.

## How should deescalation work

If I were to use the above as an approach to describe deescalation I would come up with the following:

A Deescalation rule is a pivotal mechanic that governs conflict resolution by emphasizing the importance of diffusing tense situations. When characters find themselves embroiled in a conflict, whether it be verbal sparring or physical altercation, they have the option to pursue deescalation.

Similar to the Escalation rule, which sees characters ramping up the intensity of conflicts, Deescalation allows characters to strive for resolution through peaceful means. When faced with a conflict, if you recognize the potential for escalation and its associated risks, you can opt to deescalate the situation.

Deescalating involves employing diplomacy, negotiation, empathy, or other non-violent tactics to calm tensions and find a mutually acceptable resolution. Instead of adding dice to your pool as in escalation, deescalation involves taking steps to reduce the stakes and lower the intensity of the conflict.

However, just like escalation, deescalation carries its own set of challenges and risks. It requires finesse, communication skills, and sometimes sacrifice to reach a peaceful resolution. Additionally, not all conflicts can be deescalated successfully, and attempting to do so may leave characters vulnerable or unable to achieve their objectives.

Ultimately, the Deescalation rule underscores the importance of seeking peaceful solutions, highlighting the moral complexity of conflict resolution and the potential consequences of choosing violence over diplomacy. It adds depth and nuance to gameplay, reflecting the diverse range of approaches characters can take in navigating challenging situations within the game world.
