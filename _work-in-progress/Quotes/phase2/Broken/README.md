# Phase 2 Deferred Quote Sources

These quote source files were deferred for Phase 2 date normalization.

Criteria:
* Missing concrete date (blank or vague like century)
* Century-only dates (e.g., "16th century", "18th century", "2nd century")
* Will later receive researched precise dates or alternative metadata strategy.

Guidelines:
* Keep full original front matter/content intact here.
* Do NOT rename into standard Jekyll post filenames until a real YYYY-MM-DD is decided.
* When researched, add `original-date:` (textual) and promote normalized date to `date:`.
