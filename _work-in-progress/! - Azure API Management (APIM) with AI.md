## Overview

### High Level Needs

* AI models are accessed ad hoc without standardization or documentation, relying heavily on the architect's knowledge for functionality use.
* Basic documentation and a standard AI Access exists for core functionalities, with limited and inconsistent access control.
* Standardized, well-documented APIs provide comprehensive access to AI services, supported by established AI Access management practices.
* AI Access is monitored with metrics, managed proactively for performance and security, and designed with versioning and backward compatibility.
* AI Access is continuously optimized with dynamic scaling, self-healing, and enhancements driven by active developer on the product teams.

### Key Concepts

* A foundational framework for interacting with AI models and services via standardized interfaces.
* Ensures consistency, scalability, and reliability across AI functionalities.
* Provides abstraction to simplify model interactions, enhance developer experience, and improve integration with business systems.
* Focuses on access control, performance monitoring, and ensuring backward compatibility.
* Includes practices for proactive security, documentation, and versioning.
* Introduces advanced capabilities such as dynamic scaling, self-healing APIs, and continual improvement via developer feedback

### Expected Benefits

* Standardization: Ensures consistent access and interaction with AI services, minimizing redundancy and enhancing integration.
* Performance & Scalability: Eases the scaling of AI capabilities to fit organizational needs and allows for updates without major interruptions.
* Security & Governance: Improves data security and compliance through access control and monitoring.
* Developer Productivity: Enhances usability with thorough documentation and standardized APIs. API versioning facilitates easy transitions during upgrades.
* Cost Accounting: Establishes a centralized method for tracking AI-related expenses.

## Summary

**Planning Logic:** We structured the implementation goals into user stories for capabilities that directly deliver value to stakeholders (developers, operators, security, finance) and system requirements for underlying technical qualities (scalability, reliability, AI integration). Key foundational features – *standardized API access, documentation, security, monitoring, and cost tracking* – are addressed first as **basic complexity** items, aligning with top priorities (observability, access control, cost accounting). Advanced enhancements like *dynamic scaling, self-healing, and AI agent integration (MCP)* are included as **advanced** items to future-proof the platform once basics are in place. Each story or requirement is crafted to be testable and tied to the expected benefit (e.g., standardization reduces redundancy, monitoring improves performance management, etc.), ensuring traceability to stakeholder needs. We incorporated Azure APIM’s built-in capabilities (developer portal, policies for security, token metrics, etc.) to reduce implementation risk and cited current Azure features (like token-based metrics and MCP support) to validate our approach with state-of-the-art practices.

**TL;DR (for non-technical stakeholders):** We will build a robust API gateway for all our AI services that *standardizes how developers access AI*, *secures who can use what*, *monitors usage and performance*, and *tracks costs per team*. For example, instead of every team doing one-off AI integrations, everyone will go through a single portal with documented APIs and secure keys. We’ll be able to see how the AI is used (and by whom), control and allocate costs, and smoothly scale up as more people use it. Over time, we’ll add smart features like auto-scaling, automatic failovers (so there’s no downtime if something breaks), and even direct integration for AI assistants (so tools like Copilot could trigger our APIs safely). This plan ensures our AI capabilities are delivered in a consistent, secure, and efficient manner, aligning with both immediate needs and future growth.

## High Level Requirements

To meet the high-level needs, key concepts, and expected benefits of a standardized AI access platform, we outline user-centric **User Stories** and technical **Requirements** for an Azure API Management implementation (with AI gateway and Model Context Protocol add-ons). These cover **Observability**, **Access Control**, and **Cost Accounting** as top priorities, along with standardization, performance, security, and continuous improvement goals.

### Standardized & Unified AI Access (User Story)

**User Story:** *As an application developer on a product team, I want to access various AI models and capabilities through a single, well-documented API gateway, so that I can integrate AI features consistently without needing ad-hoc connectors or specialized knowledge for each model.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Standard API Interface for Multiple AI Services:** Given multiple AI services (e.g. NLP, vision, OpenAI) are exposed via the API platform with a unified schema, When I invoke an AI function (such as a text analysis or image recognition) through the standardized REST API, Then the request and response formats are consistent and documented across all AI services, And new AI services can be invoked in the same uniform manner without custom integration effort.

**Verification Method:** *Demonstration* – Show through a demo that calling different AI model endpoints (previously accessed ad-hoc) via the unified API yields results with a consistent format and behavior.

**Validation Method:** *Field Trials / Pilots* – Pilot the unified API with internal developers on a small project to confirm that they can integrate multiple AI services successfully without additional help, demonstrating improved development speed and reduced errors.

**Confidence Score:** 5 (High) – The scope and benefits are clear and directly aligned with the project’s standardization goals, making it straightforward to implement and validate.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Establishing a unified API interface is fundamental to the platform’s foundation and uses well-understood REST API principles.

### Developer Documentation & Portal (User Story)

**User Story:** *As a developer (internal or partner), I want a comprehensive API developer portal with up-to-date documentation, code examples, and testing tools, so that I can quickly learn how to use the AI APIs and integrate them into my applications with minimal friction.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Self-Service Access to API Documentation:** Given an authorized developer has access to the API Management developer portal, When they navigate to the AI services section, Then they can view clear documentation for each AI API (endpoints, request/response schemas, example usages, and error codes), And they can use an interactive console or “Try it out” feature to execute sample AI API calls with their credentials.

**Verification Method:** *Inspection* – Manually review the developer portal pages to ensure all AI APIs are documented and that each page meets documentation standards (including examples and tutorials).

**Validation Method:** *Stakeholder Review / Walkthroughs* – Conduct walkthroughs with a few internal and MSP developers, ensuring they can find the information they need and successfully invoke an AI API using only the portal’s documentation and tools.

**Confidence Score:** 5 (High) – Azure API Management provides an out-of-box developer portal, so we are confident that we can populate it with the required content and meet developer needs.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Providing documentation is a fundamental requirement using standard tooling (the APIM developer portal), though it requires careful content creation.

### API Versioning & Backward Compatibility (User Story)

**User Story:** *As an application developer using the AI APIs, I want versioned API endpoints and a commitment to backward compatibility, so that updates or improvements to AI services do not break my existing applications and I can adopt new features at my own pace.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Non-Disruptive API Upgrade:** Given the AI API platform has introduced a new version of an AI service (e.g., v2 with an improved model), When a client application continues calling the older version endpoint (v1) without changes, Then the v1 API continues to function as before (no breaking changes), And when the client is ready to upgrade, switching to the v2 endpoint yields the new capabilities while both versions remain available in parallel.

**Verification Method:** *Test* – Perform regression testing by running a suite of calls against an older API version after deploying a new version to ensure responses are unchanged. Additionally, test that calls to the new version produce expected new outputs, confirming both versions operate concurrently.

**Validation Method:** *Simulations and Emulation* – Simulate a scenario where multiple teams use different versions of the API (one uses v1, another uses v2). Monitor in a staging environment that both sets of applications work correctly, validating that teams can upgrade when ready without disruption.

**Confidence Score:** 5 (High) – Versioning is a well-understood practice and Azure APIM natively supports publishing multiple versions of an API, so we are confident in meeting this requirement.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Managing API versions is straightforward with established patterns, though it introduces ongoing maintenance to support deprecated versions as needed.

### Secure Access Control & Authentication (User Story)

**User Story:** *As an API platform security administrator, I want fine-grained access control for AI APIs (using API keys, OAuth2/JWT, and role-based permissions), so that internal developers and partner (MSP) developers only access authorized services, ensuring sensitive AI capabilities are protected from unauthorized use.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Enforcing Authenticated Access:** Given an API consumer has a valid subscription key or OAuth token with the appropriate role, When they call an AI API endpoint, Then the request is authenticated and authorized, allowing access to the service. And Given a request without valid credentials (or with insufficient permissions), When it calls an AI endpoint, Then API Management blocks the call with an HTTP 401/403 error, and no data is processed by the backend. (For example, internal-only APIs require an internal developer’s credentials and reject calls from external MSP developers.)

**Verification Method:** *Test* – Configure two test callers (one authorized, one not authorized) and execute calls to various AI APIs. Verify through automated tests that authorized calls succeed with 200 OK and unauthorized calls are rejected with proper error codes, as per policy.

**Validation Method:** *Operational Testing* – In a staging environment, have internal and external developers attempt to use the platform with their respective credentials. Validate that each can only access the APIs intended for them (e.g., MSP developers cannot access internal-only endpoints), confirming the access control rules meet organizational policies.

**Confidence Score:** 5 (High) – Azure APIM provides built-in support for subscription keys and JWT validation policies, so we are confident that robust access control can be achieved as specified.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Authentication and authorization are fundamental capabilities; configuring them in APIM is straightforward (though critical), leveraging standard security features.

### Observability & Monitoring (User Story)

**User Story:** *As a platform SRE/operations engineer, I want comprehensive observability for the AI API platform – including real-time metrics, logs, and distributed tracing of requests – so that I can monitor performance, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues proactively to ensure reliability and optimal performance.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts:** Given the AI API Management platform is handling requests in production, When I view the monitoring dashboard (or Azure Monitor/App Insights logs) for the platform, Then I can see key metrics in real-time such as request rates, response times, and error counts for each AI API. And when an error rate exceeds a defined threshold or an AI service call fails, Then an alert is triggered to the on-call engineer with details (via email or Teams), And correlation IDs or distributed trace information are available in the logs to follow a specific request through the system for debugging.

**Verification Method:** *Demonstration* – Configure a test scenario where the system processes sample requests (including some failing ones) and demonstrate in the monitoring tools that the corresponding metrics are recorded and an alert is raised for the failure. For example, show the log entry and trace for a request that times out and the notification that was sent.

**Validation Method:** *Operational Testing* – Run a load test or pilot in a production-like environment while the ops team monitors the system. Validate that the team can observe the system’s health (e.g., see throughput, latency graphs) and respond to any issues detected (e.g., they receive and act on an alert for high error rate), confirming the observability meets real operational needs.

**Confidence Score:** 5 (High) – Azure API Management and Azure Monitor provide robust, standard ways to capture API metrics and traces, so we are confident in achieving full observability as described.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Enabling and using observability features is straightforward with cloud-native tooling, though it’s an essential operations capability that must be tuned over time.

### Performance Scalability (Requirement)

**Requirement:** *The AI API Management platform **shall** scale dynamically to handle increasing load on AI services while maintaining performance, by supporting auto-scaling of API gateway units and backend resources and implementing load balancing and throttling policies under peak conditions.*

* **Rationale:** This ensures **performance & scalability** – the system can grow with organizational needs and maintain low response times as usage increases. For example, APIM’s backend load balancing and token throttling features will be used to distribute load and prevent any single client from exhausting resources.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Verification Method:** *Test* – Conduct load testing where traffic is gradually increased beyond normal levels and verify that additional APIM instances or backend instances are automatically brought online (or a scale-out occurs) and that response times remain within acceptable limits. Confirm through metrics that no requests are dropped or significantly delayed, and throttling kicks in only when defined limits per client are exceeded.

* **Validation Method:** *Simulations and Emulation* – Use a high-fidelity simulation of peak load (for example, modeling a spike in requests from multiple applications) in a staging environment. Validate that the system’s throughput scales out as expected and that end-users (developers or applications) experience consistent performance, confirming the system would handle real-world traffic surges.

* **Verification/Validation Note:** We will also leverage APIM’s new AI gateway policies like *token limit* (TPM rate limiting per consumer) to ensure one app cannot starve others, and *backend load balancing* to distribute traffic across AI model instances. These will be verified via configuration review and test (e.g., one client hitting limit gets 429 responses while others continue smoothly).

* **Verification Methodology:** *Automated Verification* – Use scripts and monitoring tools to automatically scale load and verify system scaling (e.g., using Azure Load Testing and checking autoscale logs).

* **Validation Methodology:** *Operational Testing* – Perform live tests in a controlled production scenario (or pilot phase) to validate that scaling meets actual user demand and performance SLAs in operation.

**Complexity:** *Advanced* – Implementing dynamic scaling involves cloud configuration and careful tuning (scale criteria, concurrency limits), but it is supported by Azure services (e.g., auto-scale rules for APIM and Azure Functions) making it feasible.

### Reliability & Self-Healing (Requirement)

**Requirement:** *The AI API platform **shall** provide high reliability with self-healing capabilities – for example, by implementing automatic retries, circuit breakers, and failover for AI service calls – such that transient failures or unresponsive AI model instances are handled gracefully without manual intervention.*

* **Rationale:** This addresses **reliability** and **continuous availability**. In practice, the APIM gateway will utilize policies like the *circuit breaker* to stop sending requests to a failing backend instance and *retry-after* handling for dynamic recovery. If one AI service instance or integration fails, the system should route to a healthy instance or retry after a short delay, ensuring clients experience minimal disruption.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Verification Method:** *Analysis* – Use fault injection testing or a simulation model to analyze system behavior during failures. For example, deliberately make one backend AI service unresponsive and verify (via logs and outcomes) that the circuit breaker opens and traffic is rerouted to an alternate instance or queued/retried after a delay. Analyze that error rates presented to the client are within acceptable limits (e.g., the system retries and succeeds on a second attempt).

* **Validation Method:** *Field Trials / Pilots* – During a pilot deployment, monitor the system’s behavior through real usage while intentionally taking one instance down (or causing a known failure). Observe that the users of the AI API either do not notice any downtime or see rapid recovery (perhaps a slightly slower response rather than an error). Gather user feedback to confirm that the API service is perceived as reliable even during incidents.

* **Verification/Validation Note:** We will configure APIM backend *circuit breaker rules* and use multiple instances of AI services behind a load balancer, so that if one fails, others continue serving. The success criteria is that the system automatically handles a single point failure without requiring a hotfix or manual restart.

* **Complexity:** *Advanced* – Self-healing involves complex scenarios and requires robust error-handling logic and thorough testing, but it significantly improves system resilience and reduces on-call burdens.

### Cost Accounting & Usage Analytics (User Story)

**User Story:** *As a finance/operations manager, I want detailed usage analytics and cost reports for the AI APIs – broken down by team, application, or developer – so that I can accurately allocate AI service costs to the correct departments (chargeback) and manage the budget for AI resources across the organization.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Usage Reporting for Chargeback:** Given the API platform is logging consumption metrics for each AI API call by consumer, When a monthly cost report is generated, Then it includes the number of requests or tokens used per department/application and the corresponding cost (using internal rate cards or Azure billing data), And stakeholders can see, for example, that Team A used 50k tokens of the OpenAI API and Team B used 30k, enabling internal chargeback of costs. Additionally, real-time dashboards show usage trends per team throughout the month.

**Verification Method:** *Analysis* – Review the analytics data collected (e.g., Application Insights or API Management’s reports) to ensure that it captures all needed dimensions (team, app, API, token count). Verify the calculations in a sample cost report for correctness (e.g., cross-check that if 1,000 calls were made at a known unit cost, the reported cost matches). If needed, simulate usage with known values to see if the system’s reporting matches expected totals.

**Validation Method:** *Stakeholder Review / Walkthroughs* – Present the generated usage and cost reports to finance and department leads for a past period (e.g., last week’s pilot usage). Walk through the numbers with them to ensure the format is useful and the data is credible. Confirm that they can use this information to make decisions (e.g., adjusting budgets or limiting usage if needed), thereby validating that the cost accounting meets their needs.

**Confidence Score:** 4 (Moderate) – While capturing usage metrics is straightforward with APIM (which can emit token metrics to App Insights for chargeback), aligning the data with internal billing (e.g., incorporating Azure costs and organizational structure) may require some custom integration, but we have a clear path to achieve it.

**Complexity:** *Basic* – Collecting and reporting usage data uses standard features (analytics, logs, metrics) but must be carefully configured; the concept is well-understood, making it a fundamental capability to implement early.

### AI Agent Integration via MCP (Requirement)

**Requirement:** *The platform **shall** implement support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing AI agents (such as Azure OpenAI, Copilot for Web, Copilot for M365, GitHub Copilot, and other LLM-based agents) to discover and invoke the exposed APIs as “tools” in a standardized way. This includes hosting or proxying MCP servers through APIM and applying governance (security, monitoring) to them.*

* **Rationale:** This fulfills the **advanced AI integration** goal – enabling dynamic AI agent workflows. By conforming to MCP (an open standard for connecting AI models to tools/APIs), our AI services can be directly used by AI agents in a consistent manner, vastly improving how AI-driven automation can interact with enterprise systems. For example, an AI agent could use an APIM-exposed MCP tool to pull data or trigger an action securely, with APIM managing authentication and logging for those calls.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Verification Method:** *Demonstration* – Set up a sample AI agent (e.g., GitHub Copilot in VS Code or an Azure OpenAI function) connected to an MCP server exposed via APIM. Demonstrate the agent successfully performing a task that involves calling our API (for instance, retrieving information via an MCP tool API and posting an update). Verify that APIM policies (like authentication via credential manager and subscription keys) are enforced during this agent->API interaction.

* **Validation Method:** *Prototyping* – Develop a prototype integration where a real stakeholder (e.g., a developer using Copilot or a chatbot) utilizes the MCP-enabled API to accomplish a real-world task (such as automating an issue triage across two systems as in Microsoft’s example). Gather feedback on whether the AI agent integration works reliably and securely in practice.

* **Additional Considerations:** Azure APIM’s credential manager will be used to securely handle any OAuth credentials needed for the MCP scenarios. Success is measured by the AI agent’s ability to invoke our APIs autonomously and the platform’s ability to govern those calls (logging, auth) just like any other client.

* **Complexity:** *Advanced* – MCP support is a cutting-edge capability requiring alignment with an evolving standard and careful security handling, but it positions our platform to leverage AI Agents and future “tools” integration, which is a strategic advantage.

### Platform Extensibility & Continuous Improvement (User Story)

**User Story:** *As the AI API platform owner, I want the platform to be easily extensible and continuously improved – allowing quick onboarding of new AI services or enhancements based on developer feedback – so that the platform stays relevant, optimally tuned, and aligned with the evolving needs of product teams.*

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Scenario: Onboard New AI Service with Minimal Effort:** Given a new AI service or model (for example, a new recommendation engine) becomes available, When the platform team decides to expose it, Then they can add it to Azure APIM within one development cycle by importing its API definition or wrapping it with a standard interface, applying the common security and monitoring policies, And product team developers can start using it through the same portal and keys as other AI APIs.

* **Scenario: Incorporate Developer Feedback:** Given developers provide feedback or requests (e.g., via the portal or sprint reviews) about the AI APIs (such as adjusting rate limits or adding new endpoints), When the platform team evaluates this feedback, Then actionable improvements (like increased quota, better examples in docs, or a new API feature) are added to the backlog and delivered in subsequent iterations, And a notification or changelog is provided to the developers so they know their input led to an improvement.

**Verification Method:** *Inspection* – Verify that the process for adding a new API is documented (e.g., a runbook for importing an API spec, applying standard policies) and perhaps simulate this process with a minor service to ensure it can be done quickly. Also inspect the feedback logs/tickets to confirm there’s a system to capture and track developer suggestions.

**Validation Method:** *Stakeholder Review / Walkthroughs* – Conduct a review with product team developers after a cycle of improvements. For extensibility, walk through how a new API was added (or do a live demo of adding one) to confirm it meets their needs for future capabilities. For feedback, review a couple of recent changes that came from developer input and get confirmation from those developers that their issue was resolved satisfactorily, validating that the loop is effective.

**Confidence Score:** 4 (Moderate) – We have high confidence in APIM’s capability to onboard APIs quickly (it can auto-import OpenAPI definitions and set up auth for Azure services). The uncertainty lies more in gathering and prioritizing feedback, which depends on active engagement with developer teams, but processes can be put in place for that.

**Complexity:** *Advanced* – While adding single services is straightforward, maintaining an **extensible, adaptive** platform involves governance and prioritization. This is an ongoing, iterative aspect of the platform that requires coordination beyond pure technical work (hence more complex in the long term).
