	    "New_Description": "Androids are artificial lifeforms that have been designed to appear human, and are often mistaken for such upon casual observation. Androids were considered primitive and antiquated by the super-science metrics of the Ancient Ones, as their primary utility had been largely superseded by the use of soft-light and hard-light holograms. Still, there were times and places where economics favored the use of the ever-sturdy android. Thus, many were still in use at the time of the Great Disaster.  They are especially prevalent in areas where holograms can not be deployed. All androids have a limited amount of memory storage space, so they can effectively be taught in only one field of endeavour. They have been made sensitive to certain sonics frequencies so that they are easily damaged by them. They are powered by energy from energy cells.  The usefulness of this of creation is obvious. They can be made to have great strength; can be made to be very small and thus fit in places an engineering robot cannot enter. They can be made radiation resistant so that they can operate in areas where even a man in a suit would be in danger for any length of time. The medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for 24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks. Lack of energy after 24 hours will cause the android to hibernate until energy is restored.",
	    "Combat": "Thinker Androids are artificial life forms that are given the task of doing research and science.  Their focus is on anything that require a lot of thought and planning.  They are not equipped to deal with combat and will defer to Warriors and Workers first in the event of combat.  Thinkers are equipped with additional memory cells that allow them to record and capture the memories of the other Androids under their command.  In the event of danger, they will attempt to get back to the humans or computers that dispatched them on their mission if things go wrong.

Blights, Bloodbirds and Carrins hunt these young Attercops, liking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselves.  The Attercop's dale resistant web sometimes stretches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in the web need to make a DC 5 strength check to escape.  Any loot found in an Attercop's web is merely indigestible waste to the spider.  The Lil, commonly take refuge within or behind Attercop webs, although some fall prey to the spider. Behavior:Auto Machines are equipped with 1 to 12 robot limbs or 3-meter long tentacles, especially adapted to their assigned tasks.  They may also be equipped with one of the following:  Rivet gun (Slug Thrower B), welding roches, pain spray, heat lamps (treat as laser pistol for damage), metal punch (treat as knives), wire binders, or water jets and brushes."

They feed on bone marrow and will rip through anything, even duralloy, to get at fresh bones.Combat: Cal then are predators that attack nearly any creature smaller than them (including humanoids). They often swoop down to attack, remaining on the ground while they fight. They attack with their mandibles and only retreat when they are badly wounded.Society: Cal then tend to be solidary creatures, claiming a particular area as their hunting ground. Their diet consists primarily of the bones of their prey, and they're known for tearing off flesh and discarding it to crush and devour the bones. Their method of feeding tends to attract scavengers and other creatures to a cal then's hunting ground to feed on the leftovers. They are sometimes encountered in mated pairs, but mate only briefly. The female lays a clutch of eggs, but does not care for the young."

Centisteeds are usually colored in blotches, much like a \"painted\" horse. Their heads are horse-shaped, but they have two compound insect eyes, giving them 360' vision. Small mandibles fill their mouth instead of teeth.",
	    "Combat": "Cemisteeds do not initiate combat at any time. They panic with the tiniest of provocation, perceiving everything as a threat to their meager lives. Unfortunately, the centisteed tends to trample any character or creature in its way. A successful attack means that the opponent has been knocked down and trampled with ld8 hooves. Each hoof does ld6 points of damage.   When the centisteed perceives danger, it immediately activates its force field generation to ward off any possible damage. If a rider is currently on the beast, the force field actually raises the character off the beast's back, causing him to fall to the ground. Centisteeds have been known to trample each other in their panic to follow another centisteed on the run. Once they get going, they are almost impossible to catch.",
	    "Society": "Centisteeds have no society other than herd instinct. A centisteed can carry two human-sized passengers, or one passenger and 100 kilograms of cargo. One rider must concentrate at all times on controlling the beast, or it tries to throw and then trample the passengers. No amount of coaxing and kind words can calm these hyperactive creatures. To add insult to injury, they eat twice as much as a normal animal their size. Herds of centisceeds can overgraze a pasture or meadow in record time. The Ranks of the Fit are rumored to have a centisteed cavalry with riders that use mental mutations to keep the beasts in check.Centisteeds spend the majority of their time grazing to support their hyperactive metabolisms and great body mass. Whenever they're not engaged in other activity, they're usually eating. They prefer grains but also eat fruit and roughage. A centisteed herd is led by a stallion (or \"king\"), attended by several lesser males and a harem of females. Domesticated centisteeds are used as mounts and beasts of burden, although they don't serve well as draft animals.",

While in their standard form, fens wear fish in armor, giving them the AC bonus of studded leather ( + 3 AC). Fens can shapechange into a bird of their own size and weight twice per day. This allows them to escape both aquatic and land based predators with ease. While in their bird form, fens can only fly at a movement rate of 24.

They have many human elements, including human-like hands on their wings and legs. These creatures usually wear clothing of some sort, and all wear at least a harness for weapons and equipment. The feathers of a Hawkoid are predominantly brown, though they have white markings. Male hawkoids have beautiful white crescents on the undersides of their wings.

Hawkoids almost always attack first by swooping silently down upon their prey, attempting to get in one surprise attack. After that, they will usually stay in melee range of a chosen victim, fighting until one or the other is dead. If hard pressed, or if a group of prey seemingly has a powerful guardian, hawkoids will use their fear generation to drive the biggest threat away. Though largely fearless, they are not stupid, and will retreat if their lives are threatened. Hawkoids generally have their repulsion fields to protect them when they decide to retreat with any victims they have slain.",

Hawkoids seldom land, preferring to levitate even when fighting or talking.

	    "New_Description": "These abysmally stupid animals look like giant rabbits and stand 3 meters at the shoulder. Hoppers have a large rack of antlers, though some have simple curved horns instead. A jackalope's natural coloring is usually brown with a white underbelly. Some pure white specimens have been seen, and green, blue, and pink individuals have been reported. Because of its chameleon power, a hopper can appear any color, and pastel-colored individuals are thought to be the results of the use of this ability.",
	    "Combat": "Jackalopes are easily spooked unless they have been trained. A wild jackalope will attack anything which startles it, leaping at the offensive being (or object) and attempting to skewer it. A hopper will attack until it is hurt or otherwise frightened, such as by a loud noise or bright light. Once it has been frightened, a jackalope will hop away, often pausing after only one or two leaps, hunkering down and using its chameleon powN m11rntion to blend in with its surroundings. After blending in, the hopper tries to remain still until it believes that the source of the danger has left. Wild hoppers are placid creatures that prefer to flee from danger as rapidly as they can. Domesticated hoppers can be trained not to flee from things like combat, but may require Animal Handling skills checks to keep under control. Hoppers are capable of delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs when threatened, although they only do so when cornered (or specially trained). Riding hoppers requires a special saddle and harness, since their normal gait consists of short hippity-hops and their full out run consists of great leaps interspersed between smaller hops. Failing an Animal Handling (riding) skill check while on a hopper usually means being thrown from the saddle.",
	    "Society": "Hoppers live in small family herds. A typical herd will consist of half adults and half young. If approached carefully, young jackalopes can be captured and trained. They will respond to only one master, and will still be easily spooked, though the presence of its master will raise a hopper's morale to 12. Jackalopes have very rough gaits, and a first-time rider is 80% likely to fall off and take 1d6 damage. A trained jackalope can carry one man-sized rider. A hopper with a rider can leap 10 meters, while an unencumbered hopper can leap as far as 15 meters.Hoppers are found in small herds on the plains and grasslands of Gamma Terra. Many cultures have domesticated hoppers as riding animals and (sometimes) beasts of burden, although they're not capable of carrying very heavy loads. Hopper meat is also a staple of many cultures' diets, and their fur makes soft clothes and blankets.",

The typical jaget is about a meter and a half long and weighs about 50 kilograms. A jaget's coat is stippled with dark stripes or spots over a yellowish base.

A single human-sized opponent may be attacked by a lone jaget, but the savannah cats generally pursue smaller and safer game. Jagets attack with two claws and a bite. If hunung together, the cats will often use their fear generation ability to drive prey towards the waiting pride. Jagets will attempt to use their intuition abilities in combat, gaining a + 2 THAC with a successful MP roll.",

Their telepathic and intuitive abilities make it nearly impossible to surprise a group of cats, and also make the jagets skilled stalkers. Rarely, savannah cats are found wandering alone far from their homelands as the compan10ns of other creatures. Usually this is because, due to their substantial mental powers, jagets are often desired as followers or hirelings of other species.

(The GM will need to remember to add to the XP Value for an orlen based on what artifacts it is carrying.)  Orlens prefer not to resolve problems by combat, but their size, strength, and armament ensure that they will not be caught unprepared when trouble comes looking for them. All orlens have a dual name, one for the left head and one for the right, such as Jan-Jane, Maura-Maureen, Tim-Tom, and KevinCalvin. When an orlen talks, the heads alternate speaking.",

Small groups of parn (as many as four) can bring down much larger creatures. They attack with their antennae and fight to the death, never retreating.Society:  Parn tend to be solitary creatures. They mate only once per year, and the female lays her eggs in a buried nest before abandoning them to their fate. Most young parn don't survive the first few months of life. Those that do grow to maturity within a year."

	    "New_Description": "The horse cacti is both a horse and cactus in name only. It is in actually a mobile cactus-like plant with behaviors in many ways resembling a horse. The plant has a large, horizontal central trunk which is supported by either four or six thick, stubby stalks which act as legs. These legs can propel the creature at great speeds. When the creature moves as quickly as it can, the action of the legs resembles a horse galloping.  The trunk extends into a thick, neck-like growth which the plant keeps elevated. At the end of the \"neck\" is a large assortment of leaves, roots and a clump of visual and olfactory organs. The leaves are used to gather sunlight, and the roots absorb liquids. The plant lowers its leaves and roots into pools of water when it drinks, an action that further resembles horse activity.  The pineto is much more cactus than horse. Every centimeter of its surface except for the leaves and roots is covered with long, sharp thorns. These thorns are usually 5 centimeters or so in length Althcmgh sharp, they are somewhat flexible. These thorns give a pineto the appearance of having a hairy \"coat\" of thorns. The pinetos can be ridden, but a saddle of thick leather or other strong material is required.",
	    "Combat": "Opposite the neck growth is another growth that tapers to a relatively thin stalk that is covered in sharp spines that lay close to its body. This \"tail\" is flexible, and the plant can use it to attack.  It lashes out with its \"tail\" as a means of defense, but prefers to run away from attackers as quickly as possible.",

Pinetos are extremely skittish and will bolt as soon as they perceive a threat. Only one of a pack has to become aware of the threat for everyone else to run.

Seps can sense motion and sound up to 60 meters away.Combat: Seps can sense vibrations on the surface up to 50 meters way and usually spring suddenly from the snow and ice to bite prey their their powerful jaws. They can just as quickly dive back below the surface, circling around for another attack from a different direction. Once killed, the prey is dragged below-ground and eaten.Society: Seps tend to hunt singly, although they're sometimes encountered in small \"schools\" of up to six. They inhabit deserts and other sandy regions."

Although vicious and quite capable of causing serious harm, Squeekers have never been known for their courage.  When hunting, they single out weak or isolated targets that can easily be pulled down. Their most common hunting tactic is to stealthily surround the victim and then rush out all at once, directing their sonic  blast attacks at the target.  If the civtim is still standing, they then attack with their bite, clinging to the animal until it is pulled down by the weight of their numbers.  If their dinner puts up strong resistance, they will circle it at a safe sitance, hoping to wear the target down by repeasted lunges.  If this does not work or help arrives, the Squeekers flee in all directions.",

They prey on passerby or scavenger food from the waste of others.  Their dens are usually a small complex of underground tunnels with several shambers and exists.  Squeekers can be domesticated somewhat and trained to severlike guard dogs and hunting animals.  This requires that they be trained from birth and even then can only be accomplished by those immune to their sonic blast mutation.  Hissers, in particular, keep pens of the animals for use both in the hunt and as food.  Indeed it is likely that the hisser immunity to sonic blasts developed slowly from a close relationship Squeekers.",

In general, it ignores people unless they present the appropriate ID cards.  When on an assult mission, the warbot shoots firrst and examines ID cards later.  In the event of an attack upon tis base or upon itself, the warbot will fully activate and do whatever is necessary to drive off or destroy the attacker.

Attercops keep their prey as long as four days before they settle down to feed.  Because of the creatures extraordinarily high Mental strength, the Attercop is completely immune to all mental attacks except illusions.  These mental attacks always succeed.  The Attercop is a solitary hunter, allowing no others of its kind within its web or territory except during fall breeding, Female Attercops deposit a half-meter diameter egg sac containing over 1000 young.  Blights, Bloodbirds and Carrins hunt these young Attercops, liking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselves.  The Attercop's dale resistant web sometimes stretches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in the web need to make a DC 5 strength check to escape.  Any loot found in an Attercop's web is merely indigestible waste to the spider.  The Lil, commonly take refuge within or behind Attercop webs, although some fall prey to the spider.",

The robot is required to respond to a civil authority card, which can make it stop rendering aid or direct it to a new quadrant.  Secity cards are obeyed even if the orders endanger property and human life.",

It then determines the most effective course of action to save the most lives.  Only after all lives are accounted for willit concern itself with preventing property damage.  Each person located is placed on the robot's upper surface and weak force field encloses them.  Fresh air is pumped in and emergency medical treatment is rendered if necessary.  The robot carries each reduced individual to safety and then gives and gets the next one.  Medical care is not given once the victim is safe from the disaster scene.  The robot will politely, but forcefully, remove looters or other dangerous individuals from the scene, using a stun ray or screamer.",

	    "Description": "The aero squid is an amphibious predator, equally formidable in or out of water. Its telekinetic flight ability is constant: it essentially swims through water and air with ease. An aero squid does not need to return to the water except to mate, so it may be encountered over all sorts of terrain in all climates but the coldest, as well as in the ocean depths. It has no need to sleep, although it will rest after a large meal. The small and completely aquatic infant form of the aero squid is exceedingly vulnerable, so the adults are happily rare. A hungry aero squid is an eating machine that will devour any form of animal life it can get its tentacles on.",
	    "Equipment": "",
	    "Reactions": "",
	    "Behavior": "Two of its tentacles are very long and end in horny, paddle-shaped appendages 3 m in diameter. The others are shorter and lined with suction cups. The aero squid will bat at creatures on the ground or in the air with the two longer tentacles while it grabs other creatures with the other eight. It can use only one tentacle per man-sized opponent, but all such targets are considered AC 10 (dexterity and size modifiers apply, how- ever). Construction damage does not begin until the action turn after a successful grab, and then only affects creatures not in plastic or metal armor or a total carapace.Two action turns after the first successful grab, it will pull one victim (at random) to its mouth for a bite (at + 4 to hit). It will continue to bite one victim until damage equals double the victim's hit-point total (i.e., the victim is dead and devoured). After that, it will bite another victim, if it has grabbed more than one. Construction damage to a victim does not continue while the aero- squid is trying to bite that victim. Creatures weighing 800 kg or more can try to break free of a constricting tentacle by rolling their combined strength and dexterity or less on a doubled percentile. roll. Each character may try this only twice (one attempt per action turn).The aero squid is a mollusk and has no brain as such, so it is immune to empathy, telepathy, mental control, beguiling, confusion, mental blast, and mental paralysis. On the other hand, it is stupid, so it can often be avoided by rudimentary camouflage or even simple immobility (80% and 30% chance respectively, modified by circumstances as the GM sees fit). It will also attack things it can- not eat, such as robots, androids, borgs, and vehicles in motion. To hold such an opponent requires one constricting tentacle per 50 kph maximum speed of the machine. The aero squid will in any case throw away any machine (including a closed vehicle containing living organisms) after one bite.Due to its size, an aero squid surprises only on a 1, but it can only be surprised by flying creatures (or swimming creatures in the water). Such creatures will surprise on a 1-3, since the aero squid's only functional sense is sight.",

Its telekinetic flight ability is constant: it essentially swims through water and air with ease. An aero squid does not need to return to the water except to mate, so it may be encountered over all sorts of terrain in all climates but the coldest, as well as in the ocean depths. It has no need to sleep, although it will rest after a large meal. The small and completely aquatic infant form of the aero squid is exceedingly vulnerable, so the adults are happily rare. A hungry aero squid is an eating machine that will devour any form of animal life it can get its tentacles on. Behavior:Two of its tentacles are very long and end in horny, paddle-shaped appendages 3 m in diameter. The others are shorter and lined with suction cups. The aero squid will bat at creatures on the ground or in the air with the two longer tentacles while it grabs other creatures with the other eight. It can use only one tentacle per man-sized opponent, but all such targets are considered AC 10 (dexterity and size modifiers apply, how- ever). Construction damage does not begin until the action turn after a successful grab, and then only affects creatures not in plastic or metal armor or a total carapace.Two action turns after the first successful grab, it will pull one victim (at random) to its mouth for a bite (at + 4 to hit). It will continue to bite one victim until damage equals double the victim's hit-point total (i.e., the victim is dead and devoured). After that, it will bite another victim, if it has grabbed more than one. Construction damage to a victim does not continue while the aero- squid is trying to bite that victim. Creatures weighing 800 kg or more can try to break free of a constricting tentacle by rolling their combined strength and dexterity or less on a doubled percentile. roll. Each character may try this only twice (one attempt per action turn).The aero squid is a mollusk and has no brain as such, so it is immune to empathy, telepathy, mental control, beguiling, confusion, mental blast, and mental paralysis. On the other hand, it is stupid, so it can often be avoided by rudimentary camouflage or even simple immobility (80% and 30% chance respectively, modified by circumstances as the GM sees fit). It will also attack things it can- not eat, such as robots, androids, borgs, and vehicles in motion. To hold such an opponent requires one constricting tentacle per 50 kph maximum speed of the machine. The aero squid will in any case throw away any machine (including a closed vehicle containing living organisms) after one bite.Due to its size, an aero squid surprises only on a 1, but it can only be surprised by flying creatures (or swimming creatures in the water). Such creatures will surprise on a 1-3, since the aero squid's only functional sense is sight.",

(See A World Gone Mad, DRAGONissue #86, and A Field Guide To Lunar Mutants,\" DRAGON issue #87.) One of the mutant plants now found at Tycho Center is the so-called blaster blossom, a mutant orchid.The blaster blossom is a reactive mutant, using its powers whenever it is touched. It has two attacks. The first is a spore cloud (treated as intensity 17 con- tact poison) that can slay victims with relative ease. This is fired whenever anything touches the blossom. The sec- ond attack is a actually a series of ran- dom energy attacks, fired whenever any metallic object (such as a robot) touches the plant. In a random manner, it will use one of the following attacks (roll1d4, one attack for one action turn):1) inflict 3d10 heat damage up to 3 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it; 2) fire an electrical bolt doing 2d26 damage up to 10 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it;3) fire an energy-draining bolt that instantly reduces all power cells within 5 m of the blossom to half energy; or,4) energy negation activated for 2-20 action turns, within a 15 m radius. If the spores ever kill the creature who touched the plant, they will grow in the dead body and become 1-3 new blaster blossoms within three days.",

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural ene- mies, and they are generally well- equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelli- gent creatures for a time. Crusteans appreciate company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves prop- erly. Even with long-time friends, a crus- tean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the oppo- nent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its symbiotic attach- ment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a physical strength of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum physical strength as noted above. This all assumes that the crus- tean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot  a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back. A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell(see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any verti- cal surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans light wave manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8-13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnera- ble while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water-breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and arti- facts, although they understand other creatures desire for them.

Their hands form part of their wings, so they cannot grasp an item and fly at the same time.At night dracs go in search of mamma- lian prey, locating it from the air and surrounding their victims with fog using weather manipulation. They will then use infravision to aim sonic blasts at their victims while staying out of reach. If cornered, they will use their fear generation talent to defend themselves. They will flee rather than fight, if at all possible. After a victim is dead or dis- abled, dracs will land and use their hollow fangs to draw all the blood from the bodies, draining 1d4 hit points per action turn from living victims until twice the number of hit points a victim possesses has been drained (leaving the victim dead and without any blood).It has been suspected that dracs were purposefully engineered by unknown beings, given their strong resemblance to the Ancients concept of vampires. Whether or not this is so remains to be seen. They do not appear to work for any higher power.Dracs will usually not carry any tools or equipment, though a rare one, usually the leader of a hunting pack, will have some equipment of Tech Level II. Dracs will only associate with their own kind. They will never become hirelings or followers.",

They inhabit ruins instead of populated cities because of their talent for turning popu- lated cities into deserted ruins. They are prolific and voracious, and there is vir- tually no way to remove them from any sort of building. Furthermore, they frequently (GMs option) carry terrible diseases similar to those used by plants with the bacterial symbiosis mutation. Encroaches are very fast for their size, but they are unintelligent and generally do not move more than a few meters in a straight line. It is their habit to spread their kind by hitching rides on more mobile creatures when the local popula- tion reaches saturation point or the food supply is exhausted (which is virtually always).Character parties will encounter encroaches in abandoned storerooms and kitchens. The little insects will pour out of cupboards and containers and try to crawl all over the party. They can be outrun by creatures faster than themsel- ves who are not surprised. Otherwise, nothing will prevent each and every character from being literally covered with encroaches. Encroaches are immune to all forms of electromagnetic,thermal and nuclear attack (and to poison as well); only direct kinetic force (squashing) will harm them. It is futileattack them en masse, since each one that is killed will be replaced tenfold. Slapping, picking off and stomping, rolling on the ground, and similar strate- gies will kill all but 1-10 per character. These will remain on a characters per- son or in his or her gear until they are brought to a new environment (which need not be too far away from the old environment) where there is food. Meanwhile, the encroaches will devour any carried food supplies that are not perfectly sealed.Any character who has housed encroaches for an hour or more will have 1-10 encroach eggs laid on his or her person, clothes, or gear. These eggs will hatch in two days, producing new encroaches ready to mate and start a new colony. The eggs will inevitably be in an inaccessible location (if that is in any way possible), but they can be killed with a fresher or energy bath, or disposed of by leaving the gear behind.Cities that have had experience with encroaches will ordinarily have devised horrible forms of execution specifically for any person or creature that infests the town with them.",

	    "Description": "There is a 20% chance that players have not encountered 1 tree, but 1d20 trees. The harmony tree is extremely handsome  graceful and straight, with large yellow flowers, red plumlike fruit, and lush, glossy green leaves the year around. Any creature with intelligence between 2 and 16 (not including robots or androids, but includ- ing cyborgs) that comes within 20 m of a harmony tree must defend vs. a mental attack or become psychologically depen- dent on the tree. Victims are overcome with a feeling of great peace and har- mony, and will be totally unwilling to leave the euphoric atmosphere of the tree or see it harmed in any way. Vic-ims must be killed, stunned, or other- wise subdued if they are to be removed from the trees influence. Once out of range, the victim will recover his or her normal senses. However, victims of a harmony tree are immune to fear gener- ation, mental control, and empathy while under the trees control.Creatures under a harmony trees control feel no need to eat, and they would shudder at the mere idea of hurt- ing any living thing, especially the tree itself. They will not even fight to defend themselves if attacked (but see below). However, if a victim is attacked and hurt, the tree must try to regain control (a mental attack at + 2); if the victim is brought to 10% of his or her hit points, the tree may attack again at no bonus. If this attempt to control the victim fails, the victim is free to escape.If anyone tries to harm the tree, all its victims will attack the offender in a frenzy of blind hatred, using the most effective available attack form at + 4 to hit. In this frenzy, victims will ignore damage to themselves, and can be injured and killed without the tree have- ing to renew its control over them at all. Victims of a harmony tree that are not attacked and killed will slowly, happily starve to death.A harmony tree will keep an entou- rage of as many creatures as possible, since this is its only means of defense. These creatures are often quite varied and even naturally hostile to each other, but they will lie down lovingly together at the base of the harmony tree (this being one way to identify the latter). If a victim is killed or starves to death, the tree will cause the survivors to hide the corpse by burying it or throwing it as far as possible, according to their abili- ties. However, it will have them keep any weapons on the body, as well as any weapons they have themselves, as the guardians may be called upon to use these in defense of the tree. Victims will hide weapons among the branches of the tree or play with them peacefully until someone attacks the tree. In gen- eral, the tree uses the senses of its vic- tims, but they are guided entirely by its intelligence, which may be higher or lower than their own.In any harmony tree encounter, the GM should decide what sort of entou- rage the tree should have, based on the size, status, and overall power of the player character party. There may be nothing but a few dead bodies under the tree, or up to a dozen assorted creatures including a few humans or humanoids with artifacts. Something should almost always be under a harmony tree, since no one can bury the last victims if they all die.The fruit of the harmony tree is inten- sity 7 slow poison. If the tree captures a victim too small to use in its defense (5 HD or less), it may force the victim to eat a fruit and then walk or fly away at normal speed to die within 1-3 hours, starting a new tree. Even after it leaves the 20 m range of the tree, the victim will not regain its senses unless it sur- vives the poisoning, being overcome with misery at having been cast out. This is the way in which the harmony tree propogates itself. A free-willed character that eats a ripe harmony fruit (indistinguishable from an unripe one) will gain four points of mental strength for one hour. Eating unripe harmony fruit will not increase a characters men- tal strength. At any given time, 10% of the fruit on a harmony tree will be ripe. All of it will be poisonous, and of course a character must survive the poison to gain the mental strength. The poisonous effects of all harmony fruit eaten in one day are cumulative, so two harmony fruit will act as intensity 14 poison.",

They will not even fight to defend themselves if attacked (but see below). However, if a victim is attacked and hurt, the tree must try to regain control (a mental attack at + 2); if the victim is brought to 10% of his or her hit points, the tree may attack again at no bonus. If this attempt to control the victim fails, the victim is free to escape.If anyone tries to harm the tree, all its victims will attack the offender in a frenzy of blind hatred, using the most effective available attack form at + 4 to hit. In this frenzy, victims will ignore damage to themselves, and can be injured and killed without the tree have- ing to renew its control over them at all. Victims of a harmony tree that are not attacked and killed will slowly, happily starve to death.A harmony tree will keep an entou- rage of as many creatures as possible, since this is its only means of defense. These creatures are often quite varied and even naturally hostile to each other, but they will lie down lovingly together at the base of the harmony tree (this being one way to identify the latter). If a victim is killed or starves to death, the tree will cause the survivors to hide the corpse by burying it or throwing it as far as possible, according to their abili- ties. However, it will have them keep any weapons on the body, as well as any weapons they have themselves, as the guardians may be called upon to use these in defense of the tree. Victims will hide weapons among the branches of the tree or play with them peacefully until someone attacks the tree. In gen- eral, the tree uses the senses of its vic- tims, but they are guided entirely by its intelligence, which may be higher or lower than their own.In any harmony tree encounter, the GM should decide what sort of entou- rage the tree should have, based on the size, status, and overall power of the player character party. There may be nothing but a few dead bodies under the tree, or up to a dozen assorted creatures including a few humans or humanoids with artifacts. Something should almost always be under a harmony tree, since no one can bury the last victims if they all die.The fruit of the harmony tree is inten- sity 7 slow poison. If the tree captures a victim too small to use in its defense (5 HD or less), it may force the victim to eat a fruit and then walk or fly away at normal speed to die within 1-3 hours, starting a new tree. Even after it leaves the 20 m range of the tree, the victim will not regain its senses unless it sur- vives the poisoning, being overcome with misery at having been cast out. This is the way in which the harmony tree propogates itself. A free-willed character that eats a ripe harmony fruit (indistinguishable from an unripe one) will gain four points of mental strength for one hour. Eating unripe harmony fruit will not increase a characters men- tal strength. At any given time, 10% of the fruit on a harmony tree will be ripe. All of it will be poisonous, and of course a character must survive the poison to gain the mental strength. The poisonous effects of all harmony fruit eaten in one day are cumulative, so two harmony fruit will act as intensity 14 poison."

The juggernaut is not a carnivore, but is still dangerous as it may charge if irritated by some move- ment within 100 m of its eyes (its effec- tive visual range). A juggernaut will attack first by charging, and then by standing and goring one or two oppo- nents. A charging juggernaut can cover an amazing distance in one action turn (60 m), and a standing juggernaut can gore twice in a round. However, its weak eyesight makes it -4 to hit at all times, although it has good senses of hearing and smell. An attacking jugger- naut will use its radiation eyes (intensity3d4) while goring if it is really angry (GMs option, based on the situation). One charge will often satisfy a jugger- naut, especially if its target falls down and plays dead. However, a wounded juggernaut will attack anything in range at random (including trees). Juggernauts are totally immune to poison and radia- tion.Though juggernauts are found only in North America, they were not originally native to this land.

	    "Description": "Marloks look like Pure Strain Humans, except for their extremely pale skin and their large, light-sensitive eyes, both of which are the result of their subterranean exist- ence. Why those humans who were the marloks ancestors went underground in the first place is not clear, though it is thought they might have been refugees from the devastation during the Social Wars, or even command personnel con- trolling the war from deep below the earth. No matter what their origins, marloks are one of the most successful of the various subterranean races and are widespread, often migrating from one underground complex to another by traveling at night on the surface.Marloks lead a nomadic life while underground, traveling various tunnels, caverns, and other passageways in small, close-knit groups. Because of the large number of subterranean preda- tors, they seldom stay in any one place for more than a few days. Marloks often use tunnels to the surface to send out nighttime foraging parties to collect whatever edible plants and animals they can get. These are used to supplement the usual marlok diet of roots and fungi. However, since marloks do not recog- nize the rights of surface people, they often are not above raiding a nearby village for foodstuffs, though some groups have been able to establish mutual trade arrangements in which the marloks receive food for metals and an occasional artifact or two.Marloks have developed several powers to aid in underground survival. Their directional sense helps individuals to find their way back to their clan if separated, and this ability also helps in navigating the maze of underground passageways. Heightened precision lets them test the stability of tunnels and caves before entering them. Their heightened hearing, besides detecting the approach of enemies, can also detect the sounds of settling and potential collapse in tunnel systems. Telekinesis is often used to move obstructions from their path; if objects do not prove easily movable, molecular disruption can usually reduce them to more manageable size. Should the exercise of the former two abilities be beyond the range of any one individual, then their mass mind can increase their power output. The marlok racial ability of mass mind is better than the type usually encoun- tered, in that the base chance of any of the participants dying is only 1% ( + 1% for each minute of contact). All involved in the mass mind share a weak tele- pathic link while in contact, between those in the link who are touching.",

	    "Description": "Sifoners are a special species of mutant lizard that feed off the mental energy given off by intelligent mammals, including Pure Strain Humans and humanoids. Mutant creatures will be attacked before unmutated ones, as they produce more mental energy from their mutations.A sifoner possesses hundreds of tiny suction cups on its feet which enable it to climb across walls, ceilings, and so forth without fear of falling. It has learned to position itself over well- traveled areas, blending in with the surrounding scenery to await a chance to jump on a passing victim. It will make four immediate attacks against a victim when it leaps (one for each clawed foot); if at least one of the attacks hits, the sifoner may activate its symbiotic attach- ment power. Any claw that hits need not roll to strike again, as it will be securely fastened to the victim and can continue to do damage every action turn thereaf- ter. Any claw that missed may attempt to strike again each action turn until it grabs the victim and remains attached.A sifoners symbiotic attachment power will only work against one per- son at a time, but if the victim dies, the sifoner is unaffected. Once the attach- ment is made successfully, the victim is drained of one intelligence point per turn afterwards, until an intelligence of 1 is reached and the victim becomes animal-like in behavior. At this point, the sifoner will leave the victim. Once drained, a victim will slowly begin to recover lost intelligence points at a rate of 1 point per day. No conscious or men- tal mutations of any sort may be used while the victim is recovering, until full intelligence is again restored. A sifoner can command its victim to take simple actions necessary to help the sifoner escape from those trying to slay it.Sifoners are usually encountered sin- gly, though pairs may be seen during mating season (which comes in the spring, once every decade). Sifoners lair in ground burrows or under rocky overhangs, and they have learned to use branches, leaves, and stones to hide their lairs from view. Eggs will be present in a lair in late spring 50% of the time. Young sifoners grow to adult- hood in 4-5 months. Sifoners do not breed or live long in captivity, and are thus useless as guardians.",

The nep ep also has unique boring tendrils that only activate from the roots when and item with a lot of energy is dropped or left under the tree. The tree senses this power and bores up under and through the item, draining it of its energy. Therefore, there are usually some items of an electrical short under the tree, usually buried beneath the fallen needles. The GM should determine these items randomly; the number of items found is 1d6. There is only a 25% chance any item is in useable shape, it will have a small hole bored into it and will always be drained of all power. Even those items beyond repair may still be scavenged for parts or as curiosities."

It resembles a small triceratops without horns.  It has a plate / crest around its head that can flare out when the Smovbai wishes it, and allow the rider to sit on the neck.  Once in position the rider is considered to be better protected from all attacks that don't come from the front.  The Smovbai are found around swamps, marshy areas, along rivers and lakes and other areas where there is a lot of standing water.Behavior:Any creature 7.5' tall may ride a Smobai.

If he is climbing man made surfaces consider dex to be 25.  There is no combat benefit.)(M) Intution, Telekinesis, Seizures, Molecular Disruption, Life leech, Periodic amnesia, Mental Multiplier, Force Field Generation, Direction SenseDescription: He slouches to 1.5 meters tall.  His large ears stick out from a bald head.  The deformity of his arms and legs would earn him a spot on any beggers' steet.  His nose is completly sealed over, eliminating any sense of smell.  Waja usually reeks of garbage and rot.  His entire body is covered with small suction cups, even his head and face.Behavior:Waja was once a Radioactivist.  Mebers of that cyrptic alliance worship the glory and power of the atom, and regularly subject themselves to radiation in order to gain more mutations.  Waja was exiled from their ranks for his preponderance of defects, which were taken as a sign of his weak faith.  Waja has surived by always pretending to be dumber then he really is, and by staying out of trouble.  His intution has helped tremendouly.  As the Game Master, when role-playing Waja, don't breathe through your nose while speaking.  This simulates his nasal delivery.  Be advized that Waja only uses his mutations in times of dire need.  He has survived in the wilderness by playing the harmless mutantCombat: In combat, Waja turns on his force field, and keeps up a dialogue on the current condition of his fear while racing about aimlesly.  In a heated battle, he uses his mental blast.  IF his life is directly threatened, he might use a molecular disruption.  AFterwards he always denies any accusations, for good or bad, regarding his role in battle. Equiptment: Rags, dagger, Walking Staff, assorted JunkSociety: N/A"

Inslith eat plastic, rubber, and metal and for that reason prefer to live inside machinery or electrical conduits.  Though the damage of its bite is relatively weak, the inslith has daws and teeth that are well-adapted for gnawing through plastic and metal pipes as well as cables and wire.  The inslith secretes a strong acid saliva that aids in the digesting the material it eats.  The snake can also spit this acid at enemies.  The snake stores a small amount of acid, and it can make this ranged attack every 5 actions.",

They will brack on contact with anything warm, sending shards flying witin a 1 meter radius (1d2-1) Damage.  The baby snake inside is harmless at this stage, an unbroken egg is valuable to hunters.  What is more valuable is the skins that the sinslith shed in their nest.  Every month the inslith grows a new skin and discards his own in the nest.  There are 1d12 skins in a nest for each inslith that lives there.  A shed skin can be made into armor by any hunter with a roll against Agility DC 15.  It requires 100 skins to make a set of armor for a human sized creature.  The armor will be AC 4 and includes a helm, but not a shield.  The armor is acid proof.",

Inslith eat plastic, rubber, and metal and for that reason prefer to live inside machinery or electrical conduits.  Though the damage of its bite is relatively weak, the inslith has daws and teeth that are well-adapted for gnawing through plastic and metal pipes as well as cables and wire.  The inslith secretes a strong acid saliva that aids in the digesting the material it eats.  The snake can also spit this acid at enemies.  The snake stores a small amount of acid, and it can make this ranged attack every 5 actions.Combat: Due to the snakes natural camouflage when in its usual enviroment, when a character first looks into a conduit or machine the only way he can tell if a black cord is really a snake and not a normal electrical cord is by making a sucessful INT at -2 vs 17Equiptment: Inslith do not collect items and will have no treasure.  However, when found here is a 15% chance that the nest contains two eggs.  Inslith eggs resemble black, crystalline rocks.  They will brack on contact with anything warm, sending shards flying witin a 1 meter radius (1d2-1) Damage.  The baby snake inside is harmless at this stage, an unbroken egg is valuable to hunters.  What is more valuable is the skins that the sinslith shed in their nest.  Every month the inslith grows a new skin and discards his own in the nest.  There are 1d12 skins in a nest for each inslith that lives there.  A shed skin can be made into armor by any hunter with a roll against Agility DC 15.  It requires 100 skins to make a set of armor for a human sized creature.  The armor will be AC 4 and includes a helm, but not a shield.  The armor is acid proof.",

	    "Behavior": "Sarbis usually establish large above ground mining camps.  There are very well protected by the huge amount of slag the Sarbis mine and dump out around the camp, making it almost impossible for a direct charge of any type.  They also construct tall guard towers around the area to oversee the area and guard the access roads from the camp to any other establishments there and the outside world.  Sarbis are notorious traders, having to rely heavily on the outside world for food (primarily meat or insects) for any comforts.  They are particularly fond of large insects for food and prefer Skyzorr'n above all others.",

Though they walk erect and are more human-shaped than their quadrupedal ancestors, they still are unmistakably aardvarks - complete with claws at the end of their arms and legs (though the hand / claes are now somewhat manipulative), a long snout, and extremely powerful body.  The Sarbis are usually miners, though they live above ground in human-type dwellings.  They do not use digging tools, as their extremely power claws are all they need to burrow deep beneath the earth.  To this same end, they have evolved a directional organ which always lets them know where they are in relation to north.  Their heightened senses are particularly effective underground and they are impossible to surprise once they enter caves, tunnels, or any other dark subterranean environments.",
	    "Combat": "While not especially warlike, their proverbial stubborn attitudes and amazing strength make them formidable opponents.  Once a Sarbis has dug its claws into the ground (taking a stand), physical strength of 121+ is needed to move them.  It takes large machines or teams of animals to move a Sarbis.",
	    "Society": "Sarbis form large communities called \"camps.\"  There is always one dominate male who rules the camp.  As previously mentioned, Sarbis are usually miners and provide much of the raw minerals for Gamma World societies.  There value in this capacity, plus their dangerous nature when crossed, have made them better allies than slaves or subjects.",

Though they walk erect and are more human-shaped than their quadrupedal ancestors, they still are unmistakably aardvarks - complete with claws at the end of their arms and legs (though the hand / claes are now somewhat manipulative), a long snout, and extremely powerful body.  The Sarbis are usually miners, though they live above ground in human-type dwellings.  They do not use digging tools, as their extremely power claws are all they need to burrow deep beneath the earth.  To this same end, they have evolved a directional organ which always lets them know where they are in relation to north.  Their heightened senses are particularly effective underground and they are impossible to surprise once they enter caves, tunnels, or any other dark subterranean environments.Behavior:Sarbis usually establish large above ground mining camps.  There are very well protected by the huge amount of slag the Sarbis mine and dump out around the camp, making it almost impossible for a direct charge of any type.  They also construct tall guard towers around the area to oversee the area and guard the access roads from the camp to any other establishments there and the outside world.  Sarbis are notorious traders, having to rely heavily on the outside world for food (primarily meat or insects) for any comforts.  They are particularly fond of large insects for food and prefer Skyzorr'n above all others. Combat: While not especially warlike, their proverbial stubborn attitudes and amazing strength make them formidable opponents.  Once a Sarbis has dug its claws into the ground (taking a stand), physical strength of 121+ is needed to move them.  It takes large machines or teams of animals to move a Sarbis.  Equiptment: Sarbis have been known to employ a rare tech level 3 item along with their more common tech level 2 devices and weapons.  They seldom wear any clothing or armor, usually just gear for holding or carrying provisions and devices.Society: Sarbis form large communities called \"camps.\"  There is always one dominate male who rules the camp.  As previously mentioned, Sarbis are usually miners and provide much of the raw minerals for Gamma World societies.  There value in this capacity, plus their dangerous nature when crossed, have made them better allies than slaves or subjects.",

Immunity to all mental mutations except those of their queenDescription: Skyzorr'n are mutated giant ants that walk erect, have large mandibles they use as tools or weapons, and have four arms (all controllable at once to some degree). Skyzorr'n can be found almost anywhere except cold climes;  they are constantly sending scouts and explorers out to bring back information on possible new areas to colonize.

Warriors are the defenders of the colony, explorers into dangerous areas, and sometimes serve as mercenaries. Combat: All Skyzorr'n have Sarbis phobia, a dreaded fear of the Sarbis race (probably an ancient race memory of ant-eating aardvarks). When a Sarbis appears on the scene, Skyzorr'n will operate at a - 3 CS penalty (or at - 30, whichever is appropriate). Equiptment: Skyzorr'n usually use Tech Level II devices and weapons, except for the sacred warriors which often have Tech Level III weapons. Society: No other race gets along well with the Skyzorr'n; they are fierce, warlike beings who believe it is their destiny to one day rule Gamma World. They belong to no cryptic alliances and owe allegiance only to their own race and destiny. This does not mean that they are isolationists; the Skyzorr'n frequently trade with merchants and other races for the treasure their queen desires.

Upon seeing the adventurer, the verbat will immediately announce a telepatic requiest, \"Toll, Please!\"  Toll-taking is standard with Verbat and can take the form of payments of loot, work in exchange for passage (like hauling the carcass of a dead opponent out of the area), or fighting for the Verbat (in the case of extremely tough advesaros it cannot fight alone).  Paymenst always must be made both upon entering or leaving a Verbat's area.  The exact toll is determined by the GM and depends on how much trouble it is for the Verbat to keep the area clear and how wealty the party appears to be.  Once a party becomes friendly with a Verbat (passing though his area and paying toll more than 4 times), imformation may be gained, by payment or otherwise, from the Verbat.  This information always concerns the area the Verbat patrolls."

	    "Description": "Their coloration is normally dark brown, with a light brown patch on their chest (bright red in the case of the non-aggressive males).  Arrowbeaks have a primitive organization, with a flock consisting of several mated pairs,with the oldest female as the leader. Chicks are raised communally, maturing after 2 years. They are quite peaceful during summer and autumn, even allowing travellers to camp under their roosts, as long as they are quiet and unobtrusive.",

	    "Behavior": "During the spring mating season, these mutated robins are one of the most dangerous avian lifeforms known in the Gamma World, due to their requirement to ingest several pints of mammalian blood for each egg produced. Their chameleon power is usually only used in combat. The usual tactics used by arrowbeaks is for the males in a flock to cause a distraction ahead of a group of victims, while the females dive in and attack from behind. As they use their chameleon power and glide silently during their attack, they are very difficult to detect (sonar or infravision usually work). They will attack separate targets, unless there are fewer targets than attackers. After a target has been paralyzed, the attacking arrowbeak will suck blood from the target for 5 rounds, then fly off to roost and deliver an egg. If an attacker fails, she will generally harass the party to protect the successful individuals. Males will not usually participate in combat except when attacked.",

In appearance, these malevolent creatures have the synthesized features of a man and a gargantuan insect. The creatures are bipedal (standing between 150-200 centimeters) and have only two arms. Their bloated abdomen and thorax are connected to a large head complete with long, fern-like antennae and broad mandibles.When attacking, Buggers either strike with their two claws and bite for 1-6, 1-6, and 1-10 points respectively or they can use a crude weapon such as an axe, sword, or mace. When using a weapon the creatures can also bite.These termite men live within nests made up of a myriad of burrowed passages and chambers. Due to the lack of light in the Buggem nests, the creatures hove developed heightened senses that allow the Buggers to see in the dark. Buggem nests ore found in almost all climes and are easily recognizable by the prominent mound of dirt formed over the opening into their chambers. Like any of their smaller relations these termite creatures are primarily fungus eaters, raising their own food supply deep within their dark burrows in strange fungus gardens.Although they prefer to remain in their nests, Buggers must occasionally venture outside to get hosts for their parasitic infants. These hosts ore invariably humanoid and always perish during the eventual hatching of the young. In a world of far more dangerous creatures, the Buggem species survives partially due to two unique mutations that occur occasionally among their kind. Appearing in one creature out of twenty, the Buggers' first mutation is that of gas generation. Several different types of gas are possible with varying probability of appearance. The types and associated probability are:  1-40 Opaque Gas, 42-80 Caustic Gas, 81-100 Poison Gas Each mutated Buggem is able to generate only one type of gas, and may use this ability only three times per day. All Buggers are immune to any of the gases` effects.The second mutation is more rare, occurring in only 1% of the species. The abnormality causes the termite man's size and strength to decrease, but, in return the Creature gains greater dexterity, heightened   , and telepathic ability. These telepaths are able to communicate with any member of their hive regardless of distance or physical obstruction. They direct all important actions taken in their nests, allowing a degree of intelligence to enter into their lesser brothers' actions.

The Bulo is a creature that predators generally tend to avoid unless extremely hungry.

	    "Behavior": "The Bulo is extremely protective of its current field it grazes in and will kill or frighten off intruders.  Combining the great charging speed of an animal this size along with a very evil temper, hrough the years Bulos have developed a thick skull which has aided them in perfecting their primary mode of attack...the charge. When angered, a Bulo will charge its target, butt the creature with its head and knock it down, and then attempt to trample the prone victim. Anytime a Bulo successfully butts its target,that creature is considered knocked down to the ground and must fight with a -2 penalty \"to hit\"during its next combat round.A Bulo will attempt to trample any victim it knocks down (roll again \"to hit\" with the trample attack).Any target trampled can not be bitten that round by the Bulo.If a person is trampled by a Bulo,there is also a chance that any items being carried by that person will be damaged or destroyed (GM's decision depending on items and circumstances). The ability to absorb a certain amount of damage from physical blows each round (see KineticAbsorption mutation) makes the Bulo one of the toughest opponents around. Finally,the power to shape- change allows the Bulo to change form into any one of the following three flying insect-like creatures; a Blaash, a Blight, or a Cal Then.",

They are small, and therefore not able to inflict much damage on larger creatures. When faced with larger creatures, they prefer to use their mutations to remain hidden. If they are spotted, they will use their Stunning Force mutation and attempt to escape if at all possible. If left with no option but to fight, they will bite and attempt to rub their bodies (which are coated with a contact poison) on any exposed flesh they can find on the enemy creatures. Croakers band together in groups for mutual protection and for breeding. They spawn year-round with suitable temperature and rainfall. Eggs are laid in long-standing water - ditches, canals, streams, and ponds."

	    "Description": "These huge winged creatures are the mutated descendents of the American Bald Eagle. The e'glee live on the craggy slopes of the highest mountains. Having a wing span close to 8 meters (Oversized Body Parts), leathery dark-brown wings and well- developed back and wing muscles, these mutants, when adult, are able to carry a single passenger when flying at normal speed. E'glee still bear the traditional mark of the bald eagle, white head feathers.E'glee are sometimes used as a steed by other mutants and humans but this is only in rare instances because the e'glee is very wary of other creatures. When meeting a creature that it does not trust, the e'glee first lets out a tremendous screech and uses its powers (Fear Generation) to ward of the unwanted visitor or enemy. With their giant taloned claws (6d8 damage) and curved beak (3d6 damage) these mutants are deadly hunters and killers.

	    "Description": "Floth-Ha are mutated \"common house\" moths. They are virtually identical to their predecessors except for their extra front two limbs from which they can manipulate objects and also for their great size. (wingspan is an impressive 3m) Their bodies are covered in a fine fur, and for those who have seen a Shutter in flight, the underside is a palette of light browns. Due to the chameleon powers their back and wings poses, the natural coloring of these surfaces are unknown. Floth-Ha do have antenna but rely primarily on sonar to guide them.",

	    "Reactions": "",
	    "Behavior": "These creatures are herbivores and usually feed upon the bark of trees however the delicacy of cotton, wool, or even leather are too good to pass up. There have been numerous reports of unwary travelers who've been attacked only to have their clothes eaten from their bodies. The creatures methods are predictable, they will swoop from above and grab on with all 6 legs digging into the victim.(clinging) It's other 2 manipulative arms undo buckles, snaps, zippers etc. Survivors tell that once you get past the initial cling, the act of devouring the clothing is relatively painless. When the Floth-Ha is upon it's victim, it drapes it's wings over to completely engulf the victim. It's back and wings are it's primary defense, they are completely impervious to all forms of physical attacks, lasers and radiation type weapons, And since they have chameleon capabilities, it's extremely possible to not even see the actual attack on the ground.  Shutters are solitary animals and will only be in numbers of 2 during mating. They are attracted to heat and bright lights. The name \"Shutters\" comes from the unconscious twitching they display while they sleep clinging to a tree. This motion temporally negates their chameleon bonuses and makes them more easily visible. Of course when they cling in this manner they only expose their wings and back , protecting their soft underbellies.(AC of only 5) When they cling in this manner, they cannot be forcefully removed, unless a well orchestrated combined PS of 40 is applied. Even in death, the creatures remain affixed. For obvious reasons, the Shutters' wings are very valuable in Gamma Terra, and will fetch the handsome price of 8,500 domars for just 1 of a set of wings.",

(wingspan is an impressive 3m) Their bodies are covered in a fine fur, and for those who have seen a Shutter in flight, the underside is a palette of light browns. Due to the chameleon powers their back and wings poses, the natural coloring of these surfaces are unknown. Floth-Ha do have antenna but rely primarily on sonar to guide them.Behavior:These creatures are herbivores and usually feed upon the bark of trees however the delicacy of cotton, wool, or even leather are too good to pass up. There have been numerous reports of unwary travelers who've been attacked only to have their clothes eaten from their bodies. The creatures methods are predictable, they will swoop from above and grab on with all 6 legs digging into the victim.(clinging) It's other 2 manipulative arms undo buckles, snaps, zippers etc. Survivors tell that once you get past the initial cling, the act of devouring the clothing is relatively painless. When the Floth-Ha is upon it's victim, it drapes it's wings over to completely engulf the victim. It's back and wings are it's primary defense, they are completely impervious to all forms of physical attacks, lasers and radiation type weapons, And since they have chameleon capabilities, it's extremely possible to not even see the actual attack on the ground.  Shutters are solitary animals and will only be in numbers of 2 during mating. They are attracted to heat and bright lights. The name \"Shutters\" comes from the unconscious twitching they display while they sleep clinging to a tree. This motion temporally negates their chameleon bonuses and makes them more easily visible. Of course when they cling in this manner they only expose their wings and back , protecting their soft underbellies.(AC of only 5) When they cling in this manner, they cannot be forcefully removed, unless a well orchestrated combined PS of 40 is applied. Even in death, the creatures remain affixed. For obvious reasons, the Shutters' wings are very valuable in Gamma Terra, and will fetch the handsome price of 8,500 domars for just 1 of a set of wings.",

	    "Behavior": "So large and well armored that they have few natural enemies, these animals have been adapted into war-mounts by many societies. A odd saddle with rails that run parallel to the bottom of the beast , (wrapping under the segmented armor plates to prevent it from rolling into a ball) is fitted at the apex of the creatures back. A pair of barbed spikes is inserted under the first segment of armored plate, between the head and the torso of the animal. Reins are attached to these spikes to facilitate guiding the animal, just as with a more traditional steed. A set of stirrups dangle from the saddle and are connected by chains to the trailing edge of the rails. By pulling forward on these stirrups the creature is encouraged to move forward. These creatures are very fast, about half the speed of a centisteed, at full speed.If attacked, a herd will run in a random direction. If one runs over a creature (less than 3m tall and it must make a To- Hit roll), it inflicts 4d10 points of damage.Giant potato bugs (or sow bugs or pill bugs) are very important to the plains ecosystem. They are hunted by specialized carnivores (like the Ti'tal and the obb) that can break through the bugs' armor.",

The Lorida Orp, if able, will attack a foe from afar with any firearm it may have; and then it will engage its prey in hand to hand combat using any weapon it may on hand and it will also use its natural weaponry.As a whole, Lorida orps are xenophobic as several races consider their young to be a delicacy. However, there are two races that the Lorida orps get along with; the spider lill and the drax (see next issue). Also, there is the rare Lorida Orp that seeks to venture from its familiar surroundings and lead the life of an adventurer.Lorida Orp encounters are usually with a male patrol, any one unfortunate enough to find a base camp will have to deal with very irate and protective females and even the young will fight.

It snaps up and strikes forward, attempting to crush the prey with its mandibles. The poison is produced in a gland right behind the eyes and is excreted on to the mandibles. A rhya tries not to move much and thus will rarely hunt down escaped prey. If a predator shows up, a rhya will withdraw its breathing tubes and rely on its gills."

	    "Number_Appearing_Dice": "Cybohunters are the weakest and most common of all known Hunter robots. They were used to track down dangerous enemies, such as escaped prisoners and fugitives during the Social Wars. They track fleeing characters using special sensors, and kill with all of the special weapons and functions at their command. Once a mission has been de- tailed by a character with a Stage IV I.D. or a cybernetic installation (or some other ancient command area), the Cybohunter tracks immediately, ignoring any further attempts by any force to command it, until itself or the objective is destroyed. A Cybo- hunter only destroys its objective (and any creature or being that tries to interfere or stop its function in any way), not harming those that do not cross the Hunters path.The Cybohunter appears as a massive 5- meter tall humanoid. It is silver and con- structed out of a very thick duralloy compound. The head contains a horizontal band of black glass, through which shines a moving, glowing red light  its eye. The tracker has various antennae on the out- side of the helmet that constantly move and act as the sensors. The remaining shape of the body is basically human in appearance, in larger proportions, with various indentations and protrusions used for holding and storing equipment and weaponry.This unit is equipped with a great vari- ety of powerful offensive and defensive features. Any and all of these features may be used at the same time, as with any Hunter-class robot.The Cybohunter generates an electrical damage field that does 3d10 hp damage to anyone who touches it. This includes those who hit it with metal of any sort, but no damage occurs to characters protected by a force field of any sort (the force field takes 5d10 hp damage per contact).The Cybohunter is capable of command- ing all nearby robots as if it were carrying a Stage V I.D. It can control any of the robots listed in the GAMMA WORLD game that were not made for offensive purposes up to a distance of 200 meters away; ro- bots that are no longer controlled or that leave the 200-meter area revert to their former instructions and command. Offen- sive robots (Death Machines, Warbots, and Security Robots) stay out of the Cybohun- ters way but do not obey its directions. The robot is equipped with a force field that can absorb up to 100 hp damage per action turn.The Cybohunter has been partially fitted with powered assault armor that covers areas not needed for combat. This armor gives the unit the structural capability to lift and support enormous weights (de- pending on each individual unitsstrength). Jumps of up to 30 meters are possible and can be made once every action turn.The Cybohunter generates an electronic- disruptor field that overloads all energy circuits not within a 5-meter diameter surrounding the unit itself. This field affects equipment and energy-using weap- ons up to a distance of 50 meters; there is a 25% chance that the item is able to with- stand the effects of this field. These de- vices become overloaded and their circuits fuse, totally destroying them.As combat is the Cybohunters main reason for existence, a great deal of its equipment is devoted to the task of de- stroying opponents. One of the Cybohun- ters main modes for accomplishing this is hand-to-hand combat. The powered fists do 9d6 hp damage. All attacks made in non-weapon combat are made at an addi- tional 1d6 hp damage to the damage listed, due to its microscopic sensors. The fore- arms of the Cybohunter have slots on the outsides that allow large blades to be extended or contracted. These arm blades do 5d6 hp damage and may possibly hit the character if the powered fist attack misses (roll twice during the same action turn for each fist; the first roll is to hit with the fist and the second roll is to de- termine if the blades hit). Attached to the back of the wrists of each hand are dural- loy claws which can be used much as the natural attacks of mutated animals are performed, causing 4d8 hp damage. The claws can be retracted or used in conjunc- tion with the arm blades (as explained above).The legs of this unit are capable of dis- charging an adhesive paste compound along a ridge on the outer surface of the leg. This paste does not effect the Cybo- hunters attack ability but may be used to hamper a characters movement. Charac- ters that come near or in contact with the legs have an attack made on them using the Cybohunters normal roll to hit. If this attack roll is successful, then the victim is stuck to the duralloy leg and can be auto- matically hit by any weapon. The charac- ter can escape only by the greatest effort (roll Physical Strength  4 or less on per- centile dice), which causes 2d4 hp damage to the victim whether successful or not. There are a total of 10 doses of adhesive paste that can be used for this attack. The paste is automatically removed when the character is freed or dead, using another chemical stored in the legs that causes 2d6 hp damage (acid burn) to characters that again come in contact with the robot. This acidic chemical evaporates in two action turns, and the adhesive attack is again possible afterwards.For ranged combat, the Cybohunter has a large selection of highly efficient attacks. Fitted into the index finger of each hand are independently powered laser pistols. The laser pistols do 5d8 hp damage and have a range of 90 meters. Each is pow- ered by two hydrogen energy cells that allow each pistol to make 20 shots before needing to be recharged.Attached to the right arm of the Cybo- hunter is an independently powered laser rifle. This rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types: an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area. The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand- ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must roll their dexterity or under on a d20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters. As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over time). At- tacks using mental powers can be made normally on the Cybohunter.",

Only the larger breeds of dogs (Dobermans, German Shepherds, etc) have managed to survive to create this new breed. Wolf climbers have also been reported to exist in the Rocky Mountains and northern forests of Kanda.As with normal dogs, this breed uses simple pack tactics to surround, and bring down weakened prey, or solitary travelers. The main difference is the fact that they also will use trees to help them surround their prey. So if you are in a forest, and find yourself surrounded by a pack of these creatures, don't bother to climb a tree to escape. You'll find yourself staring down the maws of several of these animals.Just as a normal pack dog, these animals are lead by both an alpha male and alpha female. The rest of the pack is subservient to these, unless another male thinks it is strong enough to challenge the leader. Females tend to build dens high in large trees, ruins, or if nothing appropriate is available, in dens on the ground. The females give birth late in spring to litters of 2D4 pups. The pups, if caught at an early age, can easily be domesticated. Wolf climbers can not be domesticated however.",

They are from beyond our galaxy. They are humanoid in appearance except for a slightly bloated head having a number of tentacles where their mouth should be  looking a bit like some Lovecraftian horror. They have two large milky white eyes with no pupils giving the impression of soulless evil. Their skin is the darkest black, almost seeming to absorb light. It is clammy/slimy to the touch. They consider mankind cattle and slaves. They eat the brains (and occasionally flesh) of those they consider lower life forms. Though incredibly intelligent, they are a thoroughly vile and evil race. They seem to dislike bright light. Their technology is based on crystal (and occasionally organic) devices (Tech V). They use a hieroglyphic written language and no spoken language. They communicate entirely by telepathy. To a player character, Shreelon `speech' sounds like a loud echoing whisper inside their head. The Shreelon work by `proxy' whenever they can, finding it advantageous to work through others or use acquired resources to accomplish most tasks rather than direct investment. However, when they are encountered in the flesh, they are terrifying adversaries. Following this principle, there is some evidence to suggest that the Shreelon had a hand in the founding of the Friends of Entropy cryptic alliance.  This enables them to further divide and weaken Earth's sentient races without direct risk to themselves. Even before their attack on Earth, it appears that the aliens were working behind the scenes, influencing events which would set the stage for the apocalypse (inciting nation against nation). Their Mental Control ability is slightly different than listed in the rulebook.

Many of their minions were encountered in that adventure, but the Shreelon themselves never made an appearance. They are from beyond our galaxy. They are humanoid in appearance except for a slightly bloated head having a number of tentacles where their mouth should be  looking a bit like some Lovecraftian horror. They have two large milky white eyes with no pupils giving the impression of soulless evil. Their skin is the darkest black, almost seeming to absorb light. It is clammy/slimy to the touch.

	    "Combat": "They seldom attack anything except to defend themselves or their friends. The buzzbirds sonic attack does no hit-point damage, but it affects the nervous system of creatures so endowed. It hits as a mental attack of MS 7, and does not affect unintelligent plants, invertebrates, or deaf creatures. If a creature is affected, the GM should roll 1dl0 on the appropriate table.  Affected creatures do not recognize friends if an 8, 9, or 10 is rolled on the table. They rarely attack the buzzbird, which attacks while flying rapidly past its opponents. The attack affects all creatures, friend or foe, within a 5-meter radius, and is +2 to hit creatures with better-than-human hearing. Covering ones ears has no effect on this attack. The buzzbird can continue this attack nonstop for an indefinite period of time. If a creature recovers from one of the effects on the table but is still in the area of effect of the buzz, a new attack should be rolled; if the creature is affected again, a new 1d10 should be rolled on the table.1 - 3 Creature falls on the ground holding its ears for two action turns or for the duration of the buzz, whichever is shorter.4 - 5 Creature runs away at top speed for three minutes.6 - 7 Creature runs around in circles, or otherwise moves rapidly and aimlessly in the same area for two action turns or for the duration of the buzz, whichever is longer.8 - 9 Creature physically attacks the nearest other creature at +2 to hit and double damage for two turns or for the buzz duration, which- ever is longer.10 Creature attacks the nearest object, as above. If no object is within arms reach, the creature may attack the ground (but not itself or its own gear).",

	    "Description": "Giggle bugs spend most of their lives as caterpillars (the statistics in parentheses above refer to the adult moths, which do not have the beguiling mutation). Unlike most caterpillars with protective coloration, giggle bugs are quite prominent and distinctive: spotted, striped, and checkered in green, yellow, pink, red, blue, and white, with a clownlike false face on each end and mobile projections that resemble pin- wheels and party noisemakers. The effect is magnified by its mutational powers to become highly comical  so much so that most intelligent creatures that see a giggle bug must make a successful check vs. their MS x 2 or collapse in helpless laughter. A new MS check is rolled every 6 action turns after a failed one; if a crea- ture makes a subsequent roll, then it may stop laughing and crawl away. However, if a creature having made a successful MS check continues to look at the caterpillar, however, or even thinks about it clearly enough to make an attack, another MS check is required every action turn.If a creature laughs without rest for more minutes than it has points of CN, then exhaustion sets in, incapacitating the creature for 3 search turns. During this time, the creature may make no attacks, and must move at half speed. Creatures (including PCs) with IN less than 4 or greater than 16 are not affected by the giggle bugs comical appearance. Blind creatures and machines with purely artificial intelligence (like androids and robots) are also immune, but cyborgs, with their human brains, are not.Giggle bugs are immune to all kinds of poison, and they habitually feed on poisonous plants; consequently, their bodies are also poisonous (roll 3d6 for poison intensity for any giggle bug that a character tries to bite or eat). Giggle bugs remain in cater- pillar form from March through November. They pupate in the winter and emerge the following March as huge, gaudy moths that live only long enough to mate and lay eggs. The eggs take a full year to hatch. Eggs, pupae, and adult moths are all harlequin-colored; they cannot excite laughter as the caterpillars do, but they are equally poisonous.",

For this rea- son, they are sometimes called pathfind- ers or roadbuilders in moments of dark humor. If this path is touched before it is a day old, the victim takes 1d6 hp damage from the residual acid. About 50% of all molnang encounters begin with the discov- ery of a molnang track, so molnangs are often surprised or left alone.Molnangs cannot hear, but if they see a living creature within 30 meters in front of them, they train their eyestalks on the interloper and fire a beam equal in every way to that of a black ray gun. If hit from behind, a molnang turns (this takes an action turn) and fires. It can fire a ray every other action turn.The molnang secretes a powerful acid all over its black body. If touched in combat, the acid does an automatic 10d6 hp dam- age to the snails opponent, its weapon, or its armor (as appropriate). The acid ruins any weapon except one made of duralloy, which can survive one (and only one) hit. When an attack misses the snails body, it is assumed to hit the massive, golden shell, which is as sturdy as duralloy, reflects all kinds of energy except kinetic (including heat, cold, radiation, electricity, sound/ blasters, and light/lasers), and is proof against acid and black rays.If it fails a morale check (most likely, if hit more than once or twice in combat), a molnang withdraws into its shell, pulls the operculum shut, and generates a death field. Thereafter, it is unable to fire its death ray (even after regaining conscious- ness) for the rest of the day. Strength equal to the molnangs (in one creature) is required to pull the operculum open while the molnang is alive inside (even if it is unconscious). The molnang can, however, be attacked by a life leech and other men- tal mutations. Vibro weapons and energy maces are not reflected by the shell.Molnangs are good to eat, once they have been leeched of their acid content. However, they contain muscleworm larvae (DRAGON issue #108) 75% of the time, and so should be cooked carefully. The brilliant metallic gold shell is a far greater prize, as it can be cut with vibro tools into shields which reflect beams of heat, light, radiation, sound, etc., as well as acid and black rays. (They are no help against a burst of energy such as a bomb or a sonic last however.) Such actions require a check vs. DX x 4 for a character to bring the shield into play during normal combat conditions (assuming the character is not surprised). The shell weighs 500-800 kg and is worth twice that in gold pieces to someone who can make use of it.Molnangs are seldom hired or recruited because it is all but impossible to safely communicate with them.",

When an attack misses the snails body, it is assumed to hit the massive, golden shell, which is as sturdy as duralloy, reflects all kinds of energy except kinetic (including heat, cold, radiation, electricity, sound/ blasters, and light/lasers), and is proof against acid and black rays.If it fails a morale check (most likely, if hit more than once or twice in combat), a molnang withdraws into its shell, pulls the operculum shut, and generates a death field. Thereafter, it is unable to fire its death ray (even after regaining conscious- ness) for the rest of the day. Strength equal to the molnangs (in one creature) is required to pull the operculum open while the molnang is alive inside (even if it is unconscious). The molnang can, however, be attacked by a life leech and other men- tal mutations. Vibro weapons and energy maces are not reflected by the shell.Molnangs are good to eat, once they have been leeched of their acid content. However, they contain muscleworm larvae (DRAGON issue #108) 75% of the time, and so should be cooked carefully. The brilliant metallic gold shell is a far greater prize, as it can be cut with vibro tools into shields which reflect beams of heat, light, radiation, sound, etc., as well as acid and black rays. (They are no help against a burst of energy such as a bomb or a sonic last however.) Such actions require a check vs. DX x 4 for a character to bring the shield into play during normal combat conditions (assuming the character is not surprised). The shell weighs 500-800 kg and is worth twice that in gold pieces to someone who can make use of it.Molnangs are seldom hired or recruited because it is all but impossible to safely communicate with them.",

For this rea- son, they are sometimes called pathfind- ers or roadbuilders in moments of dark humor. If this path is touched before it is a day old, the victim takes 1d6 hp damage from the residual acid. About 50% of all molnang encounters begin with the discov- ery of a molnang track, so molnangs are often surprised or left alone.Molnangs cannot hear, but if they see a living creature within 30 meters in front of them, they train their eyestalks on the interloper and fire a beam equal in every way to that of a black ray gun. If hit from behind, a molnang turns (this takes an action turn) and fires. It can fire a ray every other action turn.The molnang secretes a powerful acid all over its black body. If touched in combat, the acid does an automatic 10d6 hp dam- age to the snails opponent, its weapon, or its armor (as appropriate).

	    "Description": "These gigantic, kindly natured tortoises roam radioactive deathlands and other dry, desolate places. They are always willing to telepathically talk to any intelligent creature, and gener- ally try to help anyone in trouble or need. The only exception here is a dagmit. This is understandable, since dagmits kill and eat stuhumphagas whenever they can, and make their homes out of the empty shells.When a stuhumphagus is attacked, it immediately withdraws into its shell. It is able to pull the undershell shut so that it is completely protected. In this state, most attacks can only hit the shell (which is still AC 3). Thrusting and slashing weapons, such as spears, arrows, and all but two- handed swords, do not harm the shell even if they hit. Cutting and crushing weapons, such as axes, two-handed swords, and maces do full damage to the shell, which can take damage equal to the stuhumphaguss hit-point total before splitting open. Damage from energy attacks such as sonic blast and heat gener- ation are split evenly between the shell and the tortoise inside, but lasers and energy weapons do their damage to the shell only. Blasters treat the shell as nonliv- ing matter  they put a 10-cm hole in it.The tortoise relies on its defenses as long as it can, and saves stunning force for cases of absolute necessity, even though it can use that mutation three times per day. A stuhumphagus uses thought imitation when attacked with a mental mutation.Stuhumphagas have extra room in their shells; one can carry three human-sized creatures. A stuhumphagus can carry or house friendly, intelligent creatures in its shell at need. The passengers gain all of the shells protection, including immunity to radiation outside. Stuhumphagas sometimes carry Healers through deserts and deathlands, functioning as small mobile hospitals. Stuhumphagas need very little food and water to survive (considering their bulk), but they always know where safe food and water can be found. Stu- humphagas weigh approximately 25 met- ric tons each. If one steps on a smaller creature (something they never do inten- tionally, even to a dagmit, and something they certainly cannot do as an attack in combat), the victim takes 2d6 hp damage. Stuhumphagas heal all damage to their shells at the same rate as they heal dam- age to their bodies. No known medicine can speed up the process.",

	    "Description": "Cybohunters are the weakest and most common of all known Hunter robots. They were used to track down dangerous enemies, such as escaped prisoners and fugitives during the Social Wars. They track fleeing characters using special sensors, and kill with all of the special weapons and functions at their command. Once a mission has been de- tailed by a character with a Stage IV I.D. or a cybernetic installation (or some other ancient command area), the Cybohunter tracks immediately, ignoring any further attempts by any force to command it, until itself or the objective is destroyed. A Cybo- hunter only destroys its objective (and any creature or being that tries to interfere or stop its function in any way), not harming those that do not cross the Hunters path.The Cybohunter appears as a massive 5- meter tall humanoid. It is silver and con- structed out of a very thick duralloy compound. The head contains a horizontal band of black glass, through which shines a moving, glowing red light  its eye. The tracker has various antennae on the out- side of the helmet that constantly move and act as the sensors. The remaining shape of the body is basically human in appearance, in larger proportions, with various indentations and protrusions used for holding and storing equipment and weaponry.This unit is equipped with a great vari- ety of powerful offensive and defensive features. Any and all of these features may be used at the same time, as with any Hunter-class robot.The Cybohunter generates an electrical damage field that does 3d10 hp damage to anyone who touches it. This includes those who hit it with metal of any sort, but no damage occurs to characters protected by a force field of any sort (the force field takes 5d10 hp damage per contact).The Cybohunter is capable of command- ing all nearby robots as if it were carrying a Stage V I.D. It can control any of the robots listed in the GAMMA WORLD game that were not made for offensive purposes up to a distance of 200 meters away; ro- bots that are no longer controlled or that leave the 200-meter area revert to their former instructions and command. Offen- sive robots (Death Machines, Warbots, and Security Robots) stay out of the Cybohun- ters way but do not obey its directions. The robot is equipped with a force field that can absorb up to 100 hp damage per action turn.The Cybohunter has been partially fitted with powered assault armor that covers areas not needed for combat. This armor gives the unit the structural capability to lift and support enormous weights (de- pending on each individual unitsstrength). Jumps of up to 30 meters are possible and can be made once every action turn.The Cybohunter generates an electronic- disruptor field that overloads all energy circuits not within a 5-meter diameter surrounding the unit itself. This field affects equipment and energy-using weap- ons up to a distance of 50 meters; there is a 25% chance that the item is able to with- stand the effects of this field. These de- vices become overloaded and their circuits fuse, totally destroying them.As combat is the Cybohunters main reason for existence, a great deal of its equipment is devoted to the task of de- stroying opponents. One of the Cybohun- ters main modes for accomplishing this is hand-to-hand combat. The powered fists do 9d6 hp damage. All attacks made in non-weapon combat are made at an addi- tional 1d6 hp damage to the damage listed, due to its microscopic sensors. The fore- arms of the Cybohunter have slots on the outsides that allow large blades to be extended or contracted. These arm blades do 5d6 hp damage and may possibly hit the character if the powered fist attack misses (roll twice during the same action turn for each fist; the first roll is to hit with the fist and the second roll is to de- termine if the blades hit). Attached to the back of the wrists of each hand are dural- loy claws which can be used much as the natural attacks of mutated animals are performed, causing 4d8 hp damage. The claws can be retracted or used in conjunc- tion with the arm blades (as explained above).The legs of this unit are capable of dis- charging an adhesive paste compoundalong a ridge on the outer surface of the leg. This paste does not effect the Cybo- hunters attack ability but may be used to hamper a characters movement. Charac- ters that come near or in contact with the legs have an attack made on them using the Cybohunters normal roll to hit. If this attack roll is successful, then the victim is stuck to the duralloy leg and can be auto- matically hit by any weapon. The charac- ter can escape only by the greatest effort (roll Physical Strength  4 or less on per- centile dice), which causes 2d4 hp damage to the victim whether successful or not. There are a total of 10 doses of adhesive paste that can be used for this attack. The paste is automatically removed when the character is freed or dead, using another chemical stored in the legs that causes 2d6 hp damage (acid burn) to characters that again come in contact with the robot. This acidic chemical evaporates in two action turns, and the adhesive attack is again possible afterwards.For ranged combat, the Cybohunter has a large selection of highly efficient attacks. Fitted into the index finger of each hand are independently powered laser pistols. The laser pistols do 5d8 hp damage and have a range of 90 meters. Each is pow- ered by two hydrogen energy cells that allow each pistol to make 20 shots before needing to be recharged.Attached to the right arm of the Cybo- hunter is an independently powered laser rifle. This rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types: an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area. The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand- ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must roll their dexterity or under on ad20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters. As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over time). At- tacks using mental powers can be made normally on the Cybohunter.",

This includes those who hit it with metal of any sort, but no damage occurs to characters protected by a force field of any sort (the force field takes 5d10 hp damage per contact).The Cybohunter is capable of command- ing all nearby robots as if it were carrying a Stage V I.D. It can control any of the robots listed in the GAMMA WORLD game that were not made for offensive purposes up to a distance of 200 meters away; ro- bots that are no longer controlled or that leave the 200-meter area revert to their former instructions and command. Offen- sive robots (Death Machines, Warbots, and Security Robots) stay out of the Cybohun- ters way but do not obey its directions. The robot is equipped with a force field that can absorb up to 100 hp damage per action turn.The Cybohunter has been partially fitted with powered assault armor that covers areas not needed for combat. This armor gives the unit the structural capability to lift and support enormous weights (de- pending on each individual unitsstrength). Jumps of up to 30 meters are possible and can be made once every action turn.The Cybohunter generates an electronic- disruptor field that overloads all energy circuits not within a 5-meter diameter surrounding the unit itself. This field affects equipment and energy-using weap- ons up to a distance of 50 meters; there is a 25% chance that the item is able to with- stand the effects of this field. These de- vices become overloaded and their circuits fuse, totally destroying them.As combat is the Cybohunters main reason for existence, a great deal of its equipment is devoted to the task of de- stroying opponents. One of the Cybohun- ters main modes for accomplishing this is hand-to-hand combat. The powered fists do 9d6 hp damage. All attacks made in non-weapon combat are made at an addi- tional 1d6 hp damage to the damage listed, due to its microscopic sensors. The fore- arms of the Cybohunter have slots on the outsides that allow large blades to be extended or contracted. These arm blades do 5d6 hp damage and may possibly hit the character if the powered fist attack misses (roll twice during the same action turn for each fist; the first roll is to hit with the fist and the second roll is to de- termine if the blades hit). Attached to the back of the wrists of each hand are dural- loy claws which can be used much as the natural attacks of mutated animals are performed, causing 4d8 hp damage. The claws can be retracted or used in conjunc- tion with the arm blades (as explained above).The legs of this unit are capable of dis- charging an adhesive paste compoundalong a ridge on the outer surface of the leg. This paste does not effect the Cybo- hunters attack ability but may be used to hamper a characters movement. Charac- ters that come near or in contact with the legs have an attack made on them using the Cybohunters normal roll to hit. If this attack roll is successful, then the victim is stuck to the duralloy leg and can be auto- matically hit by any weapon. The charac- ter can escape only by the greatest effort (roll Physical Strength  4 or less on per- centile dice), which causes 2d4 hp damage to the victim whether successful or not. There are a total of 10 doses of adhesive paste that can be used for this attack. The paste is automatically removed when the character is freed or dead, using another chemical stored in the legs that causes 2d6 hp damage (acid burn) to characters that again come in contact with the robot. This acidic chemical evaporates in two action turns, and the adhesive attack is again possible afterwards.For ranged combat, the Cybohunter has a large selection of highly efficient attacks. Fitted into the index finger of each hand are independently powered laser pistols. The laser pistols do 5d8 hp damage and have a range of 90 meters. Each is pow- ered by two hydrogen energy cells that allow each pistol to make 20 shots before needing to be recharged.Attached to the right arm of the Cybo- hunter is an independently powered laser rifle. This rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types: an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area. The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand- ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must roll their dexterity or under on ad20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters. As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over time). At- tacks using mental powers can be made normally on the Cybohunter."

	    "Description": "The Robohunter was specifically constructed for several track- ing purposes, including the ability to fol- low escaping creatures over any type of terrain. The Robohunter was designed for use with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow era, but is now normally controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals (making them very trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the few remaining resistant animal population (those creatures that were not affected by the radiation). It was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the needed function. Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much modified by post-holocaust humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far beyond what would logi- cally be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can never harm crea- tures of Pure Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with non-obvious physical mutations), but always tries to kill or capture any creatures of mutated stock, as well as all characters that have muta- tions which obviously separate them from pure stock. The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and anything that attacks it (including PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms. Due to its pro- gramming, the Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes until whatever current mission it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears as a massive, large-proportioned humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively hidden by a holographic projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental coloring as if it had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings cover the outside of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp duralloy shards that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other units in the Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its weaponry simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and their functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged by an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be charged to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable is fired at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims skin. The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to wrap around a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of 21 or greater to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage), another replaces it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati- cally. The weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter are separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16 and a range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at crea- tures. These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage from bleeding per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area is treated. The razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered by two solar energy cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head of the Robohunter has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached to one side is a flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10 hp damage and has enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire spreading to flammable materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet also has an optical weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive energy in any direction the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect as the mutation radiation eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation like the mutation. This attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy cell source is drained and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from the back of the Robohunter, allowing it to attack in all directions at once in hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10 meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored in the lower chest area of the Robohunter are three magnetic seal nets that are the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter. The Robohunter also has a needler pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful sleeping serum. This serum will cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle. This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10 hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and the weapon has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three hydro- gen energy cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built into the left arm of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter can utilize a modern spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does 3d8 hp damage. The device has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong line that allows the Robohunter to automatically retrieve its spears, as well as dead creatures. The Robohunter is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen energy cell that allows 10 shots. This weapon can only be used in underwater environments and is part of the right arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual defenses. A magnetic field can be created that can either be used to repel or attract small metallic objects near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings, these small objects may be retained only if the being holding them has a strength of 18 or greater. If this field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed buildings, then the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage unless braced against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto- matically to make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field also allows the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials that can be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn. This field has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters can also be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis rod. The field also causes its victim(s) to fall into unconsciousness and not be awakened for 4d4 hours. Plants are not affected by this field, but beings with organic brains are.An energy field that surrounds the Ro- bohunters surface at a 2-centimeter-wide layer does 3d10 hp damage to characters coming into contact with it. The entire duralloy surface of the Robohunter is covered in sharp metallic protrusions, similar to a sharks rough skin (only magni- fied in effect). Individuals pressed against this surface or held there by the robot suffer 2d4 hp damage. The Robohunter may also attempt to bear-hug any crea- ture. This hug requires two consecutive successful fist attacks. Trapped characters take 6d4 hp damage per action turn until dead or rescued.Various equipment and items used for other purposes of tracking and hunting are also present in the Robohunters con- struction. Although not originally planned for offensive use, some of the devices can cause damage. Acid spray was used to destroy the remains of a hunted animal; it can be fired up to 10 meters away and causes 1d8 hp damage per turn until washed away or neutralized. The Robo- hunter has enough acid for 20 spray at- tacks. Two vibro saws used for cutting through dense underbrush can be used to attack and have abilities similar to the vibro blade. Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter is also equipped with herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers to help in the pursuit of deadly game. A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures and large obstructions does 8d6 hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting through duralloy walls in 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter to pass through). The sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor beam capa- ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The Robohunter has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures up to 100 meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting beings. There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal medi-kit on mutated animals). The bot is sealed for underwater use and is able to move 50 meters per turn in this environment. The Robohunter is also able to skim across the surface of land with the aid of anti-grav pods. The Robohunter can obtain only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and defenses normally while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable of changing their structure to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter can resemble the following robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot, Medical Robot, Security Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action turns of inactivity, and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed appearance. The Robohunter has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control other robots as if it had a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive changing ability described above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions made by Knights of Genetic Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable of sustaining 40 hp damage before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp damage before being useless. A fist strike from a Robohunter does 4d6 hp damage.",

Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter is also equipped with herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers to help in the pursuit of deadly game. A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures and large obstructions does 8d6 hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting through duralloy walls in 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter to pass through). The sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor beam capa- ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The Robohunter has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures up to 100 meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting beings. There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal medi-kit on mutated animals). The bot is sealed for underwater use and is able to move 50 meters per turn in this environment. The Robohunter is also able to skim across the surface of land with the aid of anti-grav pods. The Robohunter can obtain only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and defenses normally while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable of changing their structure to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter can resemble the following robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot, Medical Robot, Security Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action turns of inactivity, and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed appearance. The Robohunter has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control other robots as if it had a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive changing ability described above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions made by Knights of Genetic Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable of sustaining 40 hp damage before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp damage before being useless. A fist strike from a Robohunter does 4d6 hp damage.",
	    "FINAL_OUTPUT": "Robohunter 'Robotic Hunter/Tracker' (1): Init +7; atk see description; AC 11; HD 20D12 hp 130; MV 90' or GravPods 75' ; 1d20+1d20; SV Fort +0, Ref -3, Will -3Description: The Robohunter was specifically constructed for several track- ing purposes, including the ability to fol- low escaping creatures over any type of terrain. The Robohunter was designed for use with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow era, but is now normally controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals (making them very trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the few remaining resistant animal population (those creatures that were not affected by the radiation). It was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the needed function. Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much modified by post-holocaust humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far beyond what would logi- cally be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can never harm crea- tures of Pure Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with non-obvious physical mutations), but always tries to kill or capture any creatures of mutated stock, as well as all characters that have muta- tions which obviously separate them from pure stock. The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and anything that attacks it (including PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms. Due to its pro- gramming, the Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes until whatever current mission it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears as a massive, large-proportioned humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively hidden by a holographic projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental coloring as if it had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings cover the outside of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp duralloy shards that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other units in the Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its weaponry simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and their functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged by an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be charged to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable is fired at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims skin. The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to wrap around a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of 21 or greater to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage), another replaces it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati- cally. The weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter are separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16 and a range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at crea- tures. These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage from bleeding per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area is treated. The razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered by two solar energy cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head of the Robohunter has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached to one side is a flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10 hp damage and has enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire spreading to flammable materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet also has an optical weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive energy in any direction the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect as the mutation radiation eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation like the mutation. This attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy cell source is drained and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from the back of the Robohunter, allowing it to attack in all directions at once in hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10 meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored in the lower chest area of the Robohunter are three magnetic seal nets that are the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter. The Robohunter also has a needler pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful sleeping serum. This serum will cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle. This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10 hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and the weapon has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three hydro- gen energy cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built into the left arm of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter can utilize a modern spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does 3d8 hp damage. The device has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong line that allows the Robohunter to automatically retrieve its spears, as well as dead creatures. The Robohunter is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen energy cell that allows 10 shots. This weapon can only be used in underwater environments and is part of the right arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual defenses. A magnetic field can be created that can either be used to repel or attract small metallic objects near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings, these small objects may be retained only if the being holding them has a strength of 18 or greater. If this field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed buildings, then the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage unless braced against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto- matically to make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field also allows the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials that can be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn. This field has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters can also be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis rod. The field also causes its victim(s) to fall into unconsciousness and not be awakened for 4d4 hours. Plants are not affected by this field, but beings with organic brains are.An energy field that surrounds the Ro- bohunters surface at a 2-centimeter-wide layer does 3d10 hp damage to characters coming into contact with it. The entire duralloy surface of the Robohunter is covered in sharp metallic protrusions, similar to a sharks rough skin (only magni- fied in effect). Individuals pressed against this surface or held there by the robot suffer 2d4 hp damage. The Robohunter may also attempt to bear-hug any crea- ture. This hug requires two consecutive successful fist attacks. Trapped characters take 6d4 hp damage per action turn until dead or rescued.Various equipment and items used for other purposes of tracking and hunting are also present in the Robohunters con- struction. Although not originally planned for offensive use, some of the devices can cause damage. Acid spray was used to destroy the remains of a hunted animal; it can be fired up to 10 meters away and causes 1d8 hp damage per turn until washed away or neutralized. The Robo- hunter has enough acid for 20 spray at- tacks. Two vibro saws used for cutting through dense underbrush can be used to attack and have abilities similar to the vibro blade. Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter is also equipped with herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers to help in the pursuit of deadly game. A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures and large obstructions does 8d6 hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting through duralloy walls in 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter to pass through). The sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor beam capa- ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The Robohunter has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures up to 100 meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting beings. There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal medi-kit on mutated animals).

	    "Description": "This incredibly fast tracking and killing machine was designed for unknown purposes about which Gamma World sages can only speculate. Its abilities and functions make it a perfect construct for following and killing oppo- nents, but the original need for the heavy armor and weaponry of the Manhunter is unknown. The unit may possibly have been used to defeat rogue Defense Borgs and Warbots, in conjunction with several others of its kind. Other uses may have included assaults on advanced-tech gue- rilla squads, but this is not known for sure.The Manhunter is an exceptionally pow- erful robot, but is extremely rare and found only in the surrounding areas of the Cybernetic Installations they were com- manded to guard. Others can possibly be found patrolling vast regions, still follow- ing ancient, outdated programs. They ignore all beings that are not directly affected by their missions, unless foolish characters attack them. As with other units of the Hunter class, the Manhunter continues to follow its mission until com- pleted, ignoring all other commands from any source.This 16-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, 2- meter-high hunting and tracking machine is covered in weapons and sensors. On each side of the unit are 2-meter-long, 1-meter-wide, and 1-meter-high ovoids stored in depressions (these are the cyber robots detailed below). Near the back of the Manhunter are four smaller ovoids (only .5 meters long) stacked in a row, their front ends aimed forward. On the bottom of the robot is a faint outline of a hatch (leading to the stasis chamber) and many projections surrounding it (the pres- sor/tractor beam). On the upper side are the main batteries of weapons and most of the tracking equipment. The sides of the unit are fitted with all of its close-range weaponry.The Manhunter is capable of using all weapons and defenses (including screens and fields) simultaneously. For long-range and immediate killing purposes, the Manhunter has several effective weapons. The unit has a battery of two lasers at- tached to each of twelve optical scanners; each has a range of 500 meters and does 10d6 hp damage per battery. A photonrifle that delivers 18-intensity radiation has a range of 300 meters and a weapon class of 5. Four automatic rifles that have a range of 200 meters and do 10d10 hp damage per burst are included, each equipped with enough ammunition forfive bursts. Two micro-missile launchers with 2d10 missiles are on the sides, each with a range of 1000 meters. One top- mounted mini-missile launcher with 1d10 missiles has a range of 3000 meters and can be fired individually or simultaneously with the micro-missile launcher.Two black ray guns (front- and rear- mounted) have a range of 200 meters, and a laser cannon (front-mounted) does 20d6 hp damage and has a range of 1000 me- ters. A fusion cannon that does the same damage as a fusion bomb but only has a range of 50 meters is centered on the top. A molecular disruptor that has the same effects as the mutation molecular disrup- tion, but has a range of 150 meters and twice the normal chances of disruption, is also top-mounted (on the robots front). A fission gun occupies an upper-rear plat- form, having a ray with the same effect as a dirty fission bomb, with a range of 4000 meters and a weapon class of 16. A top- mounted bomb launcher that has a range of 750 meters is able to fire the following bombs: matter bombs (up to four Alpha, two Beta, or one Delta), fusion bombs(only two), clean fission bombs (only two), mutation bombs (up to four), and negation bombs (up to four). Only one type of bomb load may be carried.The Manhunter also has a grenade launcher (with capacity for up to 100 grenades of any type) that has a range of 150 meters and is used to ferret out hid-den individuals and destroy buildings. The unit has a stun-missile launcher equipped with six stun missiles; each missile has a range of 500 meters and has the effect of stunning everyone within a 30-meter range of the impact for 2d4 search turns. Both weapons are side-mounted on oppo- site sides of the robot  left for the gre- nade launcher and right for the stun-missile rack.Two forward-mounted Mark VI rifles and a battery of four stun-ray rifles (two front, two rear, all bottom-mounted) round out most of the long-range offensive weap- onry. The unit is fitted with a forward- underside taser rifle that has a range of 1000 meters and does 4d8 hp damage, wrapping a cable around the character; only a combined or individual strength of 21 or greater can free a trapped victim (see the Robohunter for details on this weapon). Fifty spare cables are included.A battery of four razor rifles is mounted on the forward underside of the robot. They have a range of 90 meters and each do 8d6 hp damage per hit (causing an additional 1d4 hp damage of bleeding per action turn until blades are removed and wounds are healed). For close-range com- bat, there is a needler rifle with needles coated in a sleep-inducing serum. This serum causes characters to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns. The needler is another front-underside weapon.The Manhunter has several weapon devices not described elsewhere. The unit can spray a heavy nerve-affecting gas. This heavy gas flows down to the lowest level possible (draining into holes) and causes creatures caught in the cloud to save against the effects by rolling under their constitution on d20. Characters who fail this roll are totally unable to perform any movement voluntarily (involuntary muscles such as the heart and lungs still function normally) for 4d20 action turns. Twelve vents (six per side) spread the gas in a 20-meter radius around the robot. Enough gas for six uses is provided.Another gas that can be sprayed up to 20 meters away affects only metallic ob- jects. This gas coats such objects with a chemical that, in two action turns, turns the metal into a frail glasslike substance. Any object coated with this gas is de- stroyed if struck against any hard surface and melts if it is a heat-using device (such as a laser pistol). The chemical must be washed off as soon as it comes into con- tact with metal to counter the damage. The Manhunter is coated with a substance that makes it immune to the gas itself, unless the covering of the robot is cracked to admit the gas into its interior.The Manhunter can also drop a canister that explodes on impact, sending special particles raining down on the ground below. These particles cover a 50-meter- radius area and only affect organic mate- rial (characters totally covered in metallic or plastic armor are unaffected). The robot has only four of these cannisters. Attacked creatures suffer 1d6 damage per action turn for 1d4 turns (while particles are still in the air). Unless affected victims made a CON  2 check on percentile dice, they lose 1d10 points of strength, dexter- ity, and constitution as well for 2d8 hours (no score can drop below 1).The Manhunter also has a force-field destroyer that inflicts 100 hp of damage to all force fields within a 100-meter range, but it wont affect unprotected characters. A force field that can sustain up to 200 hp of damage per action turn is part of the Manhunters protection. The hull of the robot is covered in a thick duralloy shield- ing that allows the unit to operate under- sea or in near vacuum conditions. A reflective hull causes laser attacks to do up to half damage on hits (the robot can take 200 hp of damage from lasers until the reflective ability is destroyed and laser attacks are then made at normal damage).The robot is surrounded by a paralysis field that has a range of 20 meters. This field stuns characters as the paralysis rod can, and it allows the Manhunter to make attacks that automatically hit the para- lyzed victims. This field has enough power for 30 action turns of use.The Manhunter itself is equipped with a holographic projector, which it can use to make itself appear invisible or camou- flaged in the surrounding vegetation.There is a 1% chance per action turn that the projection will flicker, allowing onlook- ers to realize the deception and make attacks as normal until the Manhunter leaves the area. While hunting or tracking, the robot is totally soundless and surprises characters on a roll of 1-5 on d6.A robotic deactivation/activation field can be used up to 200 meters away. The robots can also be controlled by special circuits as if the Manhunter had Stage IV I.D.Herbicides and fungicides can besprayed over an area of 100-meters radius per use (10 such uses possible) to destroy ground cover for hiding fugitives. The unit can immerse its entire self in water, but is incapable of combat while in this environ- ment. It has special remote-controlled drone units which are described below.",

Only one type of bomb load may be carried.The Manhunter also has a grenade launcher (with capacity for up to 100 grenades of any type) that has a range of 150 meters and is used to ferret out hid-den individuals and destroy buildings. The unit has a stun-missile launcher equipped with six stun missiles; each missile has a range of 500 meters and has the effect of stunning everyone within a 30-meter range of the impact for 2d4 search turns. Both weapons are side-mounted on oppo- site sides of the robot  left for the gre- nade launcher and right for the stun-missile rack.Two forward-mounted Mark VI rifles and a battery of four stun-ray rifles (two front, two rear, all bottom-mounted) round out most of the long-range offensive weap- onry. The unit is fitted with a forward- underside taser rifle that has a range of 1000 meters and does 4d8 hp damage, wrapping a cable around the character; only a combined or individual strength of 21 or greater can free a trapped victim (see the Robohunter for details on this weapon). Fifty spare cables are included.A battery of four razor rifles is mounted on the forward underside of the robot. They have a range of 90 meters and each do 8d6 hp damage per hit (causing an additional 1d4 hp damage of bleeding per action turn until blades are removed and wounds are healed). For close-range com- bat, there is a needler rifle with needles coated in a sleep-inducing serum. This serum causes characters to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns. The needler is another front-underside weapon.The Manhunter has several weapon devices not described elsewhere. The unit can spray a heavy nerve-affecting gas. This heavy gas flows down to the lowest level possible (draining into holes) and causes creatures caught in the cloud to save against the effects by rolling under their constitution on d20. Characters who fail this roll are totally unable to perform any movement voluntarily (involuntary muscles such as the heart and lungs still function normally) for 4d20 action turns. Twelve vents (six per side) spread the gas in a 20-meter radius around the robot. Enough gas for six uses is provided.Another gas that can be sprayed up to 20 meters away affects only metallic ob- jects. This gas coats such objects with a chemical that, in two action turns, turns the metal into a frail glasslike substance. Any object coated with this gas is de- stroyed if struck against any hard surface and melts if it is a heat-using device (such as a laser pistol). The chemical must be washed off as soon as it comes into con- tact with metal to counter the damage. The Manhunter is coated with a substance that makes it immune to the gas itself, unless the covering of the robot is cracked to admit the gas into its interior.The Manhunter can also drop a canister that explodes on impact, sending special particles raining down on the ground below. These particles cover a 50-meter- radius area and only affect organic mate- rial (characters totally covered in metallic or plastic armor are unaffected). The robot has only four of these cannisters. Attacked creatures suffer 1d6 damage per action turn for 1d4 turns (while particles are still in the air). Unless affected victims made a CON  2 check on percentile dice, they lose 1d10 points of strength, dexter- ity, and constitution as well for 2d8 hours (no score can drop below 1).The Manhunter also has a force-field destroyer that inflicts 100 hp of damage to all force fields within a 100-meter range, but it wont affect unprotected characters. A force field that can sustain up to 200 hp of damage per action turn is part of the Manhunters protection. The hull of the robot is covered in a thick duralloy shield- ing that allows the unit to operate under- sea or in near vacuum conditions. A reflective hull causes laser attacks to do up to half damage on hits (the robot can take 200 hp of damage from lasers until the reflective ability is destroyed and laser attacks are then made at normal damage).The robot is surrounded by a paralysis field that has a range of 20 meters. This field stuns characters as the paralysis rod can, and it allows the Manhunter to make attacks that automatically hit the para- lyzed victims. This field has enough power for 30 action turns of use.The Manhunter itself is equipped with a holographic projector, which it can use to make itself appear invisible or camou- flaged in the surrounding vegetation.There is a 1% chance per action turn that the projection will flicker, allowing onlook- ers to realize the deception and make attacks as normal until the Manhunter leaves the area. While hunting or tracking, the robot is totally soundless and surprises characters on a roll of 1-5 on d6.A robotic deactivation/activation field can be used up to 200 meters away. The robots can also be controlled by special circuits as if the Manhunter had Stage IV I.D.Herbicides and fungicides can besprayed over an area of 100-meters radius per use (10 such uses possible) to destroy ground cover for hiding fugitives. The unit can immerse its entire self in water, but is incapable of combat while in this environ- ment. It has special remote-controlled drone units which are described below.",
	    "FINAL_OUTPUT": "Manhunter 'Robotic Hunter' (1): Init +7; atk see description; AC 11; HD 25D12 hp 163; MV GravPods 450' ; 1d20+1d20; SV Fort +0, Ref -3, Will -3Description: This incredibly fast tracking and killing machine was designed for unknown purposes about which Gamma World sages can only speculate. Its abilities and functions make it a perfect construct for following and killing oppo- nents, but the original need for the heavy armor and weaponry of the Manhunter is unknown. The unit may possibly have been used to defeat rogue Defense Borgs and Warbots, in conjunction with several others of its kind. Other uses may have included assaults on advanced-tech gue- rilla squads, but this is not known for sure.The Manhunter is an exceptionally pow- erful robot, but is extremely rare and found only in the surrounding areas of the Cybernetic Installations they were com- manded to guard. Others can possibly be found patrolling vast regions, still follow- ing ancient, outdated programs. They ignore all beings that are not directly affected by their missions, unless foolish characters attack them. As with other units of the Hunter class, the Manhunter continues to follow its mission until com- pleted, ignoring all other commands from any source.This 16-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, 2- meter-high hunting and tracking machine is covered in weapons and sensors. On each side of the unit are 2-meter-long, 1-meter-wide, and 1-meter-high ovoids stored in depressions (these are the cyber robots detailed below). Near the back of the Manhunter are four smaller ovoids (only .5 meters long) stacked in a row, their front ends aimed forward. On the bottom of the robot is a faint outline of a hatch (leading to the stasis chamber) and many projections surrounding it (the pres- sor/tractor beam). On the upper side are the main batteries of weapons and most of the tracking equipment. The sides of the unit are fitted with all of its close-range weaponry.The Manhunter is capable of using all weapons and defenses (including screens and fields) simultaneously. For long-range and immediate killing purposes, the Manhunter has several effective weapons. The unit has a battery of two lasers at- tached to each of twelve optical scanners; each has a range of 500 meters and does 10d6 hp damage per battery. A photonrifle that delivers 18-intensity radiation has a range of 300 meters and a weapon class of 5. Four automatic rifles that have a range of 200 meters and do 10d10 hp damage per burst are included, each equipped with enough ammunition forfive bursts. Two micro-missile launchers with 2d10 missiles are on the sides, each with a range of 1000 meters. One top- mounted mini-missile launcher with 1d10 missiles has a range of 3000 meters and can be fired individually or simultaneously with the micro-missile launcher.Two black ray guns (front- and rear- mounted) have a range of 200 meters, and a laser cannon (front-mounted) does 20d6 hp damage and has a range of 1000 me- ters. A fusion cannon that does the same damage as a fusion bomb but only has a range of 50 meters is centered on the top. A molecular disruptor that has the same effects as the mutation molecular disrup- tion, but has a range of 150 meters and twice the normal chances of disruption, is also top-mounted (on the robots front). A fission gun occupies an upper-rear plat- form, having a ray with the same effect as a dirty fission bomb, with a range of 4000 meters and a weapon class of 16. A top- mounted bomb launcher that has a range of 750 meters is able to fire the following bombs: matter bombs (up to four Alpha, two Beta, or one Delta), fusion bombs(only two), clean fission bombs (only two), mutation bombs (up to four), and negation bombs (up to four).

It is equipped with radar capa- bilities (up to 200 meters) and armed with two Mark V pistols as well as two stun rifles on a top mount. A flamegun that has four charges and does 8d10 damage out to 10 meters (weapon class 16) is attached to one end of the robot. The cyber is also capable of spraying a kinetic nullifier fluid (effects are detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game rules) over a 10-meter- square area (six uses possible).Like the underwater model, this under- ground model is equipped with a tractor/ pressor beam capable of lifting up to 200 kilograms for the purpose of transporting the character or object it was assigned to ind back to the Manhunter.The cyber units are used for retrievingor killing characters that flee into areas the Manhunter is not suited for traversing. Once a character is caught by a cyber tracker, he brought back and captured by the Manhunters own tractor/pressor beam (which can lift 500 kilograms). Once in this field, the individual is taken up into the unit and stored in a very special facil- ity on its underside.The Manhunter contains one entire stasis chamber that works as the one described in the GAMMA WORLD game. The character is kept in the state of slee- plike suspended animation until brought back to the commanding Cybernetic Instal- lation for whatever purpose the CI has in mind. Individuals in this chamber can be healed by a robotic medi-kit if necessary, but the stasis chamber can also work as a rejuv chamber for characters who are nearly dead. Up to four man-sized beings (500 kilograms) may be kept in the chamber.The upper surface of the Manhunter also carries a number of special probes, described below.",

An ameebie has two forms. The first is that of an amoph- ous blob, roughly 2-3 m in diameter. The blob is omnivorous and attacks living prey by attempting to stretch out, envelope, and smother the victim. A successful to hit roll means the ameebie has extended a pseudopod and successfully covered the victims face. (Being rather intelligent, the ameebie knows where to aim.) The victim takes 2d6 damage per Action Turn there- after until either it or the ameebie is slain. Blunt weapons (clubs, maces, etc.) do no damage to the ameebie in this form, as it can reshape itself to absorb the blows impact.The ameebies second form is that of a humanoid being, devoid of facial features, hair, and so forth. This form is about 1.5 m tall, and takes 2 Action Turns without interruption to assume. In this form, the ameebie cannot digest prey, as it is using all of its energy to maintain the humanoid shape. It is not known if ameebies can assume other forms.Ameebies cannot be affected by cold. They automatically form a hard, rubbery surface when subjected to cold tempera- tures, and actually gain 1 armor class level for every 10 hit points of cold damagethey absorb (even from mutant cold-gener- ating powers). The lowest armor class they can attain is AC 3.Ameebies are quite intelligent and may join adventuring parties out of curiosity. They see by using thousands of minute eyespots over their bodies. Though severely myopic (missing all objects fur- ther than 10 m away), they cannot be surprised within their limited visual range. Ameebies are deaf, but have normal senses of touch. They eat any organic matter, being immune to poisons. Some ameebies have learned to communicate with other beings using very rudimentary sign language. They also regenerate any physical damage they take.Nothing is known about how ameebies reproduce, though it is guessed that they use budding or fission. Ameebies cannot be contacted by using telepathic powers of any sort. For some reason, they seem to avoid their own kind, and are only encountered singly.",

The victim takes 2d6 damage per Action Turn there- after until either it or the ameebie is slain. Blunt weapons (clubs, maces, etc.) do no damage to the ameebie in this form, as it can reshape itself to absorb the blows impact.The ameebies second form is that of a humanoid being, devoid of facial features, hair, and so forth. This form is about 1.5 m tall, and takes 2 Action Turns without interruption to assume. In this form, the ameebie cannot digest prey, as it is using all of its energy to maintain the humanoid shape. It is not known if ameebies can assume other forms.Ameebies cannot be affected by cold. They automatically form a hard, rubbery surface when subjected to cold tempera- tures, and actually gain 1 armor class level for every 10 hit points of cold damagethey absorb (even from mutant cold-gener- ating powers). The lowest armor class they can attain is AC 3.Ameebies are quite intelligent and may join adventuring parties out of curiosity. They see by using thousands of minute eyespots over their bodies. Though severely myopic (missing all objects fur- ther than 10 m away), they cannot be surprised within their limited visual range. Ameebies are deaf, but have normal senses of touch. They eat any organic matter, being immune to poisons. Some ameebies have learned to communicate with other beings using very rudimentary sign language. They also regenerate any physical damage they take.Nothing is known about how ameebies reproduce, though it is guessed that they use budding or fission.

If cornered or surprised, chessex can attack with their antlers, which are hollow and filled with poisonous fluid that can be injected into antler wounds.

This poison causes a strength loss of only 1d4 points. The tough, leathery hides of the chessex are used as armor (equal in all respects to leather armor), and the meat of these mutant deer has proved to be quite tasty.

However, this coating is unaffected by water, and it leaves a blurry outline that can be seen at short distances, so that creatures seldom walk into a crumbleweed by accident. This invisibility, coupled with the weeds lack of a distinctive smell, turns it from what would be a very prominent part of the desert landscape to a fairly obscure species all the more so since it is poisonous (Intensity Level 16) and totally non-nutritious, and therefore not sought after by any creature.However, the plants means of propogation has made it well known to experienced desert travelers. Crumbleweed spends its life attached to the ground by a very thin and fragile stalk, which dries up and breaks readily in a moderate wind once the plant has pollinated itself and borne seed.

Each irregularity in the ground causes more of the weed to crumble off, until finally it is all gone, having left a trail of seeds which might, under the correct conditions, grow into new crumbleweed.One irregularity which a crumbleweed might roll over and dust with seeds would be a living creature or a party traveling on the desert. The dust is an irritant, affecting creatures as Intensity Level 14 poison, causing sneezing and choking for one Action Turn for every die of damage that would be done by normal poison (treat D results as 4 + Turns of choking, going down the matrix and adding one for every D). Victims are totally incapacitated until they stop choking, but they suffer no further ill effects.Characters surprised by a crumbleweed encounter are always rolled over and all take full damage from the dust. If the party is not surprised (normal chances on the dice), they see the weeds blurry out- line just in time to try to jump aside, which requires a special DX check. The GM should roll a d6 to determine how much of the crumbleweed has already crumbled away (a 1 indicating full, 12-m size, a 6 indicating little larger than man- size (2m)) and multiply each characters DX by the result for the check. To have any chance of evading an oncoming crumbleweed, characters must jump aside as soon as they see it  i.e., players must not hesitate in announcing their PCs actions. Small crumbleweeds are, of course, easier to evade than large ones.Even the largest crumbleweed wont crush any characters it rolls over, since the weight (a maximum of 250 kg) is distributed over such a large area. Most attacks have no effect on a rolling crumbleweed  which is already dead, after all. Physical attacks with weapons or body parts doubles the duration of the sneezing and choking. Firey attacks of any sort cause the crumbleweed to instantly disintegrate into blazing cinders, which vanish into ash within seconds doing no damage to anyone.Heightened smell wont detect an oncoming crumbleweed, while heightened hearing picks up a faint, wispy crunching sound that does not sound dangerous to anyone who has not had experience with crumbleweed.",

If a deng khesh senses any approaching creature or machine within 10 m (it can be surprised only by creatures with no Tech Level 3 or above), it suddenly drops down into a vertical, cylindrical burrow in the sand beneath it, so that its top is 1 m below the surface. If it is surprised, it submerges after any kind of effective attack against it. In either case, it will stay underground until the intruders go away.If the intruders are still there ten Action Turns later, or if they attack the deng khesh in its burrow, it emits a sonic blast every Action Turn until they go away. Deng kheshes are attacked primarily as sources of water; a deng khesh yields, when tapped, one quart of water per 10 hit points. Any body-to-body physical attack (claw, bite, punch, tailslap, etc.) that hits a deng khesh also does 2d4 damage to the attacker because of the cactus spines.",

They establish territorial areas across sea beds, defending them fiercely (even against passing ships and submarines). Being particularly stupid and rather clumsy, draguns may be slowed and stopped by heavy, steel-cable nets dropped across their paths. They seem to like basking on the surface of the ocean during sunny days, and are often encoun- tered during these times.Draguns possess a rudimentary form of communication consisting of bellows, croaks, and grunts, all of which are uttered while the dragun is floating on the surface. Mutant reptiles may learn to imitate these sounds with some success (50% chance of getting a vocalization correct), and this technique, combined with an amplifier, has been used to attract or drive away these beasts.Draguns have three forms of attack. They prefer to bite and swallow prey that is man-sized or smaller, there being a 15% chance per bite that such prey is gulped down whole. A swallowed character takes 2d6 damage per Action Turn from slow suffocation and drowning on water the dragun swallowed, plus an amount of damage equal to his armor class from digestive acids. The victim can only attack with a daggers, claws, or teeth against the draguns insides (AC 9). The dragun must be slain in order for a victim to be removed. Once this is done, 100 hit points damage must be inflicted on the (dead) draguns midsection, either by persons outside the dragun or by a swallowed victim, to free the captive. Note that a dead dragun floats easily and may be towed to land.Draguns also like to ram ships and other creatures that are floating on the surface of the water, using their snouts as batter- ing rams. A vessel of sailboat size or smaller is 90% likely to capsize if rammed; a ship the size of a sailed frigate would have a 5% chance of rolling over.Finally, draguns have a new body part: a gizzard that collects large stones and can expel them forcefully out the draguns open mouth. A fired stone weighs 4d4 lbs., has a 40-m range, and does 6d6 to what- ever it strikes. Draguns only fire stones when floating, not underwater. Because of this effect, and because of the blasting sound made when the stone is launched, the original name of dragon was modi- fied to its current form. A dragun has ld4 such stones which may be fired at any particular time.If a dragun senses any sort of poison gas on the waters surface, it immediately submerges and flees the area.",

	    "Description": "These vicious and destructive pests delight in ravaging fields cultivated by humans and humanoids. They attack anyone or anything that tries to interfere with them. They can bite, but more frequently they spit a glob of highly volatile, Greek-fire-like liquid that ignites on contact with open air. It hits any unob- structed target within 8 m and burns for 2d6 damage (unless the target is immune to heat and fire). It continues to burn for 5 Action Turns, doing 2d6 damage per turn, unless it is smothered out. To do this, the creature must roll on the ground for a full Action Turn; water (excepting full immer- sion) or cyrokinesis wont put out this fire. Firebugs can spit this liquid once every four Action Turns. The bodies of firebugs are also very hot, and any creature touch- ing them takes 1d4 damage  the extent of their heat generation powers.Most communities plagued by firebugs resign themselves to the loss of part of their grain. But firebugs are destructive by inclination as well as by ecological niche. They sometimes burn a field or attack a harmless passer-by out of sheer vicious- ness. They are also extraordinarily vindic- tive and typically respond to the loss of a fight by burning down the nearest village. Firebugs are also arrogant and seldom retreat from a fight. When they do flee, they are nearly impossible to catch, even though flightless, as they put up their force fields and hop 50 m in one jump, 5 times per Action Turn (ten times at fast speed).Firebugs are glossy black in color, with orange-red eyes like burning coals.",

They attack anyone or anything that tries to interfere with them. They can bite, but more frequently they spit a glob of highly volatile, Greek-fire-like liquid that ignites on contact with open air. It hits any unob- structed target within 8 m and burns for 2d6 damage (unless the target is immune to heat and fire). It continues to burn for 5 Action Turns, doing 2d6 damage per turn, unless it is smothered out. To do this, the creature must roll on the ground for a full Action Turn; water (excepting full immer- sion) or cyrokinesis wont put out this fire. Firebugs can spit this liquid once every four Action Turns. The bodies of firebugs are also very hot, and any creature touch- ing them takes 1d4 damage  the extent of their heat generation powers.Most communities plagued by firebugs resign themselves to the loss of part of their grain. But firebugs are destructive by inclination as well as by ecological niche. They sometimes burn a field or attack a harmless passer-by out of sheer vicious- ness. They are also extraordinarily vindic- tive and typically respond to the loss of a fight by burning down the nearest village. Firebugs are also arrogant and seldom retreat from a fight. When they do flee, they are nearly impossible to catch, even though flightless, as they put up their force fields and hop 50 m in one jump, 5 times per Action Turn (ten times at fast speed).Firebugs are glossy black in color, with orange-red eyes like burning coals.",

They are carnivorous in nature, and their forelegs have developed into broad wings, which they use to swoop down on their prey. Gliders cannot truly fly, but can descend upon a victim in a silent glide that adds a +2 bonus to oppo- nents chances of being surprised (even with heightened hearing). This glide can be extended for twice as far a distance as the gliders altitude at the time it takes off; e.g., a glider starting at a height of 20 m can glide down to prey on the ground 40 m away. Gliders climb extremely well using their back legs and winged forearms, each of which has a free claw useful only for hooking into tree bark to hold position. Gliders may be found at any altitude to which trees can grow. They avoid sailing out over bodies of water, as they cannot swim. Though of animal-like intelligence, gliders rarely bother creatures which possess considerable amounts of Tech II or Tech III equipment, perhaps because they dislike the smell produced by such items. Gliders often can be caught when young and raised as pets. Native jungle inhabit- ants have also lived in peace with gliders, feeding them on scraps and employing them as guards for villages. Gliders possess a low-grade form of radiation eyes (2d6 Intensity Level radia- tion per shot) that is emitted as beams of green laser light. They use this attack only against large creatures, and never against creatures they intend to eat.",

	    "Description": "During the twentieth century, the world heard tales of a large creature living within the unexplored regions of the Congo. The beast was said to be larger than an elephant, with a long, serpentine neck and small head. The natives called the creature mokele - mbembe, and scientists were able to film it in 1984. However, the beast was not proven to exist until a live one was cap- tured in 1989. These creatures were soon bred and cloned in captivity by the Ancients. In time, they were as common a sight at the zoo as were elephants them- selves.After the Social Wars, some of these creatures escaped from captivity to live in warm areas of the wilderness. At present, there are two species of this creature: one which has been mutated by the war, and one which has remained virtually unchanged over millennia. The pure- strain variety is described first.Mokele - mbembe, better known as the mokla, or baby bront, is a modern-day descendant of the brontosaurus, which was believed to have become extinct over 100 million years ago. The mokla weighs 9-15 tons and is a brownish-gray in color. Like many mutated reptiles, and just as scientists had suspected of dinosaurs for many years, moklas are warm-blooded. The mokla spends most of its time in the water, only coming to shore in the early morning and late evening to feed on plant life there. Otherwise, it eats coarse lake vegetation of many sorts.Moklas are very territorial and attack most creatures and boats which get too close to them. Any creatures that are 3 m in height or less which are stepped on by a mokla must (in addition to taking damage) make a CN x 3 check or fall unconscious for 1d4 hours, due to the beasts weight. Creatures which come too near to a wading mokla may be knocked aside by the charging creature and probably nipped with its flat (but painfully powerful) teeth. Moklas are not very bright.The mutated mokla has flippers in place of legs, and it strongly resembles the pre-historic plesiosaur. This flesh-eating creature feeds upon fish and small land-dwelling animals  like humans, humanoids, and so forth. The sea devil (as it is known) has been known to attack ships in order to devour the crew. It fires electrical bolts from its back tentacles after arising from the water before a vessel, attempting to sink the ship and gather up crewmen to eat. The back tentacles are highly flexible and can squeeze prey 3 m or smaller, doing 3d6 damage every Action Turn without requiring a roll to hit after the first successful hit. The electrical hands of power mutation can be used up to 4 times per day. Sea devils are completely immune to electrical effects. If a sea devil fires its hands of power at the surface of the sea or underwater, the damage done is reduced by half (round fractions up), but the electrical bolt is diffused over a spherical or hemispherical area with a radius of 3 m.During the summer mating season, both species of Moklas come ashore to lay their eggs in huge clutches, which are covered over with sand and left alone. The eggs hatch within a month, and the young moklas then stay with the nearest local herd of their own species. Moklas reach adulthood after a period of 10-15 years, and have a lifespan of over 500 years.",

The pure- strain variety is described first.Mokele - mbembe, better known as the mokla, or baby bront, is a modern-day descendant of the brontosaurus, which was believed to have become extinct over 100 million years ago. The mokla weighs 9-15 tons and is a brownish-gray in color. Like many mutated reptiles, and just as scientists had suspected of dinosaurs for many years, moklas are warm-blooded. The mokla spends most of its time in the water, only coming to shore in the early morning and late evening to feed on plant life there. Otherwise, it eats coarse lake vegetation of many sorts.Moklas are very territorial and attack most creatures and boats which get too close to them. Any creatures that are 3 m in height or less which are stepped on by a mokla must (in addition to taking damage) make a CN x 3 check or fall unconscious for 1d4 hours, due to the beasts weight. Creatures which come too near to a wading mokla may be knocked aside by the charging creature and probably nipped with its flat (but painfully powerful) teeth. Moklas are not very bright.The mutated mokla has flippers in place of legs, and it strongly resembles the pre-historic plesiosaur. This flesh-eating creature feeds upon fish and small land-dwelling animals  like humans, humanoids, and so forth. The sea devil (as it is known) has been known to attack ships in order to devour the crew. It fires electrical bolts from its back tentacles after arising from the water before a vessel, attempting to sink the ship and gather up crewmen to eat. The back tentacles are highly flexible and can squeeze prey 3 m or smaller, doing 3d6 damage every Action Turn without requiring a roll to hit after the first successful hit. The electrical hands of power mutation can be used up to 4 times per day. Sea devils are completely immune to electrical effects. If a sea devil fires its hands of power at the surface of the sea or underwater, the damage done is reduced by half (round fractions up), but the electrical bolt is diffused over a spherical or hemispherical area with a radius of 3 m.During the summer mating season, both species of Moklas come ashore to lay their eggs in huge clutches, which are covered over with sand and left alone. The eggs hatch within a month, and the young moklas then stay with the nearest local herd of their own species. Moklas reach adulthood after a period of 10-15 years, and have a lifespan of over 500 years.",

The beast was said to be larger than an elephant, with a long, serpentine neck and small head. The natives called the creature mokele - mbembe, and scientists were able to film it in 1984. However, the beast was not proven to exist until a live one was cap- tured in 1989. These creatures were soon bred and cloned in captivity by the Ancients.
