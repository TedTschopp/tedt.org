The medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for 24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks. Lack of energy after 24 hours will cause the android to hibernate until energy is restored.  ",

Thinkers are equipt with additional memory cells that allow them to record and capture the memories of the other Androids under their command.

Their coarse, heavy fur offers substantial protection from the elements.

Since they are not immune to this power themselves, they life leech each other as well as the enemy in combat. However, their life leeching of each other tends to cancel itself out, so ignore it in large fights. They have an unreasonable fear of flying creatures larger than 1 meter. ",

The pack is ruled by the alpha male, usually the ark with the most combat prowess. Other males will occasionally challenge the alpha male for the right to rule the pack. Sometimes a large pack will split, with part of it following a new alpha male and part of it staying with the old one. Arks fear all Tech Ill and IV artifacts, Ignore them if rolled as loot. However, Tech V and VI artifacts are worshipped as totems. The alpha male's first wife is charged with the care and transportation of the totems. They consider human hands to be a great delicacy.",

These massive beasts attack with a bite or with two kicks with their front legs. If attacked from the back, the brutorz can strike with its two back hooves. As an attack of last resort, the brutorz can trample with his four feet, causing 3d6 points of damage per hoof. (The GM should roll a 1d4 to determine how many hooves strike the opponent). The brutorz uses its intuition and telepathy to great advantage in combat. It always seems to know what an opponent is going to do before he does it. Frequently, brutorz taunt their enemies telepathically, trying to get them to break and run.",

They also lack the opposable manipulative digits needed to effectively use most technology. They live to run free and wild. If approached in a congenial manner, a brutorz may befriend a humanoid. Brutorz refuse to ally with humanoids and creatures who do not respect them. In a like manner, characters who plan to use a brutorz for their own means, without a thought toward the creature, can never hope to gain the brutorz as an ally. Brutorz willingly serve as draft animals, but refuse bits. bridles, or confining harnesses. They have a PS of 26 and can carry three normal men comfortably",

Unfortunately, the centisteed tends to trample any character or creature in its way. A successful attack means that the opponent has been knocked down and trampled with ld8 hooves. Each hoof does ld6 points of damage.   When the centisteed perceives danger, it immediately activates its force field generarion to ward off any possible damage. If a rider is currently on the beast, the force field actually raises the character off the beast's back, causing him to fall to the ground. Centisteeds have been known to trample each other in their panic to follow another centisteed on the run. Once they get going, they are almost impossible to catch.",

To add insult to injury, they eat twice as much as a normal animal their size. Herds of centisceeds can overgraze a pasture or meadow in record rime.

Their illusion generation is particularly strong. They can muster up visions of warbots or horrible monsters to scare their opponents off when they are at a combative disadvantage.

As a rule, they engage in combat only to acquire fun little baubles or in self-defense if cornered.",

Dabbers are intrigued with anything shiny. If they see another creature with an object, they approach cautiously, asking for it. If turned down nicely, the dabber leaves distraught, but understanding and accepting that the object is cherished by its current owner. If turned away cruelly, the dabber runs away. Often (90% of the time), the dabber then comes back with up to seven friends to take the object, and anything else that strikes his and their fancy.",

This allows them to escape both aquatic and landbased predators with ease. While in their bird form, fens can only fly at a movement rate of 24. They cannot accelerate to a higher speed as a normal bird can. It takes two rounds for a fen to change from one form to the other. When a fen shapechanges, equipment worn or carried does not become part of the bird form.",
      "Combat": "The fen has several natural attack forms at its disposal. While in its standard man-fish form, it can use its tail to slap an opponent standing behind or to its sides for 4d6 points of damage. It can also attack with any weapon it might have. The fen also can use any weapon that does not require fine manipulation, since its fingers are heavily webbed. In its bird form, the fen has three attack forms that it may direct at only one opponent during a sinle ground of  It can buffet with its wings for ld6 points of damage per wing, and it can peck with its beak for 2d6 points of damage.",
      "Society": "When in water, fens live in a society they call a lyceum. These lyceums swim together then whole lives, hunting during the early dawn and dusk. Basically omnivores, they eat both the flora and the fauna living at the sea or lake bottom. Fens are most prevalent in coastal areas and near large lakes. They are basically friendly and harmless, desiring only to live and let live.",

Settled grens still hunt and gather food, but they also tend any food plants which grow within their communities. They are careful to not harm the local ecology, trying to hvc in harmony with nature. Grens are also remarkably adept with animals and can train even the most stubborn of creatures, such as gators.

They have many human elements, including human-like hands on their wings and legs. These creatures usually wear clothing of some sort, and all wear at least a harness for weapons and equipment. The feathers of a hawkoid are predominantly brown, though they have white markings. Male hawkoids have beautiful white crescents on the undersides of their wings.

After that, they will usually stay in melee range of a chosen victim, fighting until one or the other is dead. If hard pressed, or if a group of prey seemingly has a powerful guardian, hawkoids will use their fear generation to drive the biggest threat away.

      "Combat": "Most hissers fight with clubs, sonic blast, and mental powers, although 20% of any group may have artifacts useful in combat and know how to use them (50% chance). They wear no armor, relying on their scales which are both hard and somewhat reflective of laser attacks. Half of all hisser patrols are accompanied by packs of trained squeekers. When accompanied by squeekers, a hisser's Stealth/R.U. drops to + 3. Hissers seldom attack alone and are never uncoordinated. They use their telepathy to execute precise maneuvers on the battlefield. Groups follow the orders of a leader who stays back from the battle, processing the thoughts of the others. If this commander is slain, there is a brief period ( 1d6 rounds) of disorganization before another hisser assumes control.",
      "Society": "Hissers are communal creatures. Each village (clutch) is ruled by a brood queen; nearly all the hissers of the village are her children. A nest queen may rule several villages which are composed of the offspring of herself and her children. Some hissers have formed nations, such as Huush, ruled by a single grand matriarch, known as the Great Mother of Us All. Hisser clutches are commonly located on high ground in the swamp. These are silent communities, except for the shrieks of their squeekers (raised for food and defense) since the man-snakes communicate entirely by telepathy. Many cannot even speak the most rudimentary languages. They have little attachment to artifacts, and tor an appropriate offer, they may sell one that they have. However, they do not trust or welcome outsiders.",

If they are successful in this attack, the molecular bonding of the metal item is altered, and it becomes like rubber-soft, stretchy, etc. Softened weapons and armor are all but useless; armor protection is negated and weapons do minimum damage.  Artifacts affected by this power no longer work.  Once the hoops' opponents are weakened in this manner, the hoops will proceed to enter melee.

Some pure white specimens have been seen, and green, blue, and pink individuals have been reported. Because of its chameleon power, a hopper can appear any color, and pastel-colored individuals are thought to be the results of the use of this ability.",
      "Combat": "Jackalopes are easily spooked unless they have been trained. A wild jackalope will attack anything which startles it, leaping at the offensive being (or object) and attempting to skewer it. A hopper will attack until it is hurt or otherwise frightened, such as by a loud noise or bright light. Once it has been frightened, a jackalope will hop away, often pausing after only one or two leaps, hunkering down and using its chameleon powN m11rntion to blend in with its surroundings. After blending in, the hopper tries to remain still until it believes that the source of the danger has left.",
      "Society": "Hoppers live in small family herds. A typical herd will consist of half adults and half young. If approached carefully, young jackalopes can be captured and trained. They will respond to only one master, and will still be easily spooked, though the presence of its master will raise a hopper's morale to 12. Jackalopes have very rough gaits, and a first-time rider is 80% likely to fall off and take 1d6 damage. A trained jackalope can carry one man-sized rider. A hopper with a rider can leap 10 meters, while an unencumbered hopper can leap as far as 15 meters.",

Although they are not very intelligent, they have reached the level of basic tool use and ran manipulate objects with their forepaws. The typical jaget is about a meter and a half long and weighs about 50 kilograms. A jaget's coat is stippled with dark stripes or spots over a yellowish base. Jagers prefer to travel on all fours and rarely wear anything or carry any objects or tools with them.",

A single human-sized opponent may be attacked by a lone jaget, but the savannah cats generally pursue smalkr and safer game. Jagets attack with two claws and a bite. If hunung together, the cats will often use their fear generation ability to drive prey towards the waiting pride. Jagets will attempt to use their intuition abilities in combat, gaining a + 2 THAC with a successful MP roll.",
      "Society": "The savannah cats are a wide-ranging race of hunters. Their intelligence is barely above the animal, and their lives revolve about the hunt. On the open plain, they usually live in family groups, which cooperate in the taking of prey and the defense of the group. Families are composed of a mated pair and one or two young or subadults. Their telepachic and intuitive abilities make it nearly impossible to surprise a group of cats, and also make the jagets skilled stalkers. Rarely, savannah cats are found wandering alone far from their homelands as the compan10ns of other creatures. Usually this is because, due to their substantial mental powers, jagets are often desired as followers or hirelings of other species. Jagets love bright, shiny objects and often slip into human camps to pilfer small artifacts.",

If forced into close melee combat they are essentially helpless. Lils often use tiny bows and arrows which do 1 point of damage if they hit successfully, but are dipped in intensity 15 sleep poison. This poison functions like paralytic poison, but never goes above Stage III. Stage III is \"asleep.\" It lasts an hour.",

They prefer to avoid contacts with other intelligent life, though they have been known to aid travelers who have not caused them any problems.

(The GM will need to remember to add to the XP Value for an orlen based on what artifacts it is carrying.)  Orlens prefer not to resolve problems by combat, but their size, strength, and armament ensure that they will not be caught unprepared when trouble comes looking for them. All orlens have a dual name, one for the left head and one for the right, such as Jan-Jane, Maura-Maureen, Tim-Tom, and KevinCalvin. When an orlen talks, the heads alternate speaking. ",

A typical orlen might carry two battle axes, a duralloy shield, a flintlock rifle, and an IR laser pistol, with a grenade or two thrown in for good measure. He would prefer to save the pistol for an emergency and use the flintlock from good cover, entering melee only when necessary. ",

The only orlen settlement of any significant size is Jainus, a fairly large city. Nomadic orlens are peaceful and gentle.

      "New Description": "The horse cacti is both a horse and cactus in name only. It is in actually a mobile cactus-like plant with behaviors in many ways resembling a horse. The plant has a large, horizontal central trunk which is supported by either four or six thick, stubby stalks which act as legs. These legs can propel the creature at great speeds. When the creature moves as quickly as it can, the action of the legs resembles a horse galloping.  The trunk extends into a thick, neck-like growth which the plant keeps elevated. At the end of the \"neck\" is a large assortment of leaves, roots and a clump of visual and olfactory organs. The leaves are used to gather sunlight, and the roots absorb liquids. The plant lowers its leaves and roots into pools of water when it drinks, an action that further resembles horse activity.  The pineto is much more cactus than horse. Every centimeter of its surface except for the leaves and roots is covered with long, sharp thorns. These thorns are usually 5 centimeters or so in lengrh Althcmgh sharp, they are somewhat flexible. These thorns give a pineto the appearance of having a hairy \"coat\" of thorns. The pinetos can be ridden, but a saddle of thick leather or other strong material is required. ",

Pinetos are extremely skittish and will bolt as soon as they perceive a threat. Only one of a pack has to become aware of the threat for everyone else to run.

In this respect, they have the same endurance and load-bearing qualities as a normal horse. ",

Podogs also have the unusual habit of baying as they attack, exactly imitating the cries or sounds their opponents may be making.

      "New Description": "These slow, but powerful, mutated oxen sport a tough cluster of horns , which angle generally forward from a bony plate across rhe crown of their heads . These horns form a partial carapace which protects the head and shoulders of the 1akux. Both male and female rakoxen posses their impressive horns . Young rakoxen begin growing the horns shortly after they are weaned . Adult rakoxen are about 2 meters tall at the shoulder. Although rakoxen are prone to panic and stampede, they are one of the most favored draft ammals m Meriga tor heavy labor. ",
      "Combat": "Rakoxen typically attack when they are spooked . The rakox will gore with its extraordinarily dense set of horns once per round and can charge if the target is more than 10 meters away. Rakoxen are exceptionally strong for their size (PS 24), giving them a bonus to damage and THAC in combat . A normal gore attack does 2d6 + 6 points of damage, while a charging attack does 4d6 + 6 points . ",
      "Society": "Rakoxen roam plains areas in large herds, grazing in groups of 20d 10. They are also found in many Tech Level II and III civilized areas, where they are used to pull wagons , plows, etc . Domestic rakoxen often have their horns saw down or capped by their owners. If sawn , the horns grow back in a season , requiring them to be cut again . Rakoxen are rarely ridden, since they tend to buck off riders.  In many places, older rakoxen are butchered for food. The meat is salty but otherwise palatable . The hide can be cured and used , but it is less serviceable than rog hide (see the \"Campaign \" chapter). The horns are hollowed out and made into musical instruments or storage containers , like gunpowder horns. ",

Serfs prefer mental combat tophysical combat (90% chance to attack with a mental attack).  They carry Tech Level I gear or higher if they have access.  A large Serf clan will organzie into a gridage of 10d10+50 troops led by a general who holds power with superior strength and cunning.",

      "Combat": "Serfs may make two claw attacks per or other type of attack.  They much prefer to engage in mental combat as opposed to physcial melee, and are 90% likely to do so.  Serfs commonly wear chain mail into battle and will fight with Tech III weapons, such as flintlock rifles.  They prefer the battle axe to sword in melce combat . ",
      "Society": "Serf, are either encontered as a small patrol, or may be found in large \"brigades\" of 5d20+50 individuals.  (a bridage will include 30% females and 30% children.) Serfs are militant, and prefer to dress in uniforms imitating ancient military and police designs, using these as clan symbols.  They are lifely to attack other brigades of serfs as they are other enemies.  Although they are a Tech Level II society, they readily use higher Tech Level equipment if shown how to operate it.  They are semi-nomadic, traveling when food in a partiiclar area becomes scarce, or whth the changing of seasons.  Once every few years, at the whim of the commander, a brigade travels to Gran Rads.  Once there it partipates in a festival of celebration with other serf bridages, holding fladitorial contests and swapping stories.  One serf clan, the Ministers of Thought, never leaves Gra Rad.  Its memvers believe that a serf leader called the Forstar will be born to their caln there, and will lead the serfs to create a great new Nation.",

      "New Description": "Looking like nothing more than grossly over-grown brownish or rust-colored rats, squeekers are easily identified by the shrill, painful cries they make in combat. Of course by this time the knowledge may come to late to save the intended victim.",
      "Combat": "Squeekers are pack animals, taking their prey by surrounding and overwhelming the target. Although vicious and quite capable of causing serious harm, squeekers have never been known for their courage.  When hunting, they single out weak or isolated targets that can easily be pulled down. Their most common hunting tactic is to stealthily surround the victimm and then rush out all at once, directing their sonic  blast attacks at the target.  If the civtim is still standing, they then attack with their bite, clinging to the animal until it is pulled down by the weight of their numbers.  If their dinner puts up strong resistance, they will circle it at a safe sitance, hoping to wear the target down by repeasted lunges.  If this does not work or help arrives, the squeekers flee in all directions. ",
      "Society": "Squeekers can be found in any terrain, but are most frequently encountered near settlements, lurking around garbage pits, or close to the lair of larger creatures.  They prey on passerby or scavenger food from the waste of others.  Their dens are usually a small complex of underground tunnels with several shambers and exists.  Squeekers can be domesticated somewhat and trained to severlike guard dogs and hunting animals.  This requires that they be trained from birth and even then can only be accomplished by those immune to their sonic blast mutation.  Hissers, in particular, keep pens of the animals for use both in the hunt and as food.  Indeed it is likely that the hisser immunity to sonic blasts developed slowly from a close relationship squeekers. ",

Attercops keep their prey as long as four days before they settle down to feed.  Becasuse of the creatures extraordinarily high Mental strength, the attercop is completly immune to all mental attacks except illusions.  These metnal attacks always suceed.  The attercop is a solitary hunter, allowing no othes of its kind witin its web or territory except during fall breeding, Female attercops deposit a half-meter diameter egg sac containing over 1000 young.  Blights, bloodbirds and carrins hunt these young attercops, likking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselvers.  The attercop's dlae resistant web sometimesa streches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in thie web need to makle a DC 5 strength check to escpae.  Any loot found in an attercop's web si emerely undigestible waste to the spider.  The lil, commonly take refuge within or behind attercop webs, although some fall prey to the spider. ",

The attercop is a solitary hunter, allowing no othes of its kind witin its web or territory except during fall breeding, Female attercops deposit a half-meter diameter egg sac containing over 1000 young.  Blights, bloodbirds and carrins hunt these young attercops, likking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselvers.  The attercop's dlae resistant web sometimesa streches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in thie web need to makle a DC 5 strength check to escpae.

Attack is made doubly difficult since the ground outside the camp is broken by jagged heaps of tailings.  Sarbises rely on trade for food, clothing, and other interesting goods. In exchange, they sell refined minerals- ingots of pig iron, copper, lead, tin, nickel; bags of sulphur, salt, and coal; whatever is useful from the earth. Because few others have the talent to dig and smelt these needed metals, sarbises are often left unmolested, even in the most hostile territories. Each camp is ruled by a strong man, a single leader who achieved his position through bullying and threat. All trading in the camp is controlled by the strong man or his minions.

They often make traps by digging undergound tunnel mazes, then making pits from the tunnel up to just below ground level.  These pits will not support the full weight of more than one human-sized creature and can drop members of a party of adventurers into the waiting claws of the ba'sleds.  In additino to their murderous claws they also have a sonic roar that can only be used once a day.  This attack does 1d5 damage to everything 15 feet in front of the roaring ba'sled.

This electrical discharge has a range of 3m from the tree's branches (5m from the trunk) and cause 4d10 points of base damage depending on the size of the tree (GM's decision).  The nep ep also has unique boring tendrils that only activate from the roots when and item with a lot of energy is dropped or left under the tree. The tree senses this power and bores up under and through the item, draining it of its energy. Therefore, there are usually some items of an electrical sort under the tree, usually buried beneath the fallen needles. The GM shoud determine these items randomly; the number of items found is 1d6. There is only a 25% chance any item is in useable shape, it will have a small hole bored into it and will always be drained of all power.

They can use four of their eight claws during any turn unless a character or creature makes the mistake of picking them up or turning them on their back, whereupon they can use all eight claws and their bite. Sheezu make wonderful pets and will never use their claws or bite and acid unless they feel extremely threatened. A qualified animal trainer can teach a sheezu a maximum of three commands or "tricks". ",

Sre'froth can blend in anywhere, crawl up any surface, and attach themselves on anything, even ceilings, by secreting a warm, sticky fluid as they move. ",
      "Behavior": "Thousands of transparent cilia on their bodies can "feel" body heat within a 50 foot radius, high heat can be felt at even greater distances. Sre'froth feed on animals they detect and come into contact with by wrapping around them, somewhat like plastic food wrap, and secreting strong acid around the prey. This usually dissolves their victims in a very short time and the ooze that is left over is absorbed into the sre'froth as straight protein. Their damage is considered to be intinsity 2d6+4 poison/ corrosive. Damage from this special type of attack is per turn of envelopment. The outer protein (clothing, hide, armor, etc.) must be eaten away before the character takes damage, unless a large portion of their body is exposed. Use the following chart to determine the time required by the sre'froth to consume different types of materials. Remember, any equipment the sre'froth comes into contact with will also be affected.  Cloth, Vegetation, Wood, Common Plastics, and Most synthetics survive for 1 turn.  Light metals and Heavy Plastics survive for two turns.  Heavy Metals and Plastic / metal alloys will survive for three turns.  Ceramics, Glass, Curalloy and certain other materials are not effected.  Sre'froth can only be hurt by poison, sonics, super-strong acids (Intensity 17+), fire, or drowning. Once they have climbed to a height of at least 10 feet they can launch themselves into a silent glide. The distance of the glide cannot exceed the height of their climb.   On the ground sre'froth are 95% undetectable by sight, when gliding this drops to 75%. They cannot sense body heat through ba'mutan hides and those characters protected by such can pass by sre'froth undetected. Ruins, caves, deep woods, buildings, and canyons are their favorite environs but they can be found anywhere. ",

The snake's ability to crawl anywhere is amazing (equal to its land speed on any surface but liquid, which reduces its speed by half). It prefers to climb up to a vantage point, usually about 3m above the surface and stay there indefinately until prey comes along. It is a chameleon and can match its surrounding coloration in 5 turns.",
      "Behavior": "The sucslith is able to fast for weeks, and can recycle its body fluids, negating the necessity of moving to find moisture. When attacking, the sucslith normally uses its web first. This web can work in one of two ways. Either it can be used to "catch" a small target (range 6m) or it can clog up a 3m area. This second type of web is suffciently thick enough to slow the movement of anyone in the affected area to half speed, except for the sucslith itself, which has no difficulty moving through its own or another suslith's web. The web has a strength of 20.  Oftentimes this intelligent snake will lay down its thick web underneath rotting floorboards or during a leaf fall, knowing it will be camouflaged. It will then perch at a vantage point above the webbed area and wait for a good sized victim to come along. Once the creature is slowed down by the ground web, the sucslith will cover it with another web, thus preventing its prey from seeing or using its appendages for combat. Then, the sucslith drops down on the hapless victim and enters the web, biting until the creature is dead. Unfortunately, sucsliths can be found anywhere, though they tend to avoid deserts and deathlands. ",

An aerosquid does not need to return to the water except to mate, so it may be encountered over all sorts of terrain in all climates but the coldest, as well as in the ocean depths. It has no need to sleep, although it will rest after a large meal. The small and completely aquatic infant form of the aerosquid is exceedingly vulnerable, so the adults are happily rare. A hungry aerosquid is an eating machine that will devour any form of animal life it can get its tentacles on. ",

      "Description": "or centuries, man- kind killed whales for his own needs or for sport. Though many people pro- tested these killings, they continued until only the smartest and strongest whales survived. With the ecological warfare of A.D. 2321 and the Apoca- lypse Week holocaust of the following year, it was assumed that all great whales had finally become extinct.\nHowever, the weapons used during the Social Wars had mutated the last remaining whales. The whales devel- oped powerful mutations, particularly the huge bladelike horns that were able to split even the largest ships in half. Remembering the treatment their race suffered at the hands of human beings, the blade whales began attacking all surface and undersea shipping they could find. As often as not, any crew- men cast into the sea by a blade whales attack would be eaten.\nWith the explosion of new mutated life in the oceans of the world, the blade whales have recovered their population and developed the roots of a world culture. They speak a complex ultrasonic language and are quite sociable. Once a year, blade whales gather in large herds to find mates and to discuss the activi- ties of the enemy surface dwellers who threaten the seas. These large herds contain about 40-60 individuals and stay together about 2 weeks, after which males and females pair off and go their separate ways. Blade whales have no fixed lairs and prefer to roam the seas freely.\nPrior to ramming a ship with its horn, a blade whale will activate its force field and have the force of the attack absorbed by its mutational protections. Damage equal to half the damage inflicted by the ramming blow will be inflicted on the blade whale. An injured whale will rarely continue an attack if the ship it struck has been destroyed or is sinking, though it may wait around to eat any survivors.",

(See A World Gone Mad, DRAGONissue #86, and A Field Guide To Lunar Mutants,\" DRAGON issue #87.) One of the mutant plants now found at Tycho Center is the so-called blaster blossom, a mutant orchid.\nThe blaster blossom is a reactive mutant, using its powers whenever it is touched. It has two attacks. The first is a spore cloud (treated as intensity 17 con- tact poison) that can slay victims with relative ease. This is fired whenever anything touches the blossom. The sec- ond attack is a actually a series of ran- dom energy attacks, fired whenever any metallic object (such as a robot) touches the plant. In a random manner, it will use one of the following attacks (roll\n1d4, one attack for one action turn):\n1) inflict 3d10 heat damage up to 3 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it; 2) fire an electrical bolt doing 2d26 damage up to 10 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it;\n3) fire an energy-draining bolt that instantly reduces all power cells within 5 m of the blossom to half energy; or,\n4) energy negation activated for 2-20 action turns, within a 15 m radius. If the spores ever kill the creature who touched the plant, they will grow in the dead body and become 1-3 new blaster blossoms within three days.",

      "Description": "These solitary, omnivo- rous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their height- ened taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat. They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).\nCrusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural ene- mies, and they are generally well- equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelli- gent creatures for a time. Crusteans appreciate company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves prop- erly. Even with long-time friends, a crus- tean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.\nA crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the oppo- nent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its symbiotic attach- ment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a physical strength of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum physical strength as noted above. This all assumes that the crus- tean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot  a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back. A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell\n(see below), but not until at least a week has passed.\nCrusteans can climb almost any verti- cal surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans light wave manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8-13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnera- ble while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water-breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and arti- facts, although they understand other creatures desire for them. A visible crustean looks like a brown-and-black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs and very large, powerful claws.",

      "Description": "Dracs are mutant, humanoid-shaped bats, with hollow bones and wings allowing them to fly normally. Their hands form part of their wings, so they cannot grasp an item and fly at the same time.\nAt night dracs go in search of mamma- lian prey, locating it from the air and surrounding their victims with fog using weather manipulation. They will then use infravision to aim sonic blasts at their victims while staying out of reach. If cornered, they will use their fear generation talent to defend themselves. They will flee rather than fight, if at all possible. After a victim is dead or dis- abled, dracs will land and use their hollow fangs to draw all the blood from the bodies, draining 1d4 hit points per action turn from living victims until twice the number of hit points a victim possesses has been drained (leaving the victim dead and without any blood).\nIt has been suspected that dracs were purposefully engineered by unknown beings, given their strong resemblance to the Ancients concept of vampires. Whether or not this is so remains to be seen. They do not appear to work for any higher power.\nDracs will usually not carry any tools or equipment, though a rare one, usu- ally the leader of a hunting pack, will have some equipment of Tech Level II. Dracs will only associate with their own kind. They will never become hirelings or followers.",

      "Description": "Encroaches are found wherever food to their liking (i.e., food prepared for humans) is available. They inhabit ruins instead of populated cities because of their talent for turning popu- lated cities into deserted ruins. They are prolific and voracious, and there is vir- tually no way to remove them from any sort of building. Furthermore, they frequently (GMs option) carry terrible diseases similar to those used by plants with the bacterial symbiosis mutation. Encroaches are very fast for their size, but they are unintelligent and generally do not move more than a few meters in a straight line. It is their habit to spread their kind by hitching rides on more mobile creatures when the local popula- tion reaches saturation point or the food supply is exhausted (which is virtually always).\nCharacter parties will encounter encroaches in abandoned storerooms and kitchens. The little insects will pour out of cupboards and containers and try to crawl all over the party. They can be outrun by creatures faster than themsel- ves who are not surprised. Otherwise, nothing will prevent each and every character from being literally covered with encroaches. Encroaches are immune to all forms of electromagnetic,\nthermal and nuclear attack (and to poison as well); only direct kinetic force (squashing) will harm them. It is futile\nattack them en masse, since each one that is killed will be replaced tenfold. Slapping, picking off and stomping, rolling on the ground, and similar strate- gies will kill all but 1-10 per character. These will remain on a characters per- son or in his or her gear until they are brought to a new environment (which need not be too far away from the old environment) where there is food. Meanwhile, the encroaches will devour any carried food supplies that are not perfectly sealed.\nAny character who has housed encroaches for an hour or more will have 1-10 encroach eggs laid on his or her person, clothes, or gear. These eggs will hatch in two days, producing new encroaches ready to mate and start a new colony. The eggs will inevitably be in an inaccessible location (if that is in any way possible), but they can be killed with a fresher or energy bath, or dis- posed of by leaving the gear behind.\nCities that have had experience with encroaches will ordinarily have devised horrible forms of execution specifically for any person or creature that infests the town with them.",

They have\nbeen known to save Pure Strain Humans and humanoids from drowning, though they are indifferent to the plight of mutated animals. Flipps have never joined the Zoopremists alliance.\nFlipps have been known to use their actual metamorphosis mutation to join parties of land-dwelling adventurers\nthat they have befriended. Of course, they must somehow acquire weapons and clothing on their own. If turned into their true form (as per the actual meta- morphis mutation), they will take 4 points of damage per round while out of water, until they are able to assume a new form or reach a water supply to keep their skins from drying out.\nOnly 2% of all flipps encountered will have the time manipulation mutation. For many years, flipps have been trying to improve their time-related abilities through selective breeding so that flipps with time manipulation can attempt a series of time jumps. to reach a period before the Social Wars. There they try to warn humans about the wars in an attempt to alter history, but apparently they are not being taken seriously since the future Gamma World still exists. Still, all the flipps with time manipula-\ntion will eventually try to go back and warn of the danger to come.",

They are intensely curious beings, and they love to collect small pieces of both metal and plastic, espe- cially if they are shiny, have strange shapes, or are in some other way attrac- tive to the garrel. Because of this, gar- rels often unwittingly have one or two small artifacts in their possession, mak- ing them targets for treasure hunters\n(especially for Archivists). However, it is unlikely that the garrels need fear extinction at the hands of such as these.\nWhen not gathering food, a garrel is always on the lookout for new items to add to its collection. Anyone who camps in or near a forest inhabited by garrels can expect at least one of these creatures to be lurking nearby, just out of sight. The garrel will wait until it sees something attractive thats also unguarded. It will then use its teleport object ability to gain possession of the item and will then return to its lair, most often a hollow tree trunk or a small burrow, where the garrel will put the item with the others it has accumulated.\nIf a garrel is attacked, either by a predator or by angry beings whose equipment has been borrowed,\" its first reaction will be to flee, holding any treasures it has acquired for as long as it can, using its speed, agility, tree-climbing skills, and any available foliage to speed its escape. Garrels prefer forests with a thick blanket of undergrowth so that they can lose pursuit with a minimum of effort. During the chase, the garrel will trust its displacement ability to send it to safety if it is at any time in imminent danger of being killed.\nIf displacement cannot be used, the garrel will then use its stunning force to buy time. Garrels are immune to the effects of another garrels stunning force attack. If both of the previous powers have been used and the garrel is still in danger, it will then attack its pursuer, biting with its sharp teeth and never relenting.",

      "Description": "There is a 20% chance that players have not encountered 1 tree, but 1d20 trees. The harmony tree is extremely handsome  graceful and straight, with large yellow flowers, red plumlike fruit, and lush, glossy green leaves the year around. Any creature with intelligence between 2 and 16 (not including robots or androids, but includ- ing cyborgs) that comes within 20 m of a harmony tree must defend vs. a mental attack or become psychologically depen- dent on the tree. Victims are overcome with a feeling of great peace and har- mony, and will be totally unwilling to leave the euphoric atmosphere of the tree or see it harmed in any way. Vic-ims must be killed, stunned, or other- wise subdued if they are to be removed from the trees influence. Once out of range, the victim will recover his or her normal senses. However, victims of a harmony tree are immune to fear gener- ation, mental control, and empathy while under the trees control.\nCreatures under a harmony trees control feel no need to eat, and they would shudder at the mere idea of hurt- ing any living thing, especially the tree itself. They will not even fight to defend themselves if attacked (but see below). However, if a victim is attacked and hurt, the tree must try to regain control (a mental attack at + 2); if the victim is brought to 10% of his or her hit points, the tree may attack again at no bonus. If this attempt to control the victim fails, the victim is free to escape.\nIf anyone tries to harm the tree, all its victims will attack the offender in a frenzy of blind hatred, using the most effective available attack form at + 4 to hit. In this frenzy, victims will ignore damage to themselves, and can be injured and killed without the tree hav- ing to renew its control over them at all. Victims of a harmony tree that are not attacked and killed will slowly, happily starve to death.\nA harmony tree will keep an entou- rage of as many creatures as possible, since this is its only means of defense. These creatures are often quite varied and even naturally hostile to each other, but they will lie down lovingly together at the base of the harmony tree (this being one way to identify the latter). If a victim is killed or starves to death, the tree will cause the survivors to hide the corpse by burying it or throwing it as far as possible, according to their abili- ties. However, it will have them keep any weapons on the body, as well as any weapons they have themselves, as the guardians may be called upon to use these in defense of the tree. Victims will hide weapons among the branches of the tree or play with them peacefully until someone attacks the tree. In gen- eral, the tree uses the senses of its vic- tims, but they are guided entirely by its intelligence, which may be higher or lower than their own.\nIn any harmony tree encounter, the GM should decide what sort of entou- rage the tree should have, based on the size, status, and overall power of the player character party. There may be nothing but a few dead bodies under the tree, or up to a dozen assorted creatures including a few humans or humanoids with artifacts. Something should almost always be under a harmony tree, since no one can bury the last victims if they all die.\nThe fruit of the harmony tree is inten- sity 7 slow poison. If the tree captures a victim too small to use in its defense (5 HD or less), it may force the victim to eat a fruit and then walk or fly away at normal speed to die within 1-3 hours, starting a new tree. Even after it leaves the 20 m range of the tree, the victim will not regain its senses unless it sur- vives the poisoning, being overcome with misery at having been cast out. This is the way in which the harmony tree propogates itself. A free-willed character that eats a ripe harmony fruit (indistinguishable from an unripe one) will gain four points of mental strength for one hour. Eating unripe harmony fruit will not increase a characters men- tal strength. At any given time, 10% of the fruit on a harmony tree will be ripe. All of it will be poisonous, and of course a character must survive the poison to gain the mental strength. The poisonous effects of all harmony fruit eaten in one day are cumulative, so two harmony fruit will act as intensity 14 poison.",

Being clumsy and slow on land, the hogart prefers to stay aloft and avoids contact with almost all other creatures.\nThe hogart is capable of creating sonic booms from snapping its wings. Sonic boom generation is a conscious physical mutation, useable three times per day, and it will affect all those within a 20-m radius in front of the hogart. The sonic boom blast causes 6d6 points damage, and all those who fail a constitution check (CON x 5) will become deaf for 24 hours. A hogart will only attack out of hunger or if attacked first.\nThe hogart has learned to use its heightened vision to scan intelligent parties carefully from high altitudes, thus avoiding the more dangerous oppo- nents. If necessary, a hogart will delay attacking an enemy until the opponent is engaged in combat with another crea- ture or until the opponent is asleep. The hogart will then drop out of the sky like a rock, coming to a sudden halt directly over the victim as it snaps its wings and generates the sonic boom. It can then hover and continue to generate the\nsonic boom every action turn thereafter. Hogarts can sometimes (if carefully approached) serve as guides, for they\nknow the territory around their snowy lairs very well. Hogarts do not like yexils for some reason, and often attempt to blast them out of the sky.\nHogarts have snow-white scaly skin and feathered wings, with a coarse blue mane running from the backs of their heads to their tails. Their wing feathers are highly prized for decorative pur- poses, and four sacks full of feathers (as much as can be taken from a hogart) would be worth about 150 gold pieces.",

Luckily, they arent encountered often, for these clever and malicious creatures enjoy tricking parties of adventurers. They will meet adventurers in their Pure Strain Human form and try to join the adventurers. If they gain the partys trust, they will carefully work their way into positions in which they can success- fully slay as many Pure Strain Humans as possible, as they consider the meat a delicacy.\nFor some unknown reason, howlers are highly allergic to silver metal. If they are merely touched by silver, it will cause 1 point of damage per action turn to them. A weapon made of silver will do double normal damage if it hits a howler. Any damage caused by silver or silver weapons cannot be regenerated or healed by these creatures. Howlers are actually able to smell silver.\nBoth howlers and dracs (q.v.) are believed to have been purposefully bred by unknown agencies or beings for unknown reasons. Howlers resemble the Ancients concept of werewolves in many ways.\nHowlers will usually possess several items of Tech Level II. They will only associate with other mutant animals, and are quite rare at present.",

Jestes are curious by nature, and can often be coaxed into joining a party of adventurers. They will always be loyal companions, though they will still joke around when the party is not in a dangerous situation. Jestes encountered in the wild will have 1-4 items of Tech Level II. These will be items that they are able to handle with ease (for example, pistols instead of rifles).\nJestes enjoy the company of friendly mutant animals, grens, and wardents.

      "Description": "The juggernaut is a large rhinoceros with bright red eyes and armor-like skin of a metallic, blue-black color. The juggernaut is not a carnivore, but is still dangerous as it may charge if irritated by some move- ment within 100 m of its eyes (its effec- tive visual range). A juggernaut will attack first by charging, and then by standing and goring one or two oppo- nents. A charging juggernaut can cover an amazing distance in one action turn (60 m), and a standing juggernaut can gore twice in a round. However, its weak eyesight makes it -4 to hit at all times, although it has good senses of hearing and smell. An attacking jugger- naut will use its radiation eyes (intensity\n3d4) while goring if it is really angry (GMs option, based on the situation). One charge will often satisfy a jugger- naut, especially if its target falls down and plays dead. However, a wounded juggernaut will attack anything in range at random (including trees). Juggernauts are totally immune to poison and radia- tion.\nThough juggernauts are found only in North America, they were not originally native to this land. They are descended from zoo specimens that escaped confinement during the Social Wars.",

      "Description": "Marloks look like Pure Strain Humans, except for their extremely pale skin and their large, light-sensitive eyes, both of which are the result of their subterranean exist- ence. Why those humans who were the marloks ancestors went underground in the first place is not clear, though it is thought they might have been refugees from the devastation during the Social Wars, or even command personnel con- trolling the war from deep below the earth. No matter what their origins, marloks are one of the most successful of the various subterranean races and are widespread, often migrating from one underground complex to another by traveling at night on the surface.\nMarloks lead a nomadic life while underground, traveling various tunnels, caverns, and other passageways in small, close-knit groups. Because of the large number of subterranean preda- tors, they seldom stay in any one place for more than a few days. Marloks often use tunnels to the surface to send out nighttime foraging parties to collect whatever edible plants and animals they can get. These are used to supplement the usual marlok diet of roots and fungi. However, since marloks do not recog- nize the rights of surface people, they often are not above raiding a nearby village for foodstuffs, though some groups have been able to establish mutual trade arrangements in which the marloks receive food for metals and an occasional artifact or two.\nMarloks have developed several powers to aid in underground survival. Their directional sense helps individuals to find their way back to their clan if separated, and this ability also helps in navigating the maze of underground passageways. Heightened precision lets them test the stability of tunnels and caves before entering them. Their heightened hearing, besides detecting the approach of enemies, can also detect the sounds of settling and potential collapse in tunnel systems. Telekinesis is often used to move obstructions from their path; if objects do not prove easily movable, molecular disruption can usu- ally reduce them to more manageable size. Should the exercise of the former two abilities be beyond the range of any one individual, then their mass mind can increase their power output. The marlok racial ability of mass mind is better than the type usually encoun- tered, in that the base chance of any of the participants dying is only 1% ( + 1% for each minute of contact). All involved in the mass mind share a weak tele- pathic link while in contact, between those in the link who are touching.",

      "Description": "Vast tracts of North Americas wild forests were destroyed in the years prior to the Social Wars, and only a few large wildlife preserves were in existence before the start of the Social Wars. Unknown to mankind, these areas also served as the homelands of the mountain men, formerly known as sas- quatches (or now squatches). Semi- intelligent apelike creatures, the mountain men knew they had to avoid humans or perish. Though they were sometimes spotted by trappers or hunters, little hard evidence of their existence was produced.\nFollowing the Social Wars and the disruption of civilization, the mountain men left their forests and began to spread through the North American west. Bigger and stronger than before, they have also become more aggressive, especially against Pure Strain Humans. Mountain men attack with their fists, refusing to use any technological items or tools. If one hits an opponent with both fists, he can hug the victim for an additional 1d8 points of damage, and he will also attempt to bite the victim and inject intensity 5 poison into the oppo- nents bloodstream. Only those who are the same size as or smaller than a moun- tain man may be hugged.\nMountain men are also able to throw stones at opponents, hurling rocks up to .5 m diameter as far as 10 m. The largest rocks cause 3d10 points damage (weap- ons class 9). Mountain men can catch similar missiles, if they see them coming first.\nMountain men live in caves, forming loose family groups of 2d6 adults with 1d4 children. Females and males appear in equal numbers. Animal skins are used to cover cave entrances and to make beds. A fire is usually kept burning near the cave entrance to ward off animals and to cook food.\nFemales often pick berries and dig for roots to get food for the family group, while males hunt whatever herbivorous creatures live nearby. If a mountain man tribe feels it necessary, they will raid a humanoid village for food  Pure Strain Human villages are attacked with the intent to destroy them completely.\nMountain men do not like machines, robots, or any mechanical devices. Even before the war, their ancestors were known to have destroyed construction vehicles and automobiles. Wardents and mountain men frequently trade with each other, and a strong friendship exists between the two races.\nMountain men appear to be large, brown, gorilla-like beings who walk erect. Their thick fur keeps out the cold and serves as their only body armor.",

      "Description": "Sifoners are a special species of mutant lizard that feed off the mental energy given off by intelligent mammals, including Pure Strain Humans and humanoids. Mutant creatures will be attacked before unmutated ones, as they produce more mental energy from their mutations.\nA sifoner possesses hundreds of tiny suction cups on its feet which enable it to climb across walls, ceilings, and so forth without fear of falling. It has learned to position itself over well- traveled areas, blending in with the surrounding scenery to await a chance to jump on a passing victim. It will make four immediate attacks against a victim when it leaps (one for each clawed foot); if at least one of the attacks hits, the sifoner may activate its symbiotic attach- ment power. Any claw that hits need not roll to strike again, as it will be securely fastened to the victim and can continue to do damage every action turn thereaf- ter. Any claw that missed may attempt to strike again each action turn until it grabs the victim and remains attached.\nA sifoners symbiotic attachment power will only work against one per- son at a time, but if the victim dies, the sifoner is unaffected. Once the attach- ment is made successfully, the victim is drained of one intelligence point per turn afterwards, until an intelligence of 1 is reached and the victim becomes animal-like in behavior. At this point, the sifoner will leave the victim. Once drained, a victim will slowly begin to recover lost intelligence points at a rate of 1 point per day. No conscious or men- tal mutations of any sort may be used while the victim is recovering, until full intelligence is again restored. A sifoner can command its victim to take simple actions necessary to help the sifoner escape from those trying to slay it.\nSifoners are usually encountered sin- gly, though pairs may be seen during mating season (which comes in the spring, once every decade). Sifoners lair in ground burrows or under rocky over- hangs, and they have learned to use branches, leaves, and stones to hide their lairs from view. Eggs will be present in a lair in late spring 50% of the time. Young sifoners grow to adult- hood in 4-5 months. Sifoners do not breed or live long in captivity, and are thus useless as guardians.",

It now has hundreds of thorn- pods, each .5 m across, growing all over its surface. Its root system has adapted to feed off metal of all types, and it is able to absorb any moisture in the air as nourishment.\nThe spitter evolved so that it reacts to moving metal of any type within a 20-m radius. Whenever the spitter detects a metallic object coming into range, it will shoot 1d6 of its pods at the object. The pods release a special corrosive acid upon striking the target that does 3d6 of damage normally, adding an extra 3d6 damage to force fields and metal of any type. Each of these pods has an acid- proof seed that will grow if left undis- turbed in the acidic residue of a destroyed robot or vehicle. If less than one kilogram of metal is detected, the spitter will only shoot one pod.",
