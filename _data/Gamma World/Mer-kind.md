description: Mer-kind are half-man, half-fish beings (human torso with a fish tail)
  who live in harmony with most creatures of the ocean. They usually reside in small
  undersea communities and will sometimes use trained Horsy as mounts. They will generally
  help any creature they come across who appears to be in trouble. Of the many intelligent
  beings living in the strange seas of Gamma World, they are perhaps the most noble.
  They are able to survive for short periods of time above the surface.
