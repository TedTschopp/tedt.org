description: Diggers are a civilized breed of mutant armadillo. They live in loose
  tribal communities of burrows and stone structures. They are posessed of a full
  carapace, as well as burrowing claws.  Digger society is ruled by Shamans.  Most
  settlements of these creatures will pay nearby towns of humans or Kaiute packs,
  whoever's stronger, with liquor and gunpowder for protection, so they can tend their
  roots in peace. If they arm themselvs at all it's usually with some form of rifle,
  musket, or shotgun if they gan get it. They use their claws if they can' t.

behavior: They are posessed of a full carapace, as well as burrowing claws that allow
  them to do 1d10 per hit in combat and burrow up to 3 feet a round. These creatures
  are totally immune to telepathic Mental Attacks. Digger society is ruled by Shamans,
  who each have 1d4-1 Mental Mutations. They are skilled herbalists, and are the source
  of many of the folk medicines, such as Medicine Paints (a.k.a. Neutralizing Pigments),
  available in the New West. They also make moonshine vodka and know the secret of
  gunpowder. Diggers are generally non- violent, but will fight if cornered.
