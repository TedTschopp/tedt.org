description: This brilliantly striped insect is 5m long, 2m wide, and 1.75 meters
  thick. It's bright yellow, two-meter long antennae are the only sensory organs it
  has.
equipment: ''
reactions: ''
behavior: It cannot be affected by gas, poison, sonics, etc. The quanakus can withdraw
  its legs and antennae into its shell and lower sections of its carapace into place,
  covering its extremities. When this is done, the insect increases its AC by 4. The
  quanakus can be trained to go into it's barricade" mode on command. The rider can
  then use it as hard cover, affecting his armor class as a shield (+1 AC). This long
  beast can carry up to four passengers and quite a lot of cargo  at one time. It
  can travel over most terrain, including up formidable cliffs, and is too dumb to
  bolt. It can be found in most terrains and is quite dangerous in the wild.
