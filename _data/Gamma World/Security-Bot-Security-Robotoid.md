  and during normal business hours.  During an emergency or after hours, only a supervisor's
  card can command it.  It is required to obey any emergency civil authority card
  , so long as it does not violate mission statement.The owning corporateion has both
  maintenance and programmers CardsIt is rumored that some corporations unlawfully
  altered the Equipment and mission statements of some of their security robots.  Security
  robots reat security cards in the sam maner as civil Authority Cards.

  or entering restricted areas.  They have command circuits that allow them to summon
  medical robots and engineering robots as necessary. Security robots wander the grounds
  and buildings of the corporation that owns them.  They have very keen sensors, and
  rarely miss any telltale signs of intruders.  Upon spotting an unauthorized activity,
  this robot always gives warning before attacking.  Even then , it only uses the
  minimal force necessary to prefent the crime.  It immediately radios the police
  and other security robots upon spotting a problem.  Animals are kept out of buildings,
  but otherwize ignored.  Plants are ignored altogether.
