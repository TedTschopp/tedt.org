description: Perhaps the most hideous of all of the Gamma World creatures, the Vath
  are twisted mutant descendents of the vampire bat. They are much deadlier than their
  ancestors and a meter in size. The most striking feature this mutant possesses is
  its two heads (Multiple Body Parts). Each of the Vath's heads is connected to its
  body by a long, thin, muscular neck, 15cm in length. Both heads and faces are similarly
  shaped (just like a vampire bat's face) but one head is colored bright crimson and
  the other a ruddy brown. The bright red face has poisoned fangs (inflicting 2d6
  damage and causing 2d4+5 intensity poison damage) while the other has hollowed fangs
  for sucking blood (2d8 points of damage). This bat continually seeks out the blood
  of other creatures in order to get its essential nourishment. The body and wings
  of the mutated bat are colored a golden brown speckled with black. Like other bats,
  Vath travel and maneuver through the use of sonar. When encountering opponents,
  these creatures prefer using their Beguiling. Only in desperate situations will
  the Vath use their Life Leech mutation. The hard rubbery skin of the Vath slows
  its air speed by 25% when the weather gets cold (Skin Structure Change). These creatures
  make their homes in caves and other dark places, although unlike their ancestors,
  they travel during the day as well as night.
