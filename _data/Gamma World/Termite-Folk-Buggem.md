description: "It is rumored that the Buggers appeared even before the onset of The\
  \ Shadow Years, having been spawned decades earlier by the radioactive fallout of\
  \ an atomic bomb test. In appearance, these malevolent creatures have the synthesized\
  \ features of a man and a gargantuan insect. The creatures are bipedal (standing\
  \ between 150-200 centimeters) and have only two arms. Their bloated abdomen and\
  \ thorax are connected to a large head complete with long, fern-like antennae and\
  \ broad mandibles.When attacking, Buggers either strike with their two claws and\
  \ bite for 1-6, 1-6, and 1-10 points respectively or they can use a crude weapon\
  \ such as an axe, sword, or mace. When using a weapon the creatures can also bite.These\
  \ termite men live within nests made up of a myriad of burrowed passages and chambers.\
  \ Due to the lack of light in the Buggem nests, the creatures hove developed heightened\
  \ senses that allow the Buggers to see in the dark. Buggem nests ore found in almost\
  \ all climes and are easily recognizable by the prominent mound of dirt formed over\
  \ the opening into their chambers. Like any of their smaller relations these termite\
  \ creatures are primarily fungus eaters, raising their own food supply deep within\
  \ their dark burrows in strange fungus gardens.Although they prefer to remain in\
  \ their nests, Buggers must occasionally venture outside to get hosts for their\
  \ parasitic infants. These hosts ore invariably humanoid and always perish during\
  \ the eventual hatching of the young. In a world of far more dangerous creatures,\
  \ the Buggem species survives partially due to two unique mutations that occur occasionally\
  \ among their kind. Appearing in one creature out of twenty, the Buggers' first\
  \ mutation is that of gas generation. Several different types of gas are possible\
  \ with varying probability of appearance. The types and associated probability are:\
  \  1-40 Opaque Gas, 42-80 Caustic Gas, 81-100 Poison Gas Each mutated Buggem is\
  \ able to generate only one type of gas, and may use this ability only three times\
  \ per day. All Buggers are immune to any of the gases` effects.The second mutation\
  \ is more rare, occurring in only 1% of the species. The abnormality causes the\
  \ termite man's size and strength to decrease, but, in return the Creature gains\
  \ greater dexterity, heightened   , and telepathic ability. These telepaths are\
  \ able to communicate with any member of their hive regardless of distance or physical\
  \ obstruction. They direct all important actions taken in their nests, allowing\
  \ a degree of intelligence to enter into their lesser brothers' actions. In addition.\
  \ these biological freaks use archaic weaponry such as blasters, lasers, and death\
  \ roy projectors whenever such advanced weapons ore available."
