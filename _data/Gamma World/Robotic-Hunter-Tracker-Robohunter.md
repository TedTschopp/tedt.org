description: 'The Robohunter was specifically constructed for several track- ing purposes,
  including the ability to fol- low escaping creatures over any type of terrain. The
  Robohunter was designed for use with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow
  era, but is now normally controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals
  (making them very trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the
  few remaining resistant animal population (those creatures that were not affected
  by the radiation). It was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the
  needed function. Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much
  modified by post-holocaust humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far
  beyond what would logi- cally be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can
  never harm crea- tures of Pure Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with
  non-obvious physical mutations), but always tries to kill or capture any creatures
  of mutated stock, as well as all characters that have muta- tions which obviously
  separate them from pure stock. The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and
  anything that attacks it (including PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms.
  Due to its pro- gramming, the Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes
  until whatever current mission it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears
  as a massive, large-proportioned humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively
  hidden by a holographic projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental
  coloring as if it had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings
  cover the outside of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp
  duralloy shards that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other
  units in the Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its
  weaponry simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed
  in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and their
  functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed
  in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged by
  an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided
  for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be charged
  to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable is fired
  at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims skin.
  The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to wrap around
  a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of 21 or greater
  to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage), another replaces
  it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati- cally. The
  weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter are
  separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16 and a
  range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at crea- tures.
  These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage from bleeding
  per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area is treated. The
  razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered by two solar energy
  cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head of the Robohunter
  has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached to one side is a
  flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10 hp damage and has
  enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire spreading to flammable
  materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet also has an optical
  weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive energy in any direction
  the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect as the mutation radiation
  eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation like the mutation. This
  attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy cell source is drained
  and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from the back of the Robohunter,
  allowing it to attack in all directions at once in hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles
  do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10
  meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored in the lower chest area of the Robohunter
  are three magnetic seal nets that are the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter.
  The Robohunter also has a needler pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful
  sleeping serum. This serum will cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action
  turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol
  is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle.
  This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10
  hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and the weapon
  has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three hydro- gen energy
  cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built into the left arm
  of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter can utilize a modern
  spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does 3d8 hp damage. The device
  has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong line that allows the Robohunter
  to automatically retrieve its spears, as well as dead creatures. The Robohunter
  is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen energy cell that allows 10 shots.
  This weapon can only be used in underwater environments and is part of the right
  arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual defenses. A magnetic field
  can be created that can either be used to repel or attract small metallic objects
  near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings, these small objects may be
  retained only if the being holding them has a strength of 18 or greater. If this
  field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed buildings, then
  the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage unless braced
  against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto- matically to
  make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field also allows
  the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials that can
  be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn. This field
  has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters can also
  be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis rod. The
  field also causes its victim(s) to fall into unconsciousness and not be awakened
  for 4d4 hours. Plants are not affected by this field, but beings with organic brains
  are.An energy field that surrounds the Ro- bohunters surface at a 2-centimeter-wide
  layer does 3d10 hp damage to characters coming into contact with it. The entire
  duralloy surface of the Robohunter is covered in sharp metallic protrusions, similar
  to a sharks rough skin (only magni- fied in effect). Individuals pressed against
  this surface or held there by the robot suffer 2d4 hp damage. The Robohunter may
  also attempt to bear-hug any crea- ture. This hug requires two consecutive successful
  fist attacks. Trapped characters take 6d4 hp damage per action turn until dead or
  rescued.Various equipment and items used for other purposes of tracking and hunting
  are also present in the Robohunters con- struction. Although not originally planned
  for offensive use, some of the devices can cause damage. Acid spray was used to
  destroy the remains of a hunted animal; it can be fired up to 10 meters away and
  causes 1d8 hp damage per turn until washed away or neutralized. The Robo- hunter
  has enough acid for 20 spray at- tacks. Two vibro saws used for cutting through
  dense underbrush can be used to attack and have abilities similar to the vibro blade.
  Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter is also equipped with herbicides,
  fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers
  to help in the pursuit of deadly game. A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures
  and large obstructions does 8d6 hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting
  through duralloy walls in 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter
  to pass through). The sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor
  beam capa- ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The
  Robohunter has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures
  up to 100 meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting
  beings. There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal
  medi-kit on mutated animals). The bot is sealed for underwater use and is able to
  move 50 meters per turn in this environment. The Robohunter is also able to skim
  across the surface of land with the aid of anti-grav pods. The Robohunter can obtain
  only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and defenses normally
  while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable of changing their structure
  to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter can resemble the following
  robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot, Medical Robot, Security
  Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action turns of inactivity,
  and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed appearance. The Robohunter
  has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control other robots as if it had
  a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive changing ability described
  above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions made by Knights of Genetic
  Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable of sustaining 40 hp damage
  before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp damage before being useless.
  A fist strike from a Robohunter does 4d6 hp damage.'

  \ turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The\
  \ pistol is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic\
  \ rifle. This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that\
  \ do 10d10 hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and\
  \ the weapon has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three\
  \ hydro- gen energy cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built\
  \ into the left arm of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter\
  \ can utilize a modern spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does\
  \ 3d8 hp damage. The device has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong\
  \ line that allows the Robohunter to automatically retrieve its spears, as well\
  \ as dead creatures. The Robohunter is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen\
  \ energy cell that allows 10 shots. This weapon can only be used in underwater environments\
  \ and is part of the right arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual\
  \ defenses. A magnetic field can be created that can either be used to repel or\
  \ attract small metallic objects near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings,\
  \ these small objects may be retained only if the being holding them has a strength\
  \ of 18 or greater. If this field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed\
  \ buildings, then the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage\
  \ unless braced against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto-\
  \ matically to make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field\
  \ also allows the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials\
  \ that can be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn.\
  \ This field has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters\
  \ can also be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis\
  \ rod. The field also causes its victim(s) to fall into unconsciousness and not\
  \ be awakened for 4d4 hours. Plants are not affected by this field, but beings with\
  \ organic brains are.An energy field that surrounds the Ro- bohunters surface at\
  \ a 2-centimeter-wide layer does 3d10 hp damage to characters coming into contact\
  \ with it. The entire duralloy surface of the Robohunter is covered in sharp metallic\
  \ protrusions, similar to a sharks rough skin (only magni- fied in effect). Individuals\
  \ pressed against this surface or held there by the robot suffer 2d4 hp damage.\
  \ The Robohunter may also attempt to bear-hug any crea- ture. This hug requires\
  \ two consecutive successful fist attacks. Trapped characters take 6d4 hp damage\
  \ per action turn until dead or rescued.Various equipment and items used for other\
  \ purposes of tracking and hunting are also present in the Robohunters con- struction.\
  \ Although not originally planned for offensive use, some of the devices can cause\
  \ damage. Acid spray was used to destroy the remains of a hunted animal; it can\
  \ be fired up to 10 meters away and causes 1d8 hp damage per turn until washed away\
  \ or neutralized. The Robo- hunter has enough acid for 20 spray at- tacks. Two vibro\
  \ saws used for cutting through dense underbrush can be used to attack and have\
  \ abilities similar to the vibro blade. Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter\
  \ is also equipped with herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in\
  \ the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers to help in the pursuit of deadly game.\
  \ A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures and large obstructions does 8d6\
  \ hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting through duralloy walls in\
  \ 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter to pass through). The\
  \ sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor beam capa-\
  \ ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The Robohunter\
  \ has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures up to 100\
  \ meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting beings.\
  \ There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal\
  \ medi-kit on mutated animals). The bot is sealed for underwater use and is able\
  \ to move 50 meters per turn in this environment. The Robohunter is also able to\
  \ skim across the surface of land with the aid of anti-grav pods. The Robohunter\
  \ can obtain only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and\
  \ defenses normally while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable\
  \ of changing their structure to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter\
  \ can resemble the following robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot,\
  \ Medical Robot, Security Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action\
  \ turns of inactivity, and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed\
  \ appearance. The Robohunter has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control\
  \ other robots as if it had a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive\
  \ changing ability described above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions\
  \ made by Knights of Genetic Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable\
  \ of sustaining 40 hp damage before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp\
  \ damage before being useless. A fist strike from a Robohunter does 4d6 hp damage."
players: "Robohunter; 'Robotic Hunter/Tracker';Description: The Robohunter was specifically\
  \ constructed for several track- ing purposes, including the ability to fol- low\
  \ escaping creatures over any type of terrain. The Robohunter was designed for use\
  \ with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow era, but is now normally\
  \ controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals (making them very\
  \ trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the few remaining resistant\
  \ animal population (those creatures that were not affected by the radiation). It\
  \ was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the needed function.\
  \ Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much modified by post-holocaust\
  \ humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far beyond what would logi- cally\
  \ be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can never harm crea- tures of Pure\
  \ Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with non-obvious physical mutations),\
  \ but always tries to kill or capture any creatures of mutated stock, as well as\
  \ all characters that have muta- tions which obviously separate them from pure stock.\
  \ The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and anything that attacks it (including\
  \ PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms. Due to its pro- gramming, the\
  \ Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes until whatever current mission\
  \ it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears as a massive, large-proportioned\
  \ humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively hidden by a holographic\
  \ projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental coloring as if it\
  \ had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings cover the outside\
  \ of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp duralloy shards\
  \ that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other units in the\
  \ Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its weaponry\
  \ simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed\
  \ in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and\
  \ their functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed\
  \ in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged\
  \ by an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided\
  \ for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be\
  \ charged to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable\
  \ is fired at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims\
  \ skin. The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to\
  \ wrap around a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of\
  \ 21 or greater to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage),\
  \ another replaces it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati-\
  \ cally. The weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter\
  \ are separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16\
  \ and a range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at\
  \ crea- tures. These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage\
  \ from bleeding per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area\
  \ is treated. The razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered\
  \ by two solar energy cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head\
  \ of the Robohunter has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached\
  \ to one side is a flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10\
  \ hp damage and has enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire\
  \ spreading to flammable materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet\
  \ also has an optical weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive\
  \ energy in any direction the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect\
  \ as the mutation radiation eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation\
  \ like the mutation. This attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy\
  \ cell source is drained and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from\
  \ the back of the Robohunter, allowing it to attack in all directions at once in\
  \ hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting\
  \ and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10 meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored\
  \ in the lower chest area of the Robohunter are three magnetic seal nets that are\
  \ the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter. The Robohunter also has a needler\
  \ pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful sleeping serum. This serum will\
  \ cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns unless he rolls under his\
  \ individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol is built into the robots\
  \ chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle. This rifle is capable\
  \ of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10 hp damage per burst.\
