description: These solitary creatures are rarely seen and only a few of them are known
  to exist in this region. Evolving over the years from the haphazard exposure to
  high energy radiation, Maali seem to be the distorted descendents of the North American
  moose.Their general appearance is still moose-like as they still possess short brown
  fur and large branching antlers. These bony and sturdy antlers usually grow over
  a meter in height and are used as deadly weapons by these mutants. Maali are four-legged
  creatures when travelling over great distances or when running, but through successive
  mutations they have evolved thick muscular hind legs. A startling development in
  these mutants was their change from hooven front feet to leathery human-like hands.
  The combination of strong rear legs and manipulative front hands has permitted these
  creatures to stand up, walk around, and use tools, weapons, and devices of the Ancients.Outstretched
  on its hind legs,a Maali stands over 3.5 meters tall. The most amazing aspect of
  these mutants though is their ability to speak. Rumor has it that they even understand
  the language of humans! Maali live in forest areas, but they are occasionally found
  in grassy locales when encountered migrating from one forest to another. They enjoy
  eating vegetation of all kinds and are known to have enormous appetites. All Maali
  hate meat.These beasts are almost always leaders of a large territory within the
  forest.It is very rare for another creature to challenge the Maali's authority within
  its domain,and in return the mutant moose becomes a fierce protector of its forest
  home.The facial expressions of these mutants have been scarred by the cruel effects
  of radiation,so much so that their crossed-eyes and drooping tongues have made them
  appear as idiot creatures.This impression is often the downfall of most enemies,
  since Maali are a dangerous and deadly foe if provoked.These mutated moose possess
  great mental powers and having a dual brain allows them to function quite effectively
  in the wild forests.Maali are fascinated by high technology and will always try
  to acquire artifacts and items created by the Ancients.They are very skilled in
  the handling of such items and they enjoy using these devices whenever the opportunity
  arises. However, the sight of robotic units sends these mutants into epileptic trances
  (Epilepsy defect).Maali will remain motionless for a period of about 10 minutes
  when robotic units are first seen,then afterwards they will react normally.
