Androids were considered primitive and antiquated by the super-science metrics of the Ancient Ones, as their primary utility had been largely superseded by the use of soft-light and hard-light holograms. Still, there were times and places where economics favored the use of the ever-sturdy android. Thus, many were still in use at the time of the Great Disaster.  They are especially prevalent in areas where holograms can not be deployed. All androids have a limited amount of memory storage space, so they can effectively be taught in only one field of endeavour. They have been made sensitive to certain sonics frequencies so that they are easily damaged by them. They are powered by energy from energy cells.  The usefulness of this of creation is obvious. They can be made to have great strength; can be made to be very small and thus fit in places an engineering robot cannot enter. They can be made radiation resistant so that they can operate in areas where even a man in a suit would be in danger for any length of time. The medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for 24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks. Lack of energy after 24 hours will cause the android to hibernate until energy is restored.",
