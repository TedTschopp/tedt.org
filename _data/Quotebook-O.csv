"If you can keep your head when all about you  
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
 
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;  
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
 
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,

who strives valiantly; who errs,
who comes short again and again,

who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,

at least fails while daring greatly,

"A major goal of The Lord of The Rings was to dramatise that 'theory of courage' which Tolkien had said was the 'great contribution' to humanity of the old literature of the North. The central figure of that theory was Ragnarok - the day when gods and men would fight evil and the giants, and inevitably be defeated. Its great statement was that defeat was no refutation. The right side remains right even if it has no ultimate hope at all.

"I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which “Escape” is now so often used: a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism give no warrant at all. In what the misusers are fond of calling Real Life, Escape is evidently as a rule very practical, and may even be heroic. In real life it is difficult to blame it, unless it fails; in criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds. Evidently we are faced by a misuse of words, and also by a confusion of thought. Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter.
 
Just so a Party-spokesman might have labelled departure from the misery of the Führer’s or any other Reich and even criticism of it as treachery. In the same way these critics, to make confusion worse, and so to bring into contempt their opponents, stick their label of scorn not only on to Desertion, but on to real Escape, and what are often its companions, Disgust, Anger, Condemnation, and Revolt. Not only do they confound the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the deserter; but they would seem to prefer the acquiescence of the “quisling” to the resistance of the patriot. To such thinking you have only to say “the land you loved is doomed” to excuse any treachery, indeed to glorify it.", ,On Fairy Tales,5,Escape,09-26-2016 10:03:04
"“A modern man,” said Dr. Cyrus Pym, “must, if he be thoughtful, approach the problem of marriage with some caution. Marriage is a stage — doubtless a suitable stage — in the long advance of mankind towards a goal which we cannot as yet conceive; which we are not, perhaps, as yet fitted even to desire. What, gentlemen, is the ethical position of marriage? Have we outlived it?”

“Outlived it?” broke out Moon; “why, nobody’s ever survived it! Look at all the people married since Adam and Eve — and all as dead as mutton.”

“This is no doubt an inter-pellation joc’lar in its character,” said Dr. Pym frigidly. “I cannot tell what may be Mr. Moon’s matured and ethical view of marriage –”

"We are constantly assured that the churches are empty because preachers insist too much upon doctrine — ‘dull dogma,’ as people call it. The fact is the precise opposite. It is the neglect of dogma that makes for dullness. The Christian faith is the most exciting drama that ever staggered the imagination of man — and the dogma is the drama.

This is the dogma we find so dull — this terrifying drama which God is the victim and the hero. If this is dull, then what, in Heaven’s name, is worthy to be called exciting? The people who hanged Christ never, to do them justice, accused Him of being a bore — on the contrary; they thought Him too dynamic to be safe. It has been left for later generations to muffle up that shattering personality and surround Him with an atmosphere of tedium.

It is seen as something that's damaging the organism. So they act, and sometimes even collude, to destroy it.  They are paid good money to do that. Their incentives are all very clear and they go to their boss every year and get a raise because they've been successful. You have to understand that no matter how muich someone, even the CEO, has a vision, if the organization underneath has not been properly incentivized to absorb the change, it's almost impossible to build that kind of structure.

"""It it is worse than useless for Christians to talk about the importance of Christian morality, unless they are prepared to take their stand upon the fundamentals of Christian theology. It is a lie to say that dogma does not matter; it matters enormously. It is fatal to let people suppose that Christianity is only a mode of feeling; it is vitally necessary to insist that it is first and foremost a rational explanation of the universe. It is hopeless to offer Christianity as a vaguely idealistic aspiration of a simple and consoling kind; it is, on the contrary, a hard, tough, exacting, and complex doctrine, steeped in a drastic and incompromising realism. And it is fatal to imagine that everybody knows quite well what Christianity is and needs only a little encouragement to practice it.

And cheerful wisdom played like drum

I know he is coming, coming, To help, to guide, to save. Though I hear no martial drumming And see no flags that wave. But the great soul-travail of woman, And the bold, free thought unfurled, And heralds that say he is on the way, The coming Man of the world.
Mourn not for the vanished ages With their grand, heroic men, Who dwell in history’s pages And live in the poet’s pen. For the grandest times are before us, And the world is yet to see The noblest work of this old earth In the Men that are to be.",Ella Wheeler Wilcox,The Coming Man of the World,0,,09-03-2014 14:34:03

"• Anything you buy, you must maintain. A purchase is just the beginning.
You can expect to devote as much money/time in maintaining a technology as
you did in acquiring and installing it.
• Acquire at the last possible moment. Technologies improve so fast you
should postpone getting anything until 5 minutes before you need it. Then
accept the fact that anything you buy is already obsolete.
• You will be newbie forever. Get good at the beginner mode: learning new
programs, asking dumb questions, making stupid mistakes, soliciting help.
• Often learning a new tool requires unlearning old ones. The habits of
using a land line phone don't work in email or cell phone. The habits of
email don't work in twitter. The habits of twitter won't work in what is
next. Try to leave the old habits behind when venturing to new forms.
• Take sabbaticals. Once a week let go of your tools. Once a year take a
break from the whole system gracefully. Once in your life step back
completely and turn everything off until your soul says to turn it back on.
You'll return with renewed enthusiasm and perspective.
• Keep it easy to switch. You will leave the tool you are using today at
some time in the near future. How easy will it be to leave? If leaving
forces you to leave all your data behind, or to learn a new way of typing,
or to surrender four other technologies you were still using, then maybe
this is not the best one to start.

• Quality is not always related to price. Sometimes expensive gear is
better, sometimes the least expensive is best for you. Most folks don’t
ever use the premium features they paid for. And 95% of most tools are
abandonded before they wear out. Quality is related to your personal use.
• For every expert opinion that you find online, seek out an equal but
opposite expert opinion somewhere else. Don’t rely on  raves only.  If you
have not heard any negatives, you have not yet found all the opinions.
• You don’t need to understand the mechanics of a new technology before you
start using it.  The best way to understand it is to use it.
• Tools are metaphors that shape how you think. What embedded assumptions
does the new tool make? Does it assume right-handedness, or literacy, or a
password, or a place to throw it away? Where the defaults are set can
reflect a tool's bias. You should ask yourself what does this technology
assume?
• What other thing do you give up? This one has taken me a long time to
learn. The only way to take up a new technology is to reduce an old one in
my life already. Social media, for instance, must come at the expense of
something else I was doing -- even if it just daydreaming.
• Every new technology will bite back. The more powerful its gifts, the
more powerfully it can be abused. Look for its costs.
• Risks are relative. The risks of a new technology can’t be evaluation
alone; they must be compared to the risks of the older technology, or no
technology. For instance the risks of a new dental MRI must be compared to
the risks of an old x-ray, or to the risks of no x-ray and getting
cavities. The costs of the new must be compared to costs of the old.
• Be suspicious of any technology that requires walls to prevent access. If
you can’t fix it, modify it or hack it yourself, that is a  sign.
* Teaching others what you learn (like posting solutions to things you
figured out) is the best way to keep learning about a technology yourself.
• The proper response to a stupid technology is not to outlaw it but to
make a better one yourself, just as the proper response to a stupid idea is
not to outlaw it but to replace it with a better idea.
• Nobody has any idea of what a new invention will really be good for,
including its inventors. You can’t evaluate new things by merely thinking
about them. To evaluate, try it, then think.
• The second order effects of technology usually only arrive when everyone
has one, or it is present everywhere. Drones are cool, but what if everyone
has one hovering over their shoulder?
• The older the technology, the more likely it will continue to be useful.
It may need to find a more limited new job, but don’t dismiss it. Some of
the best new things are old things re-imagined.
• Find the minimum amount of technology that will maximize your options.﻿",Kevin Kelly, ,0,,09-03-2014 14:30:06

"Information wants to be free. Information also wants to be expensive. Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine — too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away.

"If you take a flat map
And move wooden blocks upon it strategically,
The thing looks well, the blocks behave as they should.
The science of war is moving live men like blocks.
And getting the blocks into place at a fixed moment.
But it takes time to mold your men into blocks
And flat maps turn into country where creeks and gullies
Hamper your wooden squares. They stick in the brush,
They are tired and rest, they straggle after ripe blackberries,
And you cannot lift them up in your hand and move them.
--A string of blocks curling smoothly around the left
Of another string of blocks and crunching it up--
It is all so clear in the maps, so clear in the mind,
But the orders are slow, the men in the blocks are slow
To move, when they start they take too long on the way--
The General loses his stars and the block-men die
In unstrategic defiance of martial law
Because still used to just being men, not block-parts.", , ,5,"Blocks,Management,Strategy,War",09-03-2014 14:16:59
"Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.

"A child kicks his legs rhythmically through excess, not absence, of life. Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ‘Do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ‘Do it again’ to the sun; and every evening, ‘Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them.
