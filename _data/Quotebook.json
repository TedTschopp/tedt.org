The central figure of that theory was Ragnarok - the day when gods and men would fight evil and the giants, and inevitably be defeated. Its great statement was that defeat was no refutation. The right side remains right even if it has no ultimate hope at all. In a sense this Northern mythology asks more of men, even makes more of them, than does Christianity, for it offers them no heaven, no salvation, no reward for virtue other than the somber satisfaction of having done what is right.",

    "quote": "I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which “Escape” is now so often used: a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism give no warrant at all. In what the misusers are fond of calling Real Life, Escape is evidently as a rule very practical, and may even be heroic. In real life it is difficult to blame it, unless it fails; in criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds. Evidently we are faced by a misuse of words, and also by a confusion of thought. Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter.\n \nJust so a Party-spokesman might have labelled departure from the misery of the Führer’s or any other Reich and even criticism of it as treachery. In the same way these critics, to make confusion worse, and so to bring into contempt their opponents, stick their label of scorn not only on to Desertion, but on to real Escape, and what are often its companions, Disgust, Anger, Condemnation, and Revolt. Not only do they confound the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the deserter; but they would seem to prefer the acquiescence of the “quisling” to the resistance of the patriot. To such thinking you have only to say “the land you loved is doomed” to excuse any treachery, indeed to glorify it.",

What, gentlemen, is the ethical position of marriage? Have we outlived it?”\n\n“Outlived it?” broke out Moon; “why, nobody’s ever survived it! Look at all the people married since Adam and Eve — and all as dead as mutton.”\n\n“This is no doubt an inter-pellation joc’lar in its character,” said Dr. Pym frigidly. “I cannot tell what may be Mr. Moon’s matured and ethical view of marriage –”\n\n“I can tell,” said Michael savagely, out of the gloom. “Marriage is a duel to the death, which no man of honour should decline.”\n\n“Michael,” said Arthur Inglewood in a low voice, “you must keep quiet.”",

If this is dull, then what, in Heaven’s name, is worthy to be called exciting? The people who hanged Christ never, to do them justice, accused Him of being a bore — on the contrary; they thought Him too dynamic to be safe. It has been left for later generations to muffle up that shattering personality and surround Him with an atmosphere of tedium.

The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.

    "quote": "In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, \"Anyone can cook.\" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.",

    "quote": "• Anything you buy, you must maintain. A purchase is just the beginning.\nYou can expect to devote as much money/time in maintaining a technology as\nyou did in acquiring and installing it.\n• Acquire at the last possible moment. Technologies improve so fast you\nshould postpone getting anything until 5 minutes before you need it. Then\naccept the fact that anything you buy is already obsolete.\n• You will be newbie forever. Get good at the beginner mode: learning new\nprograms, asking dumb questions, making stupid mistakes, soliciting help.\n• Often learning a new tool requires unlearning old ones. The habits of\nusing a land line phone don't work in email or cell phone. The habits of\nemail don't work in twitter. The habits of twitter won't work in what is\nnext. Try to leave the old habits behind when venturing to new forms.\n• Take sabbaticals. Once a week let go of your tools. Once a year take a\nbreak from the whole system gracefully. Once in your life step back\ncompletely and turn everything off until your soul says to turn it back on.\nYou'll return with renewed enthusiasm and perspective.\n• Keep it easy to switch. You will leave the tool you are using today at\nsome time in the near future. How easy will it be to leave? If leaving\nforces you to leave all your data behind, or to learn a new way of typing,\nor to surrender four other technologies you were still using, then maybe\nthis is not the best one to start.\n\n• Quality is not always related to price. Sometimes expensive gear is\nbetter, sometimes the least expensive is best for you. Most folks don’t\never use the premium features they paid for. And 95% of most tools are\nabandonded before they wear out. Quality is related to your personal use.\n• For every expert opinion that you find online, seek out an equal but\nopposite expert opinion somewhere else. Don’t rely on  raves only.  If you\nhave not heard any negatives, you have not yet found all the opinions.\n• You don’t need to understand the mechanics of a new technology before you\nstart using it.  The best way to understand it is to use it.\n• Tools are metaphors that shape how you think. What embedded assumptions\ndoes the new tool make? Does it assume right-handedness, or literacy, or a\npassword, or a place to throw it away? Where the defaults are set can\nreflect a tool's bias. You should ask yourself what does this technology\nassume?\n• What other thing do you give up? This one has taken me a long time to\nlearn. The only way to take up a new technology is to reduce an old one in\nmy life already. Social media, for instance, must come at the expense of\nsomething else I was doing -- even if it just daydreaming.\n• Every new technology will bite back. The more powerful its gifts, the\nmore powerfully it can be abused. Look for its costs.\n• Risks are relative. The risks of a new technology can’t be evaluation\nalone; they must be compared to the risks of the older technology, or no\ntechnology. For instance the risks of a new dental MRI must be compared to\nthe risks of an old x-ray, or to the risks of no x-ray and getting\ncavities. The costs of the new must be compared to costs of the old.\n• Be suspicious of any technology that requires walls to prevent access. If\nyou can’t fix it, modify it or hack it yourself, that is a  sign.\n* Teaching others what you learn (like posting solutions to things you\nfigured out) is the best way to keep learning about a technology yourself.\n• The proper response to a stupid technology is not to outlaw it but to\nmake a better one yourself, just as the proper response to a stupid idea is\nnot to outlaw it but to replace it with a better idea.\n• Nobody has any idea of what a new invention will really be good for,\nincluding its inventors. You can’t evaluate new things by merely thinking\nabout them. To evaluate, try it, then think.\n• The second order effects of technology usually only arrive when everyone\nhas one, or it is present everywhere. Drones are cool, but what if everyone\nhas one hovering over their shoulder?\n• The older the technology, the more likely it will continue to be useful.\nIt may need to find a more limited new job, but don’t dismiss it. Some of\nthe best new things are old things re-imagined.\n• Find the minimum amount of technology that will maximize your options.﻿",

    "quote": "A child kicks his legs rhythmically through excess, not absence, of life. Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ‘Do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ‘Do it again’ to the sun; and every evening, ‘Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.",

That is what has to be believed. Any theories we build up as to how Christ's death did all this are, in my view, quite secondary: mere plans or diagrams to be left alone if they do not help us, and, if they do help us, not to be confused with the thing itself.",

The idea was that a human being must become real before it can expect to receive any message from the superhuman; that is, it must be speaking with its own voice (not one of its borrowed voices), expressing its actual desires (not what it imagines that it desires), being for good or ill itself, not any mask, veil, or persona.",
