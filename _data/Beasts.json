    "Name": "Lynx",
    "Other Names": "Bobcat, Desert Cat, Caracal",
    "Appearance": "This long-haired cat has tufts of black hair growing form the tips of its ears.",
    "Description": "The lynx is a member of the great cat family and makes its home in the colder regions of the world, most often in rocky areas above the tree line.  Lynxes are generally solitary creatures and are excellent climbers.  The lynx, like other big cats, is territorial and a solitary hunter. Most of its hunting is done during the daylight hours, though some species of lynx hunts only at night. Its diet generally consists of small animals such as rodents, birds, fish, and rabbits. During the winter months its diet includes larger prey such as elk or deer. Prey that is killed is partially eaten and the remaining carcass is buried in thick underbrush or snow. The lynx returns over a period of 1d6 days to finish its meal.  Lynxes are generally solitary creatures, but occasionally a den is discovered that contains a male, female and 1d6 cubs. Cubs are generally ineffective and non-threatening in combat. Cubs are sometimes captured and sold on the market where they can be trained and raised.  A lynx has thick, gray fur that is spotted, striped, or plain. During the winter months through the summer months, its coat varies from spotted to plain. Its short tail is ringed and tipped with black fur. Its pointed ears are tipped with tufts of long black hairs and its eyes range from green to gray to brown. Its paws are large and covered with thick fur. This helps the lynx distribute its weight when moving across snowy terrain. The average lynx is 2 1/2 feet to 4 feet long and weighs 20-40 pounds.  Lynxes stalk their prey and prefer to strike from ambush. They primarily use their bite attack in combat, only relying on their claws if they must.  A lynx goes for the \"kill shot\" at first opportunity against its quarry, attempting to sink its teeth into its opponent's throat.  Caracal The caracal is a small cat, very similar to the lynx, and is commonly referred to as the desert lynx (even though it doesn't live in desert regions). The caracal uses the statistics for the lynx, but is found in warm or temperate plains and hills and does not have the snow move ability of the standard lynx.  Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",

Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds.  While the tiger itself is a fearsome predator, its strength and ferocity pales in comparison to that of the larger Giant tiger.  Known to many scholars as the smilodon and to tribal societies as the saber-toothed tiger, the Giant tiger is invariably one of the region's top predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors that hang down like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding menacingly even when the creature's mouth is shut.

These lords of the avian world have been observed in complex social rituals and have life-long pair bonding. They have been observed to store food in multiple locations for lean times and are rather adept at thievery. They are omnivores that prefer smaller birds, eggs, and insects; seeds and fruit are acceptable as well. They are territorial and do not migrate in winter; as the weather turns cold they gather into larger flocks to increase their foraging potential.",

Hammerhead Shark (CR 3): This shark has a distinctive hammer-shaped head. It is an advanced shark. Tiger Shark (CR 3): Larger than the average shark, the ravenous tiger shark is a giant shark.

    "Description": "Polar bears swim along frigid coasts and wander icy plains looking for prey. They often eat seals plucked from holes in the ice, but will attack any creature when desperate or provoked. Unlike most animals, polar bears show little fear, and can be dangerous scavengers around arctic settlements. They can easily avoid conf lict by plunging into the icy waters, which they often do instead of engaging every threat. A polar bear's blubber gives it buoyancy, and its long neck keeps its head above water. Oversized paws with webbed toes propel it along steadily, and a polar bear can swim over 100 miles in a single day.  Some arctic clans hunt polar bears as a significant source of food, and use the furs and bones for clothes and vital tools. Many of these cultures hold the bears sacred, and honor their deaths with rituals and ceremonies. Polar bears live, on average, 15-20 years, but arctic peoples have known individual bears that lived as long as 40 years. One of the largest animal predators to stalk the ice, an adult male polar bear can weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, with females weighing 350 to 650 pounds.",

Other variants exist as well, such as the particularly ugly warthogs that dwell in tropical plains and savannahs. Boars are often hunted for their flesh, which is considered delicious by most humanoids. Those who hunt boars often do so with a special spear fitted with a cross beam to prevent an impaled boar from pushing forward along the spear shaft to gore its tormentor.  The boar's stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves' guilds keep boars for the disposal of bodies, while orc tribes let them run loose in their lairs, where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of refuse.

The badger possesses a fierceness and natural tenacity, while its stubby legs and wide, seemingly portly stature belie the creature's actual strength and speed.  A typical badger has dark brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings, such as bands or striped masks about the eyes.  These markings are distinct and vary by species. While generally friendly, if threatened or otherwise provoked, badgers can become fierce combatants.  Once engaged with an opponent, they typically fight until slain. In combat, they fight with their sharp, needle-like teeth and long, curved claws, which they otherwise use for digging.",

These creatures, like all birds of prey, have powerful clawed talons and sharp, hooked beaks perfect for tearing flesh. Their enhanced eyesight allows them to spot prey from great distances, and they typically hunt in wide circling patterns high above the ground.  Eagles typically build their massive nests in the tops of tall trees or among the rocky crags of steep cliffs. During breeding season, an eagle lays two eggs, but only one chick normally survives, as the stronger of the two usually kills and eats the weaker.  Eagles generally weigh between 8 and 15 pounds, with a wingspan of up to 7 feet, depending on the species.",

When faced with a foe or small group of threats, the grizzly attempts to subdue or kill with its claws.  When it can, the bear tries to grab a single target to deal continual damage until that target is dead, unconscious, or escapes.  To generate stats for a smaller bear (like a black bear), you can apply the young simple template to the grizzly bear's stat block.

While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the water in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger.  Quetzalcoatlus Perhaps the largest of the pterosaurs, the quetzalcoatlus (known to some as the \"swamp stalker\" and others by the misnomer of \"dragonling\") is truly an awe-inspiring sight in the air, with its impressive 40-foot wingspan. On the ground, this creature's profile bears an uncanny resemblance to that of a giraffe, save for the fact that the folded wings arch up to either side of its lightly feathered body, and its head bears a horrific, razor-sharp beak.

Attracted to the edges of human settlements in their territory, jackals often make opportunistic raids on fruit crops and vulnerable domesticated animals. They're also attracted to large deposits of garbage that they can sift through for leftover food. Jackals are remarkably adaptable, and readily forage for insects or fruit, feed on found carcasses, or hunt small or vulnerable game as the opportunity presents itself.  Jackals are notorious for their craftiness in evading pursuit, and they've been known to feign death when caught in order to lull opponents into complacency and gain another chance to escape. A jackal can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its opponent's Sense Motive check to play dead. If successful, after combat ends, the jackal can begin a new encounter with surprise. During the surprise round, only the jackal and any opponents who succeeded on their Sense Motive checks can act.",

    "Name": "Mammoth",
    "Other Names": "",
    "Appearance": "This massive elephant-like creature is covered in long, coarse hair, and its tusks sweep upward in great curves of yellowed ivory.",
    "Description": "The woolly mammoth is a relative of both the common elephant and the mastodon (see Mastodon elsewhere in this book). Like the mastodon, it is an herbivore and spends its days eating nuts, fruits, berries, and grasses. The typical mammoth consumes nearly 450 pounds of food and 50 gallons of water in a given day. Mammoths travel in herds with the young moving in the center, protected and surrounded by the adults. If danger is present or a threat is imminent, the males move to face the danger, while the females encircle the young. The woolly mammoth generally reproduces in the spring months with young being born about 22 months later. A young woolly mammoth resembles a miniature version of an adult, complete with fur, and under fur. It does not yet have the mighty tusks of the mammoth, though the tusks grow in quickly as the young mammoth reaches maturity (around age 12). The mammoth has the same predators as the mastodon; the Giant wolf, the smilodon, and man. Man hunts these creatures for the same reason they hunt the mastodon: meat, fur, ivory, or to capture young mammoths to be trained as mounts and beasts of burden. The mammoth is a relative of the elephant and the mastodon though its head is slightly taller than an elephant's and slightly wider than a mastodon's. Its upward curving tusks are longer than those of the mastodon, and its trunk ends in two, small finger-like projections used for grasping branches, fruits, and other such small items. The mammoth stands about 22 feet tall and is covered in a thick coat of gray, brown, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or black fur with a coarse \"under-fur\" beneath it to protect it in harsh climates. Mammoths generally avoid combat unless provoked or the herd is threatened. They have no natural fear of any creature, so do not flee. If the herd is threatened, mammoths fight by goring with their tusks or trampling. Mammoths fight to the death to protect their young. Training a Mammoth A mammoth must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a mammoth must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly mammoth requires six weeks of work and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25). Riding a mammoth requires an exotic saddle. A mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check. Mammoth young are worth 13,000 gp each on the open market. Professional trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train a mammoth. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a mammoth is up to 4,152 pounds; a medium load, 4,153 to 8,304 pounds; and a heavy load, 8,305 to 12,480 pounds. A mammoth can drag 62,400 pounds. ",

Males have broad, flat antlers that can reach a length of 5 feet or more. These antlers are shed each year after mating season. The moose's fur ranges from brown to black, changing to a dull gray in the winter months. They are excellent swimmers, often swimming into deep water to feed on aquatic plants.  Generally non-aggressive if left alone, moose can become quite aggressive if approached. They have poor eyesight, but excellent hearing, and tend to flee rather than fight as soon as would-be attackers are detected. If forced into combat, a moose attacks with its antlers or hooves. ",

Deer are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim to a distance of five miles in the water. These statistics represent the typical white-tailed deer; they can also be used to represent other deer-like animals such as caribou and antelope. Deer attack with their hooves or antlers. Antelopes, when defending their herd, attack by charging an opponent and butting with their horns (gore). The gore attack only applies to bucks with antlers. Black-Tailed Deer The statistics above can be used to represent the average black-tailed deer as well, with a few minor changes. The black-tailed deer prefers plains, hills, and other open ground as its habitat. It has a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. In combat, a black-tailed deer jumps about in an effort to confuse its attackers before stotting (hopping) away. ",
