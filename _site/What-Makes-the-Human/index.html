    <ol>
      <li>As a Child you were known to be stronger, smarter, more socially aware, or more spiritually aware.  Assign 3 points Aspect you were strongest in.</li>
      <li>Tell me the story about what happened to make you stand out among your peers, was it the overall strength, speed, or balance between those two that made you stand out.  Assign 2 points to the Characteristics that represent that.</li>
      <li>As a child you were know to be the least gifted in Fitness, Academics, Mystical arts, or Emotion.  Assign -2 points to the aspect you were weakest in.</li>
      <li>Tell me the story about what happened to make you stand out among your peers, was it the lack of strength, speed, or balance between strength and speed that made you stand out.  Assign -1 point to the characteristics that represented that.</li>

<h2 id="knowledge-areas">Knowledge Areas</h2>

<p>You acquire knowledge through experience or education. You can acquire knowledge without applying it. This is what happens when you rely on your Aspects and Characteristics to get accomplish a task. Overtime you will acquire enough knowledge to finally develop enough proficiency to gain a skill in that area. When this is done in a controlled environment like an educational institution or from an instructor or a tutor, you gain the knowledge on how these skills apply to your other Aspects and Characteristics. If, however you have no formal teacher or you are out discovering something new at the bleeding edge of technical development for your culture, you only get to apply the Aspects and Characteristics associated with your skill to the task at hand.</p>

<p>You demonstrate competency, and thus succeeding in your knowledge area rolls, by applying the necessary knowledge and skill in a real-world setting where you take full responsibility and accountability for your actions. The experience gained in this manner distinguishes demonstrated skill from demonstrated competency.</p>

You are a master or you have a master’s degree at level 3. You are a grand master or you have a doctorate degree at level 4.

<p>Community Hallmarks are qualities that describe different aspects of a character’s build, temperament, and abilities, which can provide advantages in certain situations. The key principle governing Community Hallmarks is that their descriptions must make it reasonably believable that individuals possessing those qualities would perform better under the given circumstances compared to those who lack them. Virtues are not ranked and cannot be enhanced or improved.</p>

<p>A Character may end up with more than one Community Hallmark, the one rule governing this is that a character cannot have opposing Hallmarks. Use the table below to identify opposing Community Hallmarks. In many cases there are multiple virtues that are similar to each other if players want to play a character who is conflicted.</p>

<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>

<p>You don’t find yourself under a familiar roof for much of the year. You may opt for an outdoor lifestyle, or circumstances may compel you to take refuge in unconventional locations or seek shelter in remote areas. Your first test of skill is choosing the right amount of equipment to carry, aiming for a manageable load—an indication of your expertise in the field. The same principle applies to your tactical gear. You must resist the temptation to opt for the most powerful weapons and most protective armor, as such heavy and unwieldy burdens are likely to significantly impede your operational capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="pocket-money">Pocket Money</h3>

<p>You do not have to keep track of accommodation, food, or incidental travel expenses as long as your Hero’s spending stays within the limits of their pocket money. These limits are determined by the Referee.</p>

<p>Money will likely only become a concern during play when large amounts are being spent. This could include preparing for a major trip, purchasing expensive items like a vehicle or rare book, or hiring extra staff.</p>

<p>If you spend an amount beyond your ‘spending limit,’ you must reduce your cash by the full amount spent. If you don’t have enough cash, you can consider using your assets. Converting assets into cash takes time, and the duration is determined by the Referee. Processes like mortgaging a property, selling antiques, converting assets into pocket money, or obtaining loans all require time. If you are away from your hometown, these processes are likely to take even longer.</p>

<p>If you make multiple purchases below your spending threshold on the same day, the Referee may require you to combine the total purchases to compare them with your spending level. If you exceed the spending limit, you’ll need to deduct the excess cash spent. The above tables will give you and the Referee guidelines on how to handle this.</p>

<p>During the game, your character may receive a substantial sum of money as a reward. Treat such windfalls as Assets.</p>

<p>Taking on and repaying debts is all part of your story. It could involve selling your Hero’s car or seeking money from a loan shark. While financial transactions are not the main focus of play, the gradual decline of your character’s finances may go hand-in-hand with the deterioration of your Mental, Social, or Spiritual Aspects.</p>

<h3 id="personal-possessions">Personal Possessions</h3>

<p>You embark on your journey fully prepared for long periods of travel and sleeping in the open. It is expected that every character carries the necessary equipment for an adventurous life. This equipment consists of two main categories: Equipment and Operational Gear.</p>

<h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>

<p>You can apply the same approach when you’re wondering if your character should already possess a specific item as part of their standard belongings. If you find yourself in this situation, ask yourself (or consult the Referee) about the relevance of the object to your character’s profession. In such cases, your character’s occupation should offer the most insights, particularly when considering their appropriate Pocket Money.</p>

<p>Should you, as a Thief, carry a set of lock-picks with you? Absolutely, and make sure it’s a top-notch set.</p>

<p>Should you, as a Chef, own a set of high-quality knives? Definitely, and they should be well-maintained and sharp.</p>

<p>Should you, as a Photographer, have a reliable camera? Of course, and it should be capable of capturing high-resolution images.</p>

<p>Should you, as a Software Developer, possess a powerful laptop? Yes, and it should have enough processing power and memory to handle your tasks efficiently.</p>

<p>Should you, as a Mechanic, have a comprehensive set of tools? Absolutely, and they should be organized for easy access and use.</p>

<h4 id="operational-gear">Operational Gear</h4>

<p>At the start of the game, you can equip your character with any weapon your hero is capable of wielding, as well as any shield and armor you choose to carry or wear. If your hero loses or breaks any of these items, they will be automatically replaced the next time you reach a friendly settlement or at another suitable moment in the story. If the settlement isn’t from your hero’s own community, you might be asked to perform a small favor in return, such as completing a task or sharing a song or tale.</p>

<h4 id="curated-gear">Curated Gear</h4>

<p>At the start of the game, you select your operative’s initial equipment. This includes standard-issue weapons, a set of tactical armor, and perhaps additional protective gear like a helmet or shield and a cell phone.</p>

<p>Curated Gear is another matter. Curated Gear can be Specialized tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items. Such items could be gifts / loans from your organization, family, or perhaps a high-ranking official allows you to choose a piece of equipment from their private arsenal. Alternatively, you might have personally modified, repaired, or adapted this gear to meet your specific needs. The types of modifications and customizations depend on both the item itself and the technology or culture that produced it, as well as your own operative’s background.</p>

<p>Whenever your operative advances in rank, you earn a Bonus. This Bonus allows you to enhance one piece of equipment with a new specialized feature. Each time your operative acquires an item of exceptional quality, you should craft a narrative to commemorate this milestone for your character.</p>

<p>If your character happens to lose any of their Curated Gear, they will be able to acquire standard Operational Gear to replace it. However, all the customizations, advanced features, and other unique aspects of that gear will be lost until you retrieve them. You may choose to abandon this equipment, but doing so will affect your reputation and may lead to other unintended consequences, depending on who ends up with the gear.  In either event, such losses will effect the overall narrative structure of your story.</p>

<h5 id="specialized-tools">Specialized Tools</h5>

<p>You’ll come across objects that stand out for their exceptional and mesmerizing qualities. Whether it’s gemstones, secure data drives, advanced biotech implants, holographic storage modules, energy-efficient components, neural interfaces, nanotech-enhanced accessories, or quantum processors, you’ll recognize these as Specialized Tool. Their unique charm stems from the expertise of talented engineers, state-of-the-art technology, or the incorporation of specialized algorithms or energy systems.</p>

<p>Specialized Tools are your everyday equipment that has been tailored, specialized, or masterfully crafted to stretch the limits of what’s achievable or to showcase the engineer’s skills. These items are typically not weapons or armor; they are tools designed for a specific function. Generally, there’s no backstory or narrative tied to these objects, but they are readily available to agents who have proven their worth.</p>

<h5 id="elite-gear">Elite Gear</h5>

<p>You encounter items that possess extraordinary capabilities, which most people would consider highly advanced or even miraculous. These may include state-of-the-art stealth suits that make the wearer undetectable to security systems, sonic devices that can manipulate emotions in both allies and enemies, and augmented reality implants that enable the user to effortlessly locate and retrieve misplaced objects. These remarkable items come with advanced technological enhancements that amplify the innate skills of their users. The more advanced your expertise and status, the better you’ll understand these assets and the benefits they offer.</p>

<p>While these items are generally not classified as weapons, they are valuable assets often carried by the elite operatives or experts in this world. Each of these technological marvels has a rich backstory, offering clues to their origins and unique capabilities, adding layers of depth and intrigue to their existence.</p>

<h5 id="named-items">Named Items</h5>

<p>You will occasionally encounter Precious and Named Objects that bear specific designations. These are often identified by the name of their inventor or their most renowned owner. However, Named Items always possess distinct names and may even have multiple names, as they are known and referred to differently among various organizations or cultures. Once you utilize one long enough, these items may acquire additional names based on your actions or what you choose to call them.</p>

<p>Named Items, each possessing unique capabilities, may have visual or auditory cues that make them stand out, such as a distinct light or sound. However, in some cases, these special qualities are more discreet, barely noticeable to the untrained eye. It’s important to note that every Iconic Item has a rich backstory that merits thorough investigation.</p>

<p>These items are not just defined by their own characteristics but also by their inventors, the cultures or organizations from which they originate, the significant events they have been part of, and the diverse groups of people who have utilized them throughout history. All these factors contribute to the advantages and drawbacks that these items carry. While you may not be aware of all the intricate details surrounding an Famous Artifacts, as an operative, you may wish to uncover these hidden truths through various means, such as research, consultation with experts, or undertaking special missions.</p>

<p>You will find that sponsors, leaders, and subject matter experts from different organizations possess extensive knowledge about these items. Seeking their guidance will prove invaluable in unraveling the hidden histories of these assets. By consulting with these knowledgeable individuals, you can delve deeper into the origins, significance, and remarkable stories associated with these items.</p>

<p>Moreover, it’s worth noting that any equipment you acquire classified as Exceptional Quality or above holds potential for further interactions. You can exchange such exceptional items with the aforementioned leaders to unlock additional features and capabilities that lie within the exceptional items found in Caches. This exchange opens up new possibilities and enhances the potential of these powerful assets, allowing you to tap into their full capabilities and utilize them to your advantage.</p>

<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>

<p>You and your team will inevitably encounter various assets as you navigate through unfamiliar territories. It could be the long-forgotten hoard of a deceased Dragon, or the hidden cache left behind by a rogue spy agency, a valuable stash of data and technology guarded by a rogue AI, or the accumulated resources amassed by generations of space pirates. These Assets offer you and your colleagues a compelling objective for your missions, an opportunity to increase your personal resources, and a means to uncover hidden stories from the regions you explore.</p>

<h4 id="how-assets-works">How Assets Works</h4>

<p>You accumulate wealth as you acquire materials and items of significant value, such as currency, valuable data, and specialized technology. These possessions signify wealth far beyond the ordinary, and you have the option to invest your Assets when you’re not actively engaged in missions or operations. The value of each Asset is determined by a rating system, starting at a minimum of 1, which roughly corresponds to the resources necessary to sustain an operative for a month at a Prosperous Standard of Living, and potentially scaling upwards from there.</p>

<p>You record your personal Assets rating on the back of your character sheet and keep it updated as you discover and utilize it. When you and your fellow Company members come across a treasure, you must distribute it among yourselves, dividing its rating as you deem appropriate and noting your individual shares on your character sheets. If you have people accompanying you on your adventures that require payment, you must also share this treasure with them according to the rules outlined for them.</p>

<p>You have the opportunity to utilize the wealth indicated by your Asset rating when you decide to dedicate a Season to staying at home. During this period, you can engage in various types of investments, each requiring a specific amount of Asset points. These investments will shape the activities you pursue throughout the season.</p>

<h4 id="carrying-and-transporting-assets">Carrying and Transporting Assets</h4>

<p>You, as a player, have the option to take on the responsibility of managing the assets you acquire, whether it’s transporting secure data drives or carrying specialized equipment. Each unit of asset you carry adds to your Encumbrance, resulting in a one-point increase to your Fatigue rating for every unit of asset you choose to manage. It’s important to consider the implications of carrying too much in the way of assets, as it affects your character’s overall stamina.</p>

<h4 id="hiding-assets">Hiding Assets</h4>

<p>The currency, data files, technology, or other property that a few units of Asset represent might be more than you’re willing to manage during your missions. You may choose to secure your assets in a nearby safe location, planning to return later to retrieve them.</p>

<h4 id="cache">Cache</h4>

<p>Assets may not degrade like other mundane materials, certain resources possess a corruptive influence that surpasses tangible goods. The allure of valuable assets can ignite a fierce desire within those who seek them. You understand the distinction between a payment for your services from a corporation and a hidden stash of confidential data stored in a secure server. Both hold value, but the latter is a Cache, possessing an additional allure and a darker influence. The valuables you uncover within a rogue agency’s hidden base or stored within a long-forgotten data vault may carry a taint, their value capable of driving individuals to distraction and filling their hearts with insatiable ambition.</p>

<p>You must pass a Mystic test upon discovering tainted Cache, or you’ll suffer Spiritual Damage.</p>

<p>In addition to just currency and valuable data, a Cache can also contain other items such as advanced technology, high-value art pieces, and other renowned or long-forgotten intellectual property.</p>

<h2 id="property">Property</h2>

<p>Throughout the campaign, you may acquire a Property. In a fantasy setting, this could be a business like a smithy or a tavern. Alternatively, you might own a farm where peasants till the land and share a portion of each harvest with you. In a modern context, your Property could be a tech startup or a small consultancy firm. Property aren’t limited to physical assets; your family and home could also constitute a Property.</p>

<p>Your Property serves as your main occupation when you’re not out adventuring or, in a modern scenario, when you’re not engaged in other high-stakes activities. Not everyone has a Property.</p>

<h3 id="rating">Rating</h3>

<p>There are multiple avenues for you to acquire a Property. You might inherit one from a wealthy family member if you’re lucky. More commonly, you gain a Property as the outcome of an adventure, either as a gift or by discovering an unclaimed Property and taking it for yourself.</p>

<p>The worth of your Property is quantified in game terms by a numerical rating that ranges from 1 to 8. This rating is similar to the Target Number for an action, where a lower number is generally more desirable than a higher one. For instance, a struggling farm on a rocky hillside might have a rating of 1, while a prosperous farm in an easily accessible, fertile valley could have a rating of 6.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-score">Minimum Score</h3>

<p>You can’t own a Property unless you have a minimum score in a relevant characteristic. If the Property is within the borders of your homeland, its rating is limited by your Social score. If the Property is located outside your homeland, then its rating is capped by your Reputation score.</p>

<h3 id="running-a-property">Running A Property</h3>

<p>The day-to-day tasks of managing a business—like planting crops, mining ore, or forging tools—can be set aside in the game. It’s assumed that you either have the necessary skills or can hire someone who does. What really matters is how your Property might evolve over time and what benefits it yields.</p>

<h3 id="property-upkeep">Property Upkeep</h3>

<p>You will need to make a roll for your Property during the last Season of each year if your hero possesses one.</p>

<p>If your roll result is equal to or lower than the Property’s rating, your Property will generate enough wealth to maintain your character’s Pocket Money level.</p>

<p>However, the Referee has the discretion to interpret a result of 1 or 2, based on the current circumstances, as the Property failing to produce sufficient wealth to cover your living expenses. In such cases, you may need to spend stored Assets to sustain your Pocket Money.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your roll result exceeds the Property’s rating, not only will your character enjoy their appropriate Pocket Money, but if the Property is capable of generating wealth (e.g., an inn or tracts of land), it will earn Assets equal to the difference between the roll and the rating.</p>

<p>For example, if you roll a 9 on a Property rated 6, you earn three Assets that year.</p>

<p>If the result is Good, then good fortune strikes you! You gain no extra Assets but prosper in some other way—perhaps a sick child recovers, an old feud is settled, or the weather is unusually pleasant. The rating for the Property is permanently lowered by 1 (to a minimum of 3).</p>

<p>If the result is bad, then the Property suffers some disaster or misfortune. If you don’t take action in the next Season, the Property may be destroyed or have its rating increased.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-ranged-combat">Description of Ranged Combat</h5>

<p>Ranged Combat refers to the skill of using ranged weaponry, such as bows, crossbows, and firearms, to accurately hit targets from a distance. This skill encompasses a variety of techniques, including aiming, shooting mechanics, and target assessment, as well as specialized knowledge of the different types of ranged weapons available.</p>

<h5 id="examples-from-fiction">Examples from Fiction</h5>

<p>In J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings,” the character Legolas is a master of ranged combat, particularly with his elven longbow. A prince of the Woodland Realm, Legolas possesses keen eyesight and unmatched strength, allowing him to hit targets from great distances with incredible accuracy. Throughout the series, his skill with the bow proves invaluable to the Fellowship of the Ring, whether he’s picking off orcs from a distance or shooting down a fearsome Nazgûl on its flying steed.</p>

<p>For example, during the Battle of Helm’s Deep, Legolas uses his ranged combat skills to devastating effect. Stationed on the walls, he takes down numerous Uruk-hai attackers, providing crucial support to his allies on the ground. His ability to assess targets quickly and choose the most threatening ones to eliminate first showcases the strategic aspect of ranged combat.</p>

<p>A character specialized in ranged combat could offer similar advantages to their party. They might be able to take out a dangerous spellcaster lurking in the back of an enemy formation or shoot a rope to create a makeshift bridge, allowing the party to cross a chasm. Specializations could include long-distance sniping, rapid-fire techniques, or expertise in a particular type of ranged weapon like crossbows or firearms.</p>

<p>Legolas’s mastery of ranged combat not only makes him a formidable warrior but also adds depth to his character. His skill reflects his elven heritage and training, and it provides him with a unique role within the diverse group of heroes that make up the Fellowship. This skill is not just a combat asset; it’s an integral part of who Legolas is, shaping both his identity and his contributions to the quest to destroy the One Ring.</p>

<p>Your Athletics check covers difficult situations you want to do something that requires physical exertion related to your characters active strength.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-athletics-from-fiction">Examples of Athletics from Fiction</h5>

<p>In George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series, Brienne of Tarth is a character who excels in Athletics, particularly in the realms of strength and physical presence. Born into a noble family but with a natural inclination toward martial pursuits, Brienne trains rigorously to become a formidable warrior. Her athletic prowess is evident in her ability to best seasoned knights in combat, as well as in her capacity to endure long, grueling journeys on foot or horseback.</p>

<p>For instance, in “A Clash of Kings,” Brienne competes in a melee tournament and defeats several knights, ultimately winning the competition. Her athletic skill is not limited to raw strength; she also demonstrates agility and stamina, dodging blows and outlasting her opponents. Later, in “A Feast for Crows,” she undertakes a quest to find Sansa Stark, which involves traversing through difficult terrains and fighting off multiple attackers. Her athletic abilities enable her to survive these challenges and continue her quest.</p>

<p>A character with high Athletics could perform a variety of tasks that require physical prowess. They might be called upon to scale a cliff face to reach an enemy’s stronghold, or to swim across a fast-moving river to escape pursuit. Specializations within Athletics could include grappling, allowing the character to excel in hand-to-hand combat, or grit, enabling them to travel long distances without suffering fatigue.</p>

<p>Brienne’s athletic abilities add significant depth to her character. They make her a formidable warrior, yes, but they also serve as a symbol of her defiance against societal norms that seek to limit what she can achieve as a woman. Her skills in Athletics are not just practical assets; they are integral to her identity and her ongoing struggle to find respect and purpose in a world that often dismisses her.</p>

<p>Melee combat measures your character’s ability to attack and survive in armed melee combat. This skill also allows you to maintain the general quality of a melee weapon and to perform general maintenance to ensure their continued use. It will however, not allow you to build, repair, or jury rig a solution. Melee weapons can be improvised. This skill allows you to use acquire an improvised weapon.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-melee-combat-from-fiction">Examples of Melee Combat from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Bernard Cornwell’s “The Last Kingdom” series, Uhtred of Bebbanburg is a master of melee combat. Born a Saxon but raised by Vikings, Uhtred possesses a unique blend of combat techniques that make him a formidable warrior in close-quarters battle. He is skilled with a variety of weapons, from swords and axes to shields, and his combat style is a mix of Saxon discipline and Viking ferocity. Uhtred’s skill in melee combat is not just about swinging a weapon; he also understands the nuances of timing, positioning, and even the psychology of his opponents.</p>

<p>For example, in “Sword Song,” Uhtred finds himself in a dire situation, surrounded by enemies in a narrow alley. Using his melee combat skills, he quickly assesses the situation and chooses an improvised weapon—a piece of broken wood. With it, he manages to fend off multiple attackers, using the confined space to his advantage and turning the tide of the battle. His ability to maintain his weapons also comes into play; before another significant battle, he takes the time to sharpen his sword and check his shield, ensuring they are in optimal condition.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in melee combat could be invaluable in a variety of scenarios. They might be the one to hold the line during a desperate last stand, or use an improvised weapon to great effect when disarmed. Specializations could include expertise in dual-wielding, defensive techniques like parrying and blocking, or mastery of a particular type of melee weapon like maces or daggers.</p>

<p>Uhtred’s prowess in melee combat adds a rich layer to his character. It reflects his complex identity, caught between two cultures, and serves as a tool for survival in the brutal, war-torn world he inhabits. His skill is not just a means to vanquish foes; it’s a manifestation of his will to reclaim his home and shape his destiny, making him a compelling and multi-dimensional character.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-stealth">Description of Stealth</h5>

<p>Stealth is the art and practice of moving quietly, remaining unseen, and evading detection. It is often used for a range of activities, from reconnaissance to theft to survival. It incorporates elements of body control, understanding of one’s environment, and concealment techniques.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-stealth-from-fiction">Examples of Stealth from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Alexandre Dumas’ “The Count of Monte Cristo,” Edmond Dantès, who later becomes the Count, is a master of stealth and subterfuge. After being unjustly imprisoned and subsequently escaping from the Château d’If, Dantès meticulously plans his revenge against those who wronged him. His ability to move undetected, gather information, and manipulate situations from the shadows becomes a cornerstone of his elaborate schemes.</p>

<p>For example, in one memorable scene, Dantès infiltrates a party hosted by one of his enemies, Danglars. Using a disguise and his skills in stealth, he moves through the mansion unnoticed, gathering information and planting seeds of doubt among Danglars’ associates. His understanding of the environment, including where he could hide and how to move quietly through the rooms, allows him to execute his plan without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in stealth could serve multiple roles within a party. They might be the scout who goes ahead to assess the layout of an enemy camp, or the rogue who sneaks into a guarded vault to retrieve a valuable artifact. Specializations within the skill of stealth could include camouflage techniques, expertise in lock-picking, or specialized training in moving silently to avoid magical detection.</p>

<p>Edmond Dantès’ skill in stealth adds a complex layer to his character. It’s not just a practical skill set; it’s a manifestation of his transformation from a naive, wronged man into a cunning avenger. His mastery of stealth reflects his deep understanding of human nature and his environment, as well as his willingness to operate in moral grey areas to achieve his ends. This skill is integral to his identity and is crucial in driving the intricate plots and twists that make “The Count of Monte Cristo” a compelling tale of revenge and redemption.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-acrobatics">Description of Acrobatics</h5>

<p>Acrobatics is the skill of performing complex bodily movements that require agility and coordination. This skill encompasses everything from basic somersaults to intricate flips and twists.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-acrobatics-from-fiction">Examples of Acrobatics from Fiction</h5>

<p>Certainly, let’s explore acrobatics again, this time through a different lens.</p>

<p>In the “Assassin’s Creed” video game series, the main characters, known as Assassins, are highly skilled in acrobatics. Their ability to parkour through crowded cities, climb tall structures, and perform death-defying leaps is a hallmark of the franchise. This skill is not just for show; it’s a crucial part of their toolkit for assassination, evasion, and exploration.</p>

<p>For instance, in “Assassin’s Creed II,” the protagonist Ezio Auditore uses his acrobatic skills to navigate the rooftops of Renaissance Florence and Venice. These abilities are essential for evading capture, stalking targets, and reaching otherwise inaccessible areas. One memorable sequence involves Ezio using a series of flips and wall-runs to navigate a complex set of traps in an underground tomb, ultimately leading him to a hidden treasure.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in acrobatics could find numerous applications for their skills. They might use their agility to navigate a maze of laser traps, or employ a series of flips to cross a chasm that others cannot. In combat, their acrobatic prowess could allow them to dodge incoming attacks or to quickly scale a wall for a better vantage point.</p>

<p>The acrobatic skills of the Assassins in “Assassin’s Creed” not only make for engaging gameplay but also serve practical purposes within the narrative. Whether it’s for assassination, evasion, or exploration, their acrobatic abilities are integral to their identities and their missions.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-sleight-of-hand">Description of Sleight of Hand</h5>

<p>Sleight of Hand is the art of manual dexterity, trickery, and swift, agile hand movements. It includes a range of activities from pickpocketing and lock picking to magic tricks and deception.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-sleight-of-hand-from-fiction">Examples of Sleight of Hand from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Charles Dickens’ “Oliver Twist,” the Artful Dodger is a young but highly skilled practitioner of sleight of hand. As a pickpocket and a member of Fagin’s gang of child thieves, the Dodger is adept at lifting wallets, handkerchiefs, and other valuables from unsuspecting victims. His quick fingers and keen eye for opportunity make him one of the most successful thieves in the gang, and he serves as a mentor of sorts to Oliver when he joins them.</p>

<p>For example, when Oliver is first introduced to the world of pickpocketing, it’s the Artful Dodger who demonstrates how it’s done. With a swift, almost invisible movement, he lifts a handkerchief from a gentleman’s pocket, all while engaging the man in conversation to distract him. The Dodger’s skill in sleight of hand is so refined that his victims often don’t realize they’ve been robbed until long after he’s disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in sleight of hand could be invaluable for various covert operations. They could pickpocket a guard to obtain a key, or subtly plant a false piece of evidence on a person to mislead investigators. Specializations might include advanced techniques for lifting items from secured or trapped pouches, or skills in palming and hiding small objects, like poison vials or magical trinkets, without detection.</p>

<p>The Artful Dodger’s mastery of sleight of hand adds depth and complexity to his character. While he is undoubtedly a product of his harsh environment, his skills also speak to a natural cleverness and adaptability. These traits make him not just an effective thief but also a compelling figure who embodies the resourcefulness needed to survive in the unforgiving world of Dickensian London.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-driveridepilot">Description of Drive/Ride/Pilot</h5>

<p>The skill of Drive/Ride/Pilot encompasses the ability to control and maneuver various types of vehicles, ranging from simple mounts to complex machinery like spaceships. This skill includes not just the physical handling but also the situational awareness required to operate these vehicles safely and efficiently.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-driveridepilot-from-fiction">Examples of Drive/Ride/Pilot from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Tom Clancy’s “The Hunt for Red October,” Captain Marko Ramius is an expert in the skill of Drive/Ride/Pilot, specifically in the realm of piloting submarines. As the commander of the Red October, a Soviet Typhoon-class nuclear submarine equipped with a revolutionary propulsion system, Ramius demonstrates not only technical mastery but also exceptional situational awareness. His ability to navigate the complex machinery of the submarine, while also understanding the geopolitical and tactical implications of his actions, sets him apart as a master of his craft.</p>

<p>For example, in a tense sequence, Ramius maneuvers the Red October through a narrow underwater canyon to evade detection by both American and Soviet navies. His skill in piloting is evident as he navigates the treacherous terrain, making split-second adjustments to avoid scraping the hull or triggering underwater mines. His situational awareness is also on display as he anticipates the movements of pursuing vessels, successfully leading them into positions where they can’t easily detect the Red October.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in Drive/Ride/Pilot could offer a range of capabilities to their party. They might be the ace pilot who can navigate a spaceship through an asteroid field, or the skilled driver who can outrun a pursuing enemy in a high-speed chase. Specializations could include expertise in a specific type of vehicle, like submarines or aircraft, or skills in evasive maneuvers that make it difficult for enemies to target or follow them.</p>

<p>Captain Marko Ramius’s skill in piloting adds a layer of depth to his character, elevating him from a mere vehicle operator to a tactician and leader. His expertise is not just a function of his training; it’s a reflection of his strategic mind and his deep understanding of the stakes involved in his actions. This makes him a compelling character whose skills are integral to the unfolding of the high-stakes geopolitical drama in “The Hunt for Red October.”</p>

<h5 id="description-of-ruggedness">Description of Ruggedness</h5>

<p>Ruggedness is the skill associated with physical endurance, resilience, and strength. It comes into play when someone needs to push their body to the limit, whether that’s breaking free from constraints, resisting illness, or participating in feats of physical prowess like drinking contests or forcing open locked doors.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-ruggedness-from-fiction">Examples of Ruggedness from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea,” the protagonist, Santiago, exemplifies the skill of ruggedness. He is an old, experienced fisherman who has gone 84 days without catching a fish but is determined to break his unlucky streak. Santiago’s physical endurance and resilience are put to the ultimate test when he hooks a giant marlin and struggles for days to reel it in. Despite his age and the physical toll the battle takes on him, Santiago’s ruggedness allows him to endure.</p>

<p>For example, during his multi-day struggle with the marlin, Santiago suffers from extreme fatigue, dehydration, and even physical injury as the fishing line cuts into his hands. Yet, he continues to hold onto the line, using his body weight to counter the marlin’s strength. His ruggedness also manifests in his ability to resist despair and maintain focus, drawing on his reserves of mental and emotional strength to keep fighting, even when the odds seem insurmountable.</p>

<p>A character with a specialization in ruggedness could be invaluable in various scenarios. They might be the one to break free from ropes when the party is captured, or resist the effects of a debilitating poison long enough to get to safety. Specializations could include extreme endurance, allowing the character to travel long distances without rest, or incredible resilience, enabling them to recover quickly from injuries or illnesses.</p>

<p>Santiago’s ruggedness adds a profound layer to his character. It’s not just a physical attribute but a testament to his indomitable spirit. His skill in ruggedness is a reflection of his life’s hardships and his unyielding determination to face challenges head-on, no matter how insurmountable they may seem. This makes him not just a skilled fisherman but a compelling symbol of human endurance and resilience.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-unarmed-combat">Description of Unarmed Combat</h5>

<p>Unarmed combat refers to fighting techniques that do not involve the use of weapons. It encompasses a variety of styles, including martial arts, boxing, and wrestling, focusing on strikes, grapples, and defense.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-unarmed-combat-from-fiction">Examples of Unarmed Combat from Fiction</h5>

<p>In Frank Miller’s graphic novel series “Sin City,” the character Marv is a master of unarmed combat. A towering, brutish figure with a penchant for violence, Marv relies on a mix of raw strength and street-fighting techniques to overpower his enemies. His style is less about finesse and more about overwhelming force, but it’s highly effective. He’s adept at using his fists, elbows, and even his head to deliver punishing blows, and he’s equally skilled at grappling techniques that allow him to subdue opponents quickly.</p>

<p>For example, in “The Hard Goodbye,” the first story of the “Sin City” series, Marv finds himself surrounded by a group of armed thugs. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, he uses his unarmed combat skills to neutralize the threat. He disarms one opponent with a swift strike, then uses a grappling move to incapacitate another. His ability to switch between striking and grappling techniques allows him to adapt to the situation and come out on top, even when the odds are against him.</p>

<p>A character specialized in unarmed combat could offer a unique set of skills to their party. They might be the one to disarm a dangerous enemy in close quarters, or use their grappling skills to restrain a foe so that allies can deal with them more easily. Specializations could include specific martial arts styles, like judo or Muay Thai, or focus on particular aspects of unarmed combat like striking or ground control.</p>

<p>Marv’s expertise in unarmed combat adds a gritty, visceral layer to his character. It’s a reflection of his harsh environment and his own uncompromising nature. His skills are not just for show; they’re essential for his survival in the brutal world of “Sin City.” This makes him not only an effective combatant but also a compelling character whose abilities are integral to his identity and the challenges he faces.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-social-sciences">Description of Social Sciences</h6>

<p>Social sciences encompass the study of human society, behavior, and social interactions, often through systematic methods of empirical investigation and analysis. Social Science skills can be useful in TTRPGs when the party needs to understand a society quickly to navigate its complexities, when forming alliances, or when trying to alter the course of events within a community. It could also help in interpreting historical texts, solving social dilemmas, or predicting the behavior of NPCs.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-social-sciences-from-fiction">Examples of Social Sciences from Fiction</h6>

<p>In George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series, Tyrion Lannister is a character who excels in the social sciences, particularly in the realms of politics, history, and psychology. Born into one of the most powerful families in the Seven Kingdoms, Tyrion has a keen understanding of social dynamics, power structures, and human behavior. His ability to read people and situations gives him a unique advantage in the cutthroat world of Westerosi politics.</p>

<p>For example, in “A Clash of Kings,” Tyrion is appointed as Hand of the King and quickly finds himself having to navigate the complex political landscape of King’s Landing. Using his understanding of social sciences, he forms alliances with key players, manipulates his enemies into weakening positions, and even restructures the city’s defenses. His knowledge of history and past conflicts allows him to anticipate his adversaries’ moves, while his understanding of psychology helps him manipulate them to his advantage.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a specialization in social sciences could be invaluable for various scenarios. They might be the one to broker an alliance between warring factions by understanding their cultural values and historical grievances. Or they could predict the likely moves of an enemy leader based on a deep understanding of political strategy and human behavior. Specializations could include expertise in a particular culture’s history, skills in diplomacy, or a focus on psychological manipulation.</p>

<p>Tyrion Lannister’s proficiency in the social sciences adds a rich layer of complexity to his character. It’s not just a tool for political maneuvering; it’s a reflection of his intellectual curiosity and his adaptability in a world that often underestimates him. His skills in the social sciences are not just practical assets; they are integral to his identity and his ability to survive and thrive in a world rife with social and political complexities.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-life-sciences">Description of Life Sciences</h6>

<p>Life Sciences encompass the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. This skill covers a broad range of knowledge and applications, from medical treatments to bioengineering, and is crucial in both everyday life and specialized professions.  In a TTRPG conflict resolution, Life Sciences could be used to identify the nature of a mysterious disease affecting a town, or to concoct an antidote for a rare poison. A specialized character might even perform surgery under combat conditions.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-life-sciences-from-fiction">Examples of Life Sciences from Fiction</h6>

<p>In the fantasy series “The Kingkiller Chronicle” by Patrick Rothfuss, the protagonist Kvothe demonstrates a strong aptitude for life sciences, particularly in the realm of alchemy and medicine. Trained at the University, Kvothe gains a deep understanding of various herbs, chemicals, and biological processes. This knowledge proves invaluable on multiple occasions throughout his adventures.</p>

<p>For example, in “The Wise Man’s Fear,” Kvothe encounters a town plagued by a mysterious illness. Using his understanding of life sciences, he is able to identify the disease’s origin and suggest a course of action to treat the afflicted, saving lives in the process. His skills also extend to the creation of antidotes and medicines, which come in handy when dealing with poisons or other harmful substances.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a specialization in life sciences could perform similar feats. They might identify a rare plant in a forest that can be used to cure a debilitating disease affecting a nearby village. Or, in a more combat-oriented scenario, they could quickly assess a wounded ally’s condition and perform emergency surgery to remove an embedded arrowhead, thereby preventing further damage or infection.</p>

<p>Kvothe’s proficiency in life sciences not only adds depth to his character but also provides him with practical skills that are crucial for his survival and the well-being of those around him.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-physical-sciencessurvival">Description of Physical Sciences/Survival</h6>

<p>Physical Sciences/Survival encompasses the scientific knowledge and practical skills needed for understanding the natural world and surviving in various environments. This skill set ranges from academic disciplines like chemistry and geology to practical survival techniques like tracking and fishing. Physical Sciences/Survival skill can be crucial in various conflict resolutions. For instance, characters might use Meteorology to predict an incoming storm to gain a tactical advantage, or Urban Survival to navigate through a dangerous cityscape evading capture. This skill set can offer creative ways to solve problems and overcome challenges in both natural and urban environments.  Your Physical Sciences check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, the weather, and natural cycles as well as perform mathematical operations. You might be asked to make a Survival check to navigate and find a path within a given environment, follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that Beakclaw live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. This skill is also used in urban environments to survive on the streets and to live within that environment.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-physical-sciencessurvival-from-fiction">Examples of Physical Sciences/Survival from Fiction</h6>

<p>In Brandon Sanderson’s “The Stormlight Archive,” Kaladin Stormblessed is a character who excels in the skill of Physical Sciences/Survival. Raised in a rural village and trained as a soldier, Kaladin has a broad range of knowledge and skills that help him survive in various environments, from the harsh conditions of the Shattered Plains to the complexities of a military camp. His understanding of the natural world, including weather patterns and terrain, is complemented by his practical skills like tracking and first aid.</p>

<p>For example, in “The Way of Kings,” the first book in the series, Kaladin uses his understanding of meteorology to predict the arrival of a Highstorm, a devastating weather phenomenon. This knowledge allows him to prepare his men and find shelter, thereby saving lives. Later, in “Words of Radiance,” he uses his survival skills to navigate the treacherous landscape of the Shattered Plains, identifying safe paths and avoiding natural hazards like chasms and rockslides. His ability to read the environment and make quick, informed decisions is a key factor in his effectiveness as a leader.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a specialization in Physical Sciences/Survival could offer a wide range of problem-solving options. They might use their knowledge of geology to find a hidden cave for shelter, or apply their understanding of chemistry to create makeshift explosives. Specializations could include wilderness survival, allowing the character to find food and water in a forest, or urban survival, enabling them to navigate a city’s underworld without attracting unwanted attention.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-the-traditions-skill">Description of the Traditions skill</h6>

<p>The Traditions skill encompasses a deep understanding of cultural norms, social etiquettes, and bureaucratic systems within various groups and organizations. Possessing this skill allows individuals to navigate complex social situations with ease, whether dealing with different ethnicities, religious communities, governmental bodies, or informal social circles. It enables them to grasp the unspoken rules, greetings, taboos, and bureaucratic requirements crucial for successful interactions, ensuring smooth dealings and favorable outcomes.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-traditions-from-fiction">Examples of Traditions from Fiction</h6>

<p>In the fantasy series “A Song of Ice and Fire” by George R.R. Martin, Daenerys Targaryen demonstrates a remarkable aptitude for understanding and adapting to various traditions and cultural norms as she journeys across different lands. Initially a naive young girl, Daenerys evolves into a savvy leader partly because of her skill in “Traditions,” as it might be termed in a TTRPG setting. This skill becomes evident as she navigates the complex social landscapes of the Dothraki, the people of Slaver’s Bay, and various other groups she encounters.</p>

<p>For instance, when Daenerys is married off to Khal Drogo, a leader of the Dothraki, she initially struggles with the unfamiliar customs and traditions of her new people. However, she quickly learns their ways, from their warrior ethos to their religious practices, and uses this knowledge to gain their respect and eventually lead them. Her understanding of Dothraki traditions allows her to challenge existing norms, such as the treatment of women and slaves, without entirely alienating the tribe.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a high level of skill in Traditions could be invaluable for various quests and interactions. Suppose the party is trying to gain the favor of a reclusive elven community. In that case, a character skilled in Traditions could guide the group through the complex social etiquette required, from the proper forms of address to the subtle nuances of elven gift-giving, thereby ensuring a more favorable outcome.</p>

<p>Daenerys’s ability to understand and adapt to different traditions is a cornerstone of her leadership style. It enables her to unite disparate groups under her banner, from Dothraki horse lords to freed slaves. Her skill in Traditions allows her to navigate complex social terrains, earning her allies where others might find only enemies. This skill becomes one of her most potent tools in her quest to reclaim the Iron Throne, demonstrating the power of cultural understanding in achieving one’s goals.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-the-perception-skill">Description of the Perception skill</h6>

<p>The Perception skill represents an individual’s heightened awareness and keenness of their senses, enabling them to spot, hear, or detect the presence of concealed or obscured elements in their surroundings. This skill is crucial for eavesdropping on conversations, detecting hidden threats, and noticing subtle clues or danger in various environments. Whether it’s spotting lurking enemies in the shadows or identifying concealed objects behind closed doors, Perception allows characters to remain vigilant and attentive to their environment.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-perception-from-fiction">Examples of Perception from Fiction</h6>

<p>In the classic mystery fiction series featuring Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the titular character is the epitome of heightened Perception. Holmes’s keen observational skills are legendary, allowing him to spot clues and details that even trained investigators often overlook. Whether he’s at a crime scene, in his Baker Street apartment, or walking through the streets of London, Holmes’s Perception is always at work, helping him solve some of the most baffling cases.</p>

<p>For instance, in “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” Holmes quickly deduces the presence of a dangerous snake in a locked room, a clue that had eluded everyone else. His Perception allows him to notice subtle details like the arrangement of a bell-pull, the presence of saucer of milk, and the peculiar construction of a bed, all of which contribute to solving the mystery. Holmes’s ability to perceive what others cannot is not limited to visual clues; he also has an acute sense of hearing, which he uses to eavesdrop on conversations or detect someone’s approach.</p>

<p>In a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) setting, a character with a high level of Perception skill would be invaluable in a mystery or investigation scenario. Imagine the party is trying to solve a murder in a haunted mansion; a Perception check could reveal hidden compartments, overlooked clues, or even the faint sound of someone else in the house. This skill would be crucial for piecing together evidence, avoiding traps, and ultimately solving the mystery at hand.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes’s extraordinary Perception is not just a skill but an art form, honed through years of observation and logical deduction. It’s this keen awareness that sets him apart as one of the greatest detectives in literary history. Whether he’s solving a complex murder case or simply observing the people around him, Holmes’s Perception allows him to see the world in a way that few others can, making him an enduring symbol of the power of observation and attention to detail.</p>

<h6 id="description-of-the-insight-skill">Description of the Insight skill</h6>

<p>Insight measures the ability to discern the true intentions and emotions of others, utilizing keen observation, intuition, and analysis of verbal and non-verbal cues. It involves reading between the lines, perceiving subtle changes in behavior, and understanding the unspoken motivations of individuals.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-insight-from-fiction">Examples of Insight from Fiction</h6>

<p>In the science fiction series “Dune” by Frank Herbert, Paul Atreides exhibits an extraordinary level of insight, honed by a combination of his Bene Gesserit training and his own innate abilities. Paul’s skill in discerning the true intentions and emotions of others is almost uncanny, allowing him to navigate the complex political and social landscapes of his universe. Whether he’s interpreting the subtle body language of a potential ally or detecting the hidden motives behind a seemingly straightforward proposal, Paul’s insight is one of his most potent tools.</p>

<p>One notable instance occurs in “Dune” when Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, are taken captive by the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis. Despite being in a perilous situation, Paul uses his insight to quickly gauge the dynamics within the Fremen tribe, identifying who holds real power and who can be trusted. His ability to read between the lines during conversations and negotiations not only earns him the respect of the Fremen but also allows him to rise to a position of leadership among them.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a high level of insight could be invaluable for various aspects of gameplay. They might be able to discern that an NPC is lying about the location of a hidden treasure, or sense that a supposed ally is actually a traitor. An Insight check could be used to determine the success of these intuitive leaps, influencing the party’s decisions and potentially saving them from traps, betrayals, or poor choices.</p>

<p>Paul Atreides’ mastery of insight is not just a passive skill but an active tool he employs to shape events around him. His ability to understand the unspoken motivations and hidden agendas of those he interacts with gives him a significant advantage in the intricate power games he finds himself a part of. Whether he’s facing political intrigue, complex negotiations, or potential combat, Paul’s insight often provides him the edge he needs to come out on top.</p>

<p>When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Investigation check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.</p>

<h6 id="examples-of-investigation-from-fiction">Examples of Investigation from Fiction</h6>

<p>In the classic Western novel “True Grit” by Charles Portis, U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn demonstrates a keen sense of investigation. Though he’s primarily known for his grit and gunfighting skills, Cogburn’s ability to track down outlaws also relies heavily on his investigative prowess. Whether he’s following a trail through rugged terrain or piecing together clues from a crime scene, Cogburn uses his experience and intuition to make educated deductions.</p>

<p>One memorable scene involves Cogburn arriving at an abandoned cabin where he suspects an outlaw is hiding. Instead of rushing in guns blazing, he takes a moment to investigate. He observes the tracks leading into the cabin, the state of the horses tied outside, and even the smoke coming from the chimney. These clues allow him to deduce not only that the outlaw is indeed inside but also that he’s likely alone and unaware of his pursuers. This Investigation check, so to speak, enables Cogburn to plan his approach more strategically, ultimately leading to the successful capture of the outlaw.</p>

<p>In a TTRPG setting, a character with a high level of Investigation skill could be invaluable in a Western-themed campaign. Imagine the party is tracking down a notorious bandit; an Investigation check could reveal that the tracks they are following are actually a decoy, saving them valuable time and resources. Or perhaps the group finds themselves in a seemingly deserted mining town; a successful Investigation check could uncover clues leading to a hidden stash of gold or the lair of the bandits who raided the town.</p>

<p>Rooster Cogburn’s investigative skills complement his more overt abilities, making him a well-rounded character capable of both action and thoughtful analysis. His knack for investigation doesn’t just make him a better lawman; it often gives him the upper hand in dangerous situations, allowing him to outthink as well as outshoot his enemies. This balance of brawn and brain makes the skill of Investigation a critical tool in the arsenal of any gunslinger, sheriff, or bounty hunter in the Wild West.</p>

<h2 id="mystical-aspects">Mystical Aspects</h2>

<h3 id="skepticism-characteristics">Skepticism Characteristics</h3>

<p>In the realm of Skepticism, you will encounter three distinct branches: Arcane, Gnostic, and Chaos.</p>

<p>As a practitioner of Arcane magic, you wield precise and structured spells, relying on the manipulation of mystical symbols and energies. Your skepticism keeps you grounded, approaching magic with a methodical and analytical mindset, seeking to understand its underlying principles and laws.</p>

<p>Moving on to Gnostic magic, you delve deep into esoteric knowledge and hidden truths. You see magic as a path to higher consciousness and self-discovery. Your skepticism here is a tool for discerning genuine wisdom from mere illusions, as you navigate the complexities of mystical realms, seeking illumination and personal growth.</p>

<p>Then comes Chaos magic, where skepticism takes a different turn. Rather than seeking well-defined systems, you embrace the unpredictable and chaotic nature of magic itself. You find power in the fluidity of belief and the ability to shift paradigms, drawing from various traditions and symbols without becoming tied to any one of them. Your skepticism becomes a weapon against dogma, allowing you to remain adaptable and open-minded.</p>

<h4 id="spells-of-the-skeptic">Spells of the Skeptic</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arcane Dissection:</strong> Analyze and deconstruct complex magical spells or enchantments to understand their underlying mechanisms and weaknesses.</li>
  <li><strong>Gnostic Insight:</strong> Tap into your higher consciousness to gain profound insights into mystical truths and hidden knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Chaos Infusion:</strong> Harness the power of chaos to enhance unpredictability and adaptability in your spells, confounding opponents and destabilizing magical constructs.</li>
  <li><strong>Reality Distortion:</strong> Temporarily alter the perception of reality around you, creating illusions that challenge the senses and perceptions of others.</li>
  <li><strong>Skeptic’s Aura:</strong> Create a field of skeptical energy that weakens or nullifies the magical effects of others within its radius.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision Binding:</strong> Craft intricate magical barriers or bindings with precise geometrical symbols, making them more resilient and challenging to break.</li>
  <li><strong>Gnostic Resonance:</strong> Establish a psychic connection with other Gnostic practitioners, allowing for the exchange of knowledge and insights.</li>
  <li><strong>Chaos Merge:</strong> Temporarily blend multiple magical traditions or paradigms, combining their strengths into a potent and unpredictable fusion.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytical Recall:</strong> Enhance your memory and recall abilities, enabling you to store and access vast amounts of magical knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Skeptic’s Disguise:</strong> Conceal your magical presence from others, appearing as a non-magical individual to avoid detection or unwanted attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Elemental Deciphering:</strong> Analyze and understand the elemental composition of objects or magical phenomena, unraveling their intrinsic properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Gnostic Empathy:</strong> Develop a heightened understanding of others’ emotions and intentions, aiding in negotiations and detecting hidden agendas.</li>
  <li><strong>Chaos Confluence:</strong> Merge the energies of chaos into your spells, enhancing their versatility and adaptability on the fly.</li>
  <li><strong>Rational Shielding:</strong> Create magical barriers based on logical principles, making them more resistant to manipulation or exploitation.</li>
  <li><strong>Skeptic’s Rejection:</strong> Nullify the effects of illusions or deceptive magic, seeing through false appearances and revealing the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a Skepticism practitioner, your spells are fueled by intellectual curiosity, rationality, and the pursuit of understanding. These unique spells reflect your approach to magic, allowing you to question, analyze, and adapt your mystical abilities in unique and intriguing ways.</p>

<p>TODO: Fix this</p>

<p>In the realm of Arcane magic and mysticism, you become a master of invisible threads, bridging reality and imagination. As you journey deeper into this esoteric world, you unlock the secrets of the cosmos, wielding raw energies and shaping them into powerful manifestations. Incantations and spellcasting become your forte, as your words resonate with the universe, giving you the ability to reshape the world around you. Yet, this path demands precision and control, for the untamed forces you wield can easily turn against you. As you seek to master the Arcane, you must cultivate inner balance and  mindfulness, attuning yourself to the interconnectedness of all things. Through encounters with fellow seekers and experienced mages, you gather wisdom, but the journey remains your own to chart. Ultimately, being an Arcane mage transcends mere power and knowledge. It is a journey of self-discovery and understanding, where you become a beacon of mystic wisdom and a guardian of the sacred secrets that shape existence itself.</p>

<p>Shamanism is a profound branch of magic that involves becoming a conduit between the physical and metaphysical realms. As a shaman, you deeply connect with the natural world, recognizing the sacredness of nature and the energies that bind all living beings. Your journey involves mastering rituals and techniques to communicate with spirits, forming relationships with them to harness their powers.</p>

<p>In Shamanism, you enter altered states of consciousness through various methods like meditation, drumming, or dancing. In these trance-like states, you can traverse the ethereal plane to seek guidance, healing, and answers. As you develop your abilities, you become a spiritual leader, offering counsel and mediating conflicts between individuals and spirits.</p>

<p>The practice of Shamanism requires a profound sense of humility and respect for the spirits and the natural world. You embrace the responsibility of maintaining harmony with the ecosystem and fostering reverence for the interconnected web of life. Your role as a shaman is that of a guardian, a healer, and a spiritual guide, guided by the ethereal forces that shape the cosmos.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-style-skill">Description of Style Skill</h5>

<p>Style is the ability to understand the mindset of the public or a specific audience and skillfully create cultural artifacts, such as dresses, paintings, sculptures, poems, or other artistic pursuits, to delight and captivate them. It involves a keen sense of aesthetics, creativity, and the capacity to evoke emotions through artistic expression.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-style-from-fiction">Examples of Style from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the classic novel “The Picture of Dorian Gray” by Oscar Wilde, the character Lord Henry Wotton exhibits a unique mastery of Style, although not in the form of physical artifacts. Lord Henry is a connoisseur of wit, aesthetics, and the human condition, and he uses his understanding of these elements to captivate and influence those around him, particularly the protagonist, Dorian Gray. His keen sense of what will intrigue, delight, or shock his audience allows him to craft conversations and ideas as if they were works of art.</p>

<p>Lord Henry’s Style is evident in the way he effortlessly navigates social gatherings, always knowing the right thing to say to provoke thought, laughter, or introspection. His understanding of the mindset of his audience—whether it’s a room full of socialites or a young, impressionable man like Dorian—enables him to tailor his expressions for maximum impact. He is a master at evoking emotions and reactions, using his words and ideas as his medium.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Style could be invaluable in various social scenarios. Imagine the party needs to win the favor of a fickle noble; a character skilled in Style could create a poem, painting, or even a performance tailored to the noble’s specific tastes and sensibilities, thereby gaining his favor. Alternatively, the character could use their understanding of aesthetics and public sentiment to craft propaganda that sways public opinion in favor of the party’s cause.</p>

<p>Lord Henry’s mastery of Style makes him one of the most memorable and influential characters in “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” His ability to understand and manipulate the emotional and aesthetic sensibilities of those around him gives him a form of power that is as potent as it is subtle. Whether he’s shaping the life philosophy of a young man or captivating an entire room with his wit, Lord Henry’s skill in Style is both his weapon and his art form, making him a compelling figure in both the story and the broader discussions it provokes.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-performance-skill">Description of the Performance skill</h5>

<p>Performance is the ability to captivate and delight an audience through various forms of entertainment, such as music, dance, acting, storytelling, or other artistic expressions. It involves a combination of talent, skill, charisma, and stage presence to evoke emotions, engage the audience, and leave a lasting impression.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-performance-from-fiction">Examples of Performance from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the fantasy series “The Kingkiller Chronicle” by Patrick Rothfuss, the protagonist Kvothe is an exceptionally gifted performer. From a young age, he is trained in the Edema Ruh, a group of traveling performers known for their storytelling, music, and acting. Kvothe’s Performance skill is not just a hobby or a pastime; it’s an integral part of his identity and a crucial tool for survival. Whether he’s playing the lute in a tavern for tips or using storytelling to captivate a hostile audience, Kvothe’s performances are imbued with a unique blend of skill, charisma, and emotional depth.</p>

<p>One memorable scene occurs in “The Name of the Wind,” where Kvothe participates in a musical competition at the Eolian, a prestigious venue. Despite having a damaged lute with only six strings, Kvothe delivers a performance so emotionally powerful and technically flawless that he not only wins the competition but also gains his talent pipes, a mark of extraordinary musical ability. His performance evokes a range of emotions from the audience, from sorrow to exhilaration, leaving an indelible impression on all who hear him.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Performance could be invaluable in various scenarios. Imagine the party needs to distract a group of guards while their comrades sneak into a fortress; a Performance check could determine whether the character successfully holds the guards’ attention with a riveting tale or a captivating song. Alternatively, the character could use their Performance skills to win over a crowd, swaying public opinion or even inciting a rebellion against a tyrannical ruler.</p>

<p>Kvothe’s mastery of Performance serves multiple functions throughout his journey. It provides him with a means of livelihood, a way to connect with others, and even a method of self-expression and healing. His ability to captivate and move audiences is not just a testament to his technical skill but also to his understanding of the human condition. Whether he’s strumming a lute or weaving a tale, Kvothe’s performances are a fusion of artistry and emotion, making him one of the most compelling figures in modern fantasy literature.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-etiquette-skill">Description of the Etiquette skill</h5>

<p>Etiquette is the art of knowing and applying the proper social customs, protocols, and behaviors in various situations to interact gracefully with individuals from different backgrounds. It involves understanding the appropriate ways to communicate, behave, and show respect to others, ensuring smooth interactions and fostering positive relationships.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-etiquette-from-fiction">Examples of Etiquette from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the classic novel “Pride and Prejudice” by Jane Austen, Elizabeth Bennet demonstrates a nuanced understanding of Etiquette, especially given the social constraints and expectations of her time. While she is not afraid to challenge societal norms, Elizabeth knows how to navigate various social situations gracefully, understanding when to adhere to protocol and when it’s acceptable to bend the rules. Her skill in Etiquette is evident in her interactions with a range of characters, from the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh to the charming but deceitful George Wickham, and of course, the enigmatic Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>One memorable scene that showcases Elizabeth’s grasp of Etiquette occurs during her visit to Rosings, the grand estate of Lady Catherine. Despite Lady Catherine’s attempts to belittle her and assert her own superiority, Elizabeth manages to hold her own, responding with just the right blend of deference and assertiveness. She adheres to the social customs of the time, yet does so in a way that maintains her self-respect and dignity, impressing even Mr. Darcy in the process.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Etiquette could be invaluable for navigating complex social landscapes. Imagine the party is invited to a royal ball where they must secure an alliance with a foreign power. A character skilled in Etiquette could guide the group through the intricacies of courtly behavior, from the proper way to address nobility to the subtle art of diplomatic conversation, thereby increasing the chances of a successful negotiation.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bennet’s mastery of Etiquette is not just about following rules; it’s about understanding the nuances of human interaction within the context of her society. Her ability to read the room, so to speak, allows her to adapt her behavior according to the situation, whether she’s challenging social norms or adhering to them. This skill enables her to navigate a rigid social hierarchy without compromising her own values, making her one of the most enduring and relatable characters in literary history.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-deception-skill">Description of the Deception Skill</h5>

<p>The Deception skill measures the ability to convincingly hide the truth, whether through verbal means or actions. This skill encompasses a wide range of deceptive practices, from misleading others through ambiguity to outright lying. Characters proficient in Deception can fast-talk guards, con merchants, earn money through gambling, pass themselves off in disguises, offer false assurances to dull suspicions, or maintain a straight face while telling blatant lies.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-deception-from-fiction">Examples of Deception from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the fantasy series “A Song of Ice and Fire” by George R.R. Martin, Petyr Baelish, commonly known as Littlefinger, is a master of Deception. His ability to manipulate, lie, and mislead others is unparalleled, making him one of the most dangerous players in the game of thrones. Littlefinger’s skill in Deception is evident in almost every interaction he has, whether he’s sowing discord among powerful families, manipulating financial markets, or plotting assassinations.</p>

<p>One of Littlefinger’s most memorable acts of deception occurs when he convinces Eddard Stark that he will support him in a coup against Queen Cersei, only to betray him at the last moment. Littlefinger’s assurances are so convincing that even the usually cautious Eddard is taken in. This act of deception has far-reaching consequences, leading to Eddard’s imprisonment and eventual execution, and setting off a chain of events that plunges the Seven Kingdoms into war.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Deception could be invaluable for various scenarios. Imagine the party needs to infiltrate a heavily guarded fortress; a Deception check could determine whether they successfully bluff their way past the guards. Or perhaps the group is caught in a web of political intrigue; a character skilled in Deception could spread misinformation to throw their enemies off balance or create false alliances to further their own goals.</p>

<p>Littlefinger’s mastery of Deception makes him a formidable adversary. His ability to read people and situations allows him to craft lies that are almost indistinguishable from the truth. Whether he’s manipulating the stock market to amass wealth or pitting powerful lords against each other to climb the social ladder, Littlefinger’s deceptive practices are his most potent weapons. His skill in this dark art allows him to navigate the treacherous political landscape of Westeros, leaving a trail of chaos in his wake.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-persuasion-skill">Description of the Persuasion Skill</h5>

<p>Persuasion is the ability to influence others using tact, social graces, and good nature. It involves fostering friendships, making cordial requests, and exhibiting proper etiquette. With persuasion, you can convince people to see things from your perspective, negotiate peace between warring tribes, inspire crowds, or gain favor with influential figures.”</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-persuasion-from-fiction">Examples of Persuasion from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the historical novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, Atticus Finch demonstrates a profound skill in Persuasion. As a lawyer in a racially divided Southern town, Atticus faces the daunting task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Despite the overwhelming prejudice and hostility he faces, Atticus uses his persuasive abilities to make a compelling case for Tom’s innocence, appealing to the jury’s sense of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable scenes showcasing Atticus’s skill in Persuasion is his closing argument in Tom Robinson’s trial. Atticus doesn’t resort to theatrics or manipulation; instead, he calmly lays out the facts of the case, imploring the jury to set aside their biases and consider the evidence before them. He employs a combination of tact, social graces, and a deep understanding of human nature to make his point, even though the odds are heavily stacked against him.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Persuasion could be invaluable in various scenarios. Imagine the party is caught in a tense standoff between two feuding families. A character skilled in Persuasion could step in to mediate, using their social graces and understanding of human nature to broker a peace agreement. Or perhaps the group needs to gain the favor of a powerful queen; a successful Persuasion check could convince her to lend her support to their cause.</p>

<p>Atticus Finch’s mastery of Persuasion is not just a tool for his profession; it’s a guiding principle of his life. He believes in the power of empathy and understanding to bridge the divides between people, and he uses his persuasive abilities to advocate for justice and fairness. Whether he’s defending a client in court or imparting life lessons to his children, Atticus’s skill in Persuasion is a testament to the impact one individual can have when they speak from a place of integrity and compassion.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-intimidation-skill">Description of the Intimidation Skill</h5>

<p>Intimidation is the ability to influence others through overt threats, hostile actions, and displays of physical prowess. It involves using fear and forceful demeanor to coerce others into compliance or submission. Examples of intimidation include extracting information from a prisoner, dissuading street thugs from confrontation, or using menacing gestures to make someone reconsider their decisions.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-intimidation-from-fiction">Examples of Intimidation from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the crime thriller series “The Godfather” by Mario Puzo, Vito Corleone exemplifies the skill of Intimidation. As the patriarch of the Corleone crime family, Vito uses a combination of veiled threats, overt displays of power, and an imposing presence to maintain his family’s influence and control over their criminal enterprises. While he is a man of many talents and strategies, his ability to intimidate is one of his most effective tools for maintaining order and achieving his objectives.</p>

<p>One iconic scene that showcases Vito Corleone’s skill in Intimidation occurs when he visits the office of Jack Woltz, a Hollywood producer who has refused a favor to the Corleone family. Vito starts off with polite conversation, but the underlying threat is palpable. When Woltz remains defiant, Vito ensures that he wakes up the next morning with the severed head of his prized racehorse in his bed. The message is clear and terrifying, and Woltz promptly complies with Vito’s wishes.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Intimidation could be invaluable in various scenarios. Imagine the party is interrogating a captured enemy spy; an Intimidation check could determine whether the spy reveals critical information. Or perhaps the group encounters a band of highway robbers; a successful Intimidation check could make the robbers think twice about attacking, allowing the party to pass unharmed.</p>

<p>Vito Corleone’s mastery of Intimidation is a cornerstone of his power and influence. While he prefers to use diplomacy and mutual benefit to achieve his goals, he is not above using fear and threats when necessary. His ability to intimidate is not just about physical force; it’s a calculated use of his reputation, his resources, and his understanding of human psychology. Whether he’s negotiating business deals or settling disputes, Vito Corleone’s skill in Intimidation ensures that he commands respect and compliance, making him one of the most formidable figures in the world of organized crime.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-bureaucracy">Description of the Bureaucracy</h5>

<p>The skill Bureaucracy means you understand the bureaucratic structures of a group and how they can be used to create the outcomes you need. This can be understanding how local politicians work, how to incentivize law enforcement, or the rules of churches or other formalized social structures of a corporation or social group.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-bureaucracy-from-fiction">Examples of Bureaucracy from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the political drama series “The West Wing,” created by Aaron Sorkin, the character of C.J. Cregg, the White House Press Secretary, demonstrates a deep understanding of Bureaucracy. C.J. navigates the intricate web of governmental structures, from the Executive Branch to Congress, and even the media, to achieve her objectives. Whether she’s managing a crisis, coordinating with various departments, or handling sensitive information, C.J.’s skill in Bureaucracy is evident in how she leverages the system to her advantage.</p>

<p>One memorable episode showcases C.J.’s bureaucratic acumen when she has to manage a diplomatic crisis involving a foreign dignitary. Understanding the protocols, the chain of command, and the sensitivities of various departments, she orchestrates a series of meetings and briefings to ensure that the crisis is resolved with minimal political fallout. Her ability to work the bureaucratic system enables her to bring together State Department officials, National Security advisors, and even the President in a coordinated response.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Bureaucracy could be invaluable for navigating complex social structures. Imagine the party needs to secure a permit for a magical experiment in a city where magic is heavily regulated. A character skilled in Bureaucracy could expedite the process, knowing which officials to talk to and what strings to pull. Or perhaps the group is involved in a dispute with a local guild; understanding the guild’s internal rules and hierarchy could give the party an edge in negotiations or legal proceedings.</p>

<p>C.J. Cregg’s mastery of Bureaucracy is a cornerstone of her effectiveness as a Press Secretary and later as the White House Chief of Staff. Her ability to understand and manipulate the bureaucratic system allows her to achieve outcomes that would be difficult, if not impossible, for others less skilled in the art of bureaucracy. Whether she’s managing a crisis, shaping policy, or simply navigating the day-to-day challenges of government</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-animal-handling">Description of the Animal Handling</h5>

<p>The skill Animal Handling means when there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, you might need an Animal Handling check. You also make an Animal Handling check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-animal-handling-from-fiction">Examples of Animal Handling from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the classic novel “Black Beauty” by Anna Sewell, the character John Manly, the stablemaster, demonstrates a high level of skill in Animal Handling. John is responsible for the care and training of the horses in the estate, including the titular character, Black Beauty. His understanding of equine behavior, needs, and body language allows him to establish a strong bond with the animals under his care. He knows when to be firm and when to be gentle, and his actions are always guided by a deep respect for the animals.</p>

<p>One memorable scene in the book showcases John’s skill in Animal Handling when a fire breaks out in the stable. Understanding the horses’ natural fear and the risk of a stampede, John calmly but quickly leads each horse out of the burning stable, even going back to rescue a terrified, rearing horse that others had given up on. His ability to read the animals’ behavior and respond appropriately ensures the safety of all the horses.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Animal Handling could be invaluable in various scenarios. Imagine the party needs to cross a dangerous swamp inhabited by aggressive creatures; an Animal Handling check could determine whether they successfully tame or calm the creatures to pass safely. Or perhaps the group encounters a pack of wolves; a successful Animal Handling check could prevent an attack, turning a potential threat into a momentary distraction.</p>

<p>John Manly’s mastery of Animal Handling is not just a professional requirement but a moral commitment to the well-being of the animals under his care. Whether he’s training a young colt or calming a spooked mare, his skill in Animal Handling is rooted in a deep understanding of animal psychology and needs. This makes him not only effective in his role but also beloved by the animals he tends to, showcasing the profound impact that skilled animal handling can have.</p>

<h5 id="description-of-the-leadership">Description of the Leadership</h5>

<p>The Leadership skill is the ability to inspire others to become the best versions of themselves, guiding and motivating them towards a common goal while fostering a positive and empowering environment.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-leadership-from-fiction">Examples of Leadership from Fiction</h5>

<p>In the historical drama “Braveheart,” directed by and starring Mel Gibson, the character William Wallace exemplifies the skill of Leadership. Wallace, a Scottish knight, leads his countrymen in a rebellion against the oppressive rule of the English King Edward I. His ability to inspire, motivate, and unite people from various walks of life is nothing short of extraordinary. Wallace doesn’t just lead by giving orders; he leads by example, fighting alongside his men and sharing in their hardships.</p>

<p>One of the most iconic scenes that showcase Wallace’s Leadership skill is his speech before the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Faced with a demoralized and vastly outnumbered army, Wallace rides along the front lines, instilling a sense of purpose and courage in his men. His impassioned words, “They may take our lives, but they’ll never take our freedom!” resonate deeply, transforming a ragtag group of farmers and tradesmen into a focused, cohesive fighting force. The subsequent victory against the English becomes a turning point in the Scottish rebellion and solidifies Wallace’s reputation as a formidable leader.</p>

<p>A character with a high level of skill in Leadership could be invaluable for rallying the party in times of crisis or motivating them to undertake challenging quests. Imagine the group is demoralized after a series of setbacks; a Leadership check could restore their confidence and resolve, improving their performance in future challenges. Or perhaps the party needs to lead a group of untrained villagers in defense of their homes; a successful Leadership check could turn the tide of battle, inspiring the villagers to fight with newfound courage.</p>

<p>William Wallace’s mastery of Leadership is not just about tactical acumen or battlefield heroics; it’s about the ability to inspire and elevate those around him. Whether he’s rallying his troops for battle or standing up for the rights and freedoms of his countrymen, Wallace’s leadership skills are his most potent weapon. His ability to inspire courage and unity in the face of overwhelming odds makes him not just a great warrior but a truly transformative leader.</p>

<h4 id="degrees-of-effect-defined">Degrees of Effect Defined</h4>

<p>There are nine separate ways a predicament can be resolved:</p>

<h5 id="fail-catastrophically">Fail Catastrophically</h5>

<p>This is a critical failure. The cost for this sort of failure means the outcome the actor was intending failed. Additionally, things have turned worse for that actor as well in unrelated areas or with a sense of
finality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, if a thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door, then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock. The trap in the door was triggered. Everyone in The Company must now determine if they are now poisoned, and no further attempts may be made (finality). In the event that overcoming this complication was required for The Company to accomplish their overall objectives, the GM must instead make the events turn to the worse in other areas. In the above example this would mean that in their attempts to pick the lock, the thief slipped, and knocked the torch out of the hands of the person carrying it, and the tapestry the door is behind is now on fire. Or the torch is now out and no one can see. The idea here is to heighten tension and make the attempt require larger efforts of heroics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="costly">Costly</h5>

<p>This is one step away from a critical failure. The cost should be
related to the outcome the player or monster was attempting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, if the thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door, then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock, but they did trigger the trap in the door, and everyone in The Company must now determine if they are poisoned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fail">Fail</h5>

<p>This is a normal failure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the example of our thief would not have been able to pick the lock, but the lock would not be jammed, and he would still have his pick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fail-in-style">Fail in Style</h5>

<p>This is one step above a failure. It is still a failure, but something else has happened that moves the story forward in a more difficult path, but without accomplishing the goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the example of the thief, he wouldn’t have picked the lock, but he did spring the trap and the door was opened, but everyone in The Company must determine if they are poisoned. This is the classic fail forward approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tie">Tie</h5>

<p>A tie succeeds unless this was a contest between two parties, in which case the outcome is that neither party gets what they want, and it should be treated as a fail in style for both sides. This is useful for social interactions or for contests of strength or agility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the example of our thief the parties in question are the designer of the lock or door and The Company trying to get in. The thief would not get what they want, the lock to be picked, and the designer of the lock would not get what they want, to keep the lock secure. The resolution on this would be that the thief can’t open the lock with this action, but he has gained knowledge of the lock, which will make it easier for him next time. This wouldn’t be a problem for the thief unless he was doing this under a stress.</p>

<h5 id="succeed-in-style">Succeed in Style</h5>

<p>The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out to do, and they got some hidden bonus or style out of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how that lock is constructed and the next one that is just like it will be easier to open.</p>

<p>The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out todo, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it.</p>

  <p>In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any lock within this facility will be easier to open.</p>

<h5 id="serendipitous-success">Serendipitous Success</h5>

<p>The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out to do, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it that is completely unrelated to the task being attempted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any lock within this facility will be easier to open. In addition, the thief see’s the trap on the door as well and has a normal success to disarm it. The best way to see a serendipitous success is to see this as two completely independent successes on one die roll. In the event that a complication requires more than one success a serendipitous success will, in addition to everything above, add an additional success to the success pool.</p>

In my role, I offer strategic guidance on all software and products developed in IT to executives, senior leadership, and business stakeholders, drawing on my 25 years of experience at SCE.</li>

                  <li class="mb-2">I love working in technology as it provides me with the opportunity to watch the future unfold. Some of the things I have worked on were considered science-fiction when I was in school. This means I get to work on hard problems with brilliant people using complex and cool tools.</li>
