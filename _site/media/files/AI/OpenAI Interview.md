# Model Development & Releases

## GPT-5 & Future Models

> **Q: What's the rough timeline for GPT-5o?**
>
> **A:** "I think we'll just call it GPT-5, not GPT-5o. Don't have a timeline yet."

---

> **Q: When will we see ChatGPT-5?**
>
> **A:** "Soon after o-17 micro and GPT-(π+1)."

---

> **Q: Internally, which model are you at? o4, o5, o6? How much more intelligent are the models internally compared to o3?**
>
> **A:** "We've lost count over here."

## Current Models & Updates

> **Q: When will the full O3 debut?**
>
> **A:** "I'd guess more than a few weeks, less than a few months."

---

> **Q: Is 4o going to get any big improvements?**
>
> **A:** "Yes, we're not done with the 4o series!"

---

> **Q: Why does o3-mini still have a knowledge cutoff of October 2023?**
>
> **A:** "Now that we have enabled search this matters much less -- in my own use, I never think about the knowledge cutoff anymore. We are working on updating knowledge cutoffs, but in the meantime, o3-mini can browse the web. Plus and Team users have up to 150 messages per day with o3-mini and 50 messages per week on o3-mini-high. Pro users have unlimited access to o3-mini-high."

# Features & Capabilities

## Context Window

> **Q: Are there future plans to solve the limited context window problem? Can we expect 1M context anytime soon?**
>
> **A:** "We are working on increasing context length. Don't have a clear date/announcement yet."

---

> **Q: When will you improve the context of the models?**
>
> **A:** "Working on it! Long context is a top focus for my team right now."

## Image Generation & Vision

> **Q: Are you still planning to roll out the 4o image generator?**
>
> **A:** "Yes! We're working on it. And I think it's going to be worth the wait. It will be available in a couple of months."

---

> **Q: Any upcoming plans for image generation?**
>
> **A:** "Yes! We're working on it. And I think it's going to be worth the wait."

---

> **Q: What happened to the native multimodal image generation & editing that was supposed to come out with GPT-4o?**
>
> **A:** "It's coming! We're working on it. And I think it's going to be worth the wait."

---

> **Q: Will o3-mini have vision any time soon?**
>
> **A:** "We're working on bringing reasoning to mini. For now, try o1!"

## Voice & Interface Features

> **Q: Will there be updates to advance voice mode?**
>
> **A:** "Yes, updates to advance voice mode coming!"

---

> **Q: Please allow us to interact with text & canvas while using advanced voice.**
>
> **A:** "Yes! We have a lot of good tools that were built somewhat independently — goal is to get them in your hands as fast as possible. The next step is integrating all of this so you can speak to a model that reasons as it searches and produces a canvas that runs Python. All the tools need to work together better. And by the way, all the models need full tool use (o series models can't yet use all tools); that will happen too."

---

> **Q: Will you release attaching files and web search with advanced voice AI?**
>
> **A:** "We launched search with advanced voice in December. Files will come in the future. No ETA yet."

## File & Tool Support

> **Q: Are you planning to add file attachment features to the reasoning models?**
>
> **A:** "Working on it. The reasoning models will be able to use different tools including retrieval in the future. Just to say, I can't wait for reasoning models with tool use. Yes, we are going to!"

---

> **Q: Will we be able to attach files to o3-mini?**
>
> **A:** "We are working on integrating this feature to o-series models!"

# Subscription Tiers & Access

## Plus & Pro Features

> **Q: How far are we from having Operator on the regular Plus plan?**
>
> **A:** "I don't have a date for you but computer use is clearly a part of long-term AGI and we want to bring it to everyone as soon as we can. The initial response has been awesome and we're working on training some specialized models that make operator faster and cheaper, which is the step there. Months."

---

> **Q: What is the limit for o3-mini-high for Plus users?**
>
> **A:** "50 per week, same with o1, and that's separate from the 150 daily limit for o3-mini."

---

> **Q: Why do you think it's still worth it to subscribe to PRO when plus users have a generous amount of o3-mini-high limits?**
>
> **A:** "If you thought o1 pro was sort of worth it, you should think o3 pro will be super worth it. We have o1 pro mode now and operator as well. We will likely continue to have more ways to use more compute for solving hard tasks in the pro tier. And yes, pro users love the no rate limits."

# Future Development & AGI

## AGI Development

> **Q: Let's say it's 2030 and you've just created a system most would call AGI. What now?**
>
> **A:** "The most important impact, in my opinion, will be accelerating the rate of scientific discovery, which I believe is what contributes most to improving quality of life. The interface through which we interact with AI will change pretty fundamentally. Things will be more agentic. AI will continuously work on our behalf, on complex tasks, and on our goals in the background. They will check in with us whenever it is useful. Robotics should also advance enough for them to do useful tasks in the real world for us."

---

> **Q: Do you think recursive self-improvement would be a gradual process or a hard takeoff?**
>
> **A:** "Personally think a fast takeoff is more plausible than I thought a couple of years ago. Probably time to write something about this..."

---

> **Q: Finally the question, which everyone will ask... AGI when?**
>
> **A:** "Yes."

## Robotics & Hardware

> **Q: What are the first objectives for the robotics division?**
>
> **A:** "Robotics: learn! Do a small run of a really good robot and learn from there."

---

> **Q: How is OpenAI seeing the more dedicated chips/TPUs like Trillium, Cerebus and etc?**
>
> **A:** "GB200 hard to beat right now!"

# Business & Development

## Open Source & Transparency

> **Q: Would you consider releasing some model weights and publishing some research?**
>
> **A:** "Yes, we are discussing. I personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open source strategy; not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it's also not our current highest priority."

---

> **Q: Would you ever consider open-sourcing your older models that aren't SOTA anymore?**
>
> **A:** "We'll definitely think about doing more of this."

## API & Pricing

> **Q: When will we see real-time API price cuts?**
>
> **A:** "We just dropped pricing 60% in December! We also released a new 4o-mini that is 10x cheaper too. We think this is pretty reasonable for production usage now. We're always working to make things cheaper though!"

---

> **Q: Will there be API for operator?**
>
> **A:** "What would you use it for?"

## Compliance & Infrastructure

> **Q: Can you make European servers for o3-mini so it's GDPR compliant?**
>
> **A:** "We're testing an EU data residency offering in the API! If you have an account director, reach out to them to learn more. No worries if you don't -- once we are ready for a broad rollout for all, we'll share an announcement and how to sign up."

# Advice & Personal

## Career & Development Advice

> **Q: What's a problem that, if I tackled or made progress on, would make you want to hire me?**
>
> **A:** "New high quality evals are always impressive. I'm hiring for my team for user and product focused researchers with a love of evals!"

---

> **Q: What advice would you give to young startups implementing AI models like yours?**
>
> **A:** "I think the best thing to do is to focus on building a great product for your users and moving as quickly as possible. I think the combo of o3-mini + function calling + structured outputs is a great starting point for most AI startups these days. Once you understand the use case well and want to optimize reasoning token lengths + latency + performance, then look into RFT!"

---

> **Q: If you had to start from scratch with a new career today, what field would you choose?**
>
> **A:** "Find a domain or problem area you are passionate about - for example, it could be improving health, creating more energy for the world etc. The specific technologies to solve them will change over time. AI will also become more important in solving these problems and so learning to use it will be important. Learn to learn - be open and adaptable."

## Personal Questions

> **Q: What do you invest in to hedge against a future with AGI and ASI?**
>
> **A:** "One good thing is your own inner state -- resilience, adaptability, calm, happiness, etc."

---

> **Q: What was your most memorable vacation?**
>
> **A:** "My wife and I ran a 100-mile race up on the India/Nepal border a while back. It was amazing. Tough to pick! But the two that first came to mind: backpacking around Southeast Asia or safari in Africa."
