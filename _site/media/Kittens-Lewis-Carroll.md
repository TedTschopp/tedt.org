Below is one clear way to read the five sentences, followed by the main things they jointly *force* to be true about any hypothetical kitten.  Nothing here depends on real‑world biology—it is pure “if‑this‑then‑that” logic.

---

### 1.  Put every sentence into an “IF … THEN …” form

| Original wording                                               | Equivalent logical rule                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No** kitten **that loves fish** is **unteachable**.          | If a kitten *loves fish* ⇒ it is *teachable*.                   |
| **No** kitten **without a tail** will **play with a gorilla**. | If a kitten *plays with a gorilla* ⇒ it **has** a *tail*.       |
| Kittens **with whiskers** **always** love fish.                | If a kitten *has whiskers* ⇒ it *loves fish*.                   |
| **No** teachable kitten **has green eyes**.                    | If a kitten is *teachable* ⇒ it **does not have** *green eyes*. |
| **No** kittens **have tails unless** they **have whiskers**.   | If a kitten *has a tail* ⇒ it *has whiskers*.                   |

(Each “no … unless …” or “no … that …” turns into a simple if‑then rule.)

### 2.  Chain the rules together

Because each conclusion can trigger the next rule in the table, you get a cascade:

1. **Tail** ⇒ Whiskers
2. Whiskers ⇒ Loves fish
3. Loves fish ⇒ Teachable
4. Teachable ⇒ **Not** green‑eyed

Putting them in one line:

> **Tail ⇒ Whiskers ⇒ Loves fish ⇒ Teachable ⇒ Not green‑eyed**

---

### 3.  Add the “gorilla” condition

Rule 2 says *playing with a gorilla* forces *having a tail*, so slot that at the front:

> **Plays‑with‑gorilla ⇒ Tail ⇒ Whiskers ⇒ Loves fish ⇒ Teachable ⇒ Not green‑eyed**

So any kitten that ever plays with a gorilla must also have **all** of the following: a tail, whiskers, a taste for fish, the ability to be taught, and eyes that are **not** green.

---

### 4.  Work backward from “unteachable” and “green‑eyed”

Because

* Loves fish ⇒ Teachable
  ⇒ (contrapositive) **Unteachable ⇒ Does *not* love fish**

and

* Teachable ⇒ Not green‑eyed
  ⇒ (contrapositive) **Green‑eyed ⇒ Unteachable**

you can keep stepping back through the chain:

* **Unteachable ⇒ No love‑of‑fish ⇒ No whiskers ⇒ No tail ⇒ Will not play‑with‑gorilla**
* **Green‑eyed ⇒ Unteachable ⇒ (same chain as above)**

---

### 5.  Everything the five sentences *together* imply

| If a kitten …        | Then it **must** …                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| plays with a gorilla | have a tail, have whiskers, love fish, be teachable, **not** have green eyes |
| has a tail           | have whiskers, love fish, be teachable, **not** have green eyes              |
| has whiskers         | love fish, be teachable, **not** have green eyes                             |
| loves fish           | be teachable, **not** have green eyes                                        |
| is teachable         | **not** have green eyes                                                      |
| is unteachable       | not love fish, not have whiskers, not have a tail, not play with a gorilla   |
| has green eyes       | be unteachable (and therefore share every “unteachable” restriction above)   |

There are **no contradictions** among the rules; they simply carve the universe of “kittens” into two broad camps:

* **Whisker/Tail/Fish‑loving/Teachable/Not‑green‑eyed** kittens (possibly gorilla‑playful), and
* **Green‑eyed/Unteachable/No‑tail/No‑whisker/No‑fish‑love** kittens (definitely not gorilla‑playful).

That logical structure—and nothing about real cats—is exactly “what it means.”
