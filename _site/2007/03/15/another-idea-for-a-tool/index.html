<p>I want a tool that allows me to import into the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Bookmarks</li>
  <li>Browser Favorites / Bookmarks</li>
  <li>Del.icio.us</li>
</ul>

<p>The Applicaiton should take as an input:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RSS</li>
  <li>OMPL</li>
</ul>

<p>The above files should use extensions to handle categories or tags.</p>

<p>What I’m going to build here is a tool that will sync up a list of postings.  I currently have things in my RSS reader, my Google Bookmakrs, my browser favorites, and my Del.icio.us links.</p>

<p>I guess the idea here is that RSS / RDF / OMPL RSS and OMPL are really good transports for the metadata assoicated with a given webpage.  We should be able to get information in and out of each of tools that are used to create these links.</p>
