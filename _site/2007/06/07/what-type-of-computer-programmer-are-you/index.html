<hr />

<p>Your programmer personality type is:</p>

<p>   <strong><span style="font-size:1.4em;">PHTB</span></strong><br />
**<br />
You’re a <span style="font-size:1.4em;">P</span>lanner.**<br />
You may be slow, but you’ll usually find the best solution. If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right.<br />
<strong>You like coding at a <span style="font-size:1.4em;">H</span>igh level.</strong><br />
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.<br />
<strong>You work best in a <span style="font-size:1.4em;">T</span>eam.</strong><br />
A good group is better than the sum of it’s parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.<br />
<strong>You are a li<span style="font-size:1.4em;">B</span>eral programmer.</strong><br />
Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We’re not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.</p>
