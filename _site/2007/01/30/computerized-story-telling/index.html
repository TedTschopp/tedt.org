<p>I found an article today on <a href="http://digg.com/software/Forget_1000_monkeys_could_a_PC_write_Shakespeare">Digg</a> about computers writing stories.  While I do think this is possible, I have yet to hear anyone getting close.  <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/mp3page.htm">Music</a> has been done, and done so well that it’s causing people in to rethink what creativity means.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is being posted so I don’t have to hunt down the paper again, and I can read it when I have time to think about it.</p>
