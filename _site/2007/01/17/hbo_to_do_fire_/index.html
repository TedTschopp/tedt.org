<p>Did you hear that?  That was the sound of a million geeks falling over dead with pleasure comas.</p>

<p>Here is the information about <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=39447">Diamond Age and Cloony</a>, and here is the information about <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957532.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">Fire and Ice</a>.</p>

<p>I personally feel that its final proof the world is going to end soon as there is some holy and devout geek out there who has been praying “God please don’t destroy the human race until _<strong>_</strong>__ has been made into a movie.”  Of course that blank would be, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Fire and Ice, and Diamond Age.</p>

<p>For all of you who have not read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553588486/">George R. R. Martin</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Age-Illustrated-Primer-Spectra/dp/0553380966/">Neal Stephenson</a>, you are missing out on some of the best fiction written in the last 20 years.  Just a word of caution, both books are rated a strong R if they were to be movies.</p>
