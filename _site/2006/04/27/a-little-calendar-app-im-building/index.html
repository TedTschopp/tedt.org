<p>Ok, more stuff to post on my calendar <a href="http://www.tschopp.net/ted/2006/04/a_little_calend.html">App</a>.  I’ve gotten the ical file loaded into the webpage, now I need to convert the ical file into a usable data type.  My current thoughts are to go from i-Cal -&gt; XML.  I need to spend some time looking at the practices of converting from i-Cal -&gt; XML.  I notice that Google is doing it.  Also the Microformat guys seem to be doing it as well.</p>
