<p>Slowly slip the sands of time<br />
Past my fingers, through my hands.<br />
Crashing waves and pounding surf<br />
Tonightâ€™s the night we leave this earth</p>

<p>Companions brave our task complete.<br />
Some come to live, some come to sleep.<br />
But on my knees I come today <br />
Forgiveness asked and penance paid.</p>

<p>As we depart this earthly sphere<br />
I search myself for pride and fear:<br />
A sadness now, a twinge of guilt<br />
As glories fade and triumphs wilt.</p>

<p>Straight is our path into the west<br />
Straight is our journey and our quest<br />
The course is set, our way secure:<br />
Old burdens heavy, old hearts now pure.</p>

<p>Slowly slip the sands of time<br />
Past my fingers, through my hands.<br />
A whispering breeze, a swan in flight,<br />
A world awaking, an end to night.</p>
