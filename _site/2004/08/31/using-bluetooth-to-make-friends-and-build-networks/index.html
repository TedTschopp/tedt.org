<p>Serendipity is being developed by Nathan Eagle, 27, a graduate student in media technology at MIT. It uses Bluetooth wireless technology to connect like-minded souls.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every device loaded with Bluetooth – be it a cellphone, a laptop or a PDA – broadcasts a unique ID via a radio frequency that alerts every other Bluetooth device within 5 to 10 meters of its existence. Eagle’s software, also installed in the device, wakes up every 60 seconds and grabs any new IDs in sight. It sends those IDs to Eagle’s server (at <a href="http://www.mobule.com/">www.mobule.com</a>), where interested parties have banked personal profiles.</p>

<p>It’s almost at the point where software could be written for a network like this.</p>
