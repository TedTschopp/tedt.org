## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `_code/` - Custom Python scripts for content management.
- `_data/` - Structured data used across the site.
- `_includes/` - Reusable HTML components for the site (see [Include Standards](#include-standards) below).
- `_layouts/` - Templates for different types of pages.
- `_posts/` - Blog posts written in Markdown.
- `_sass/` - SCSS files for styling the site.
- `_site/` - Generated by Jekyll during the build process. This folder contains the compiled version of the site and should not be edited directly.
- `_work-in-progress/` - Contains drafts or incomplete work for future updates.
- `css/` - Custom styles for the site.
- `js/` - JavaScript files for interactivity.

> [!NOTE]
> The `_site/` folder is generated by Jekyll and should not be edited directly.

## Include Standards

The `_includes/` directory follows a structured organizational system for better maintainability and development experience. All include files are organized into logical subdirectories with consistent naming conventions.

### Directory Structure

```text
_includes/
├── analytics/          # Analytics and tracking scripts
├── assets/             # CSS, JS, and dependency management  
├── content/            # Content display and navigation
├── feeds/              # RSS and data feeds
├── gaming/             # RPG and gaming-specific functionality
├── layout/             # Core page structure and layout
├── personal/           # Personal branding and identity
├── pwa/                # Progressive Web App features
├── seo/                # SEO, metadata, and social cards
├── social/             # Social media integration
├── themes/             # Reusable template components
└── utility/            # Helper functions and utilities
```

### Directory Purposes

| Directory | Purpose | Example Files |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `analytics/` | Third-party tracking and analytics | Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Clarity |
| `assets/` | CSS, JS dependencies, and asset loading | Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome |
| `content/` | Content display, navigation, formatting | Figure displays, post previews, progress bars |
| `feeds/` | RSS, JSON feeds, syndication | RSS feeds, JSON feeds |
| `gaming/` | RPG and gaming-specific functionality | Creature displays, game mechanics |
| `layout/` | Core page structure and layout | Header, footer, navigation |
| `personal/` | Personal branding and identity | H-card, resume, contact info |
| `pwa/` | Progressive Web App features | PWA headers, service workers |
| `seo/` | SEO, metadata, social cards | Meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards |
| `social/` | Social media integration | Comments, webmentions, sharing |
| `themes/` | Reusable template components | Post grids, pagination, navigation |
| `utility/` | Helper functions and tools | Date formatting, text processing |

### Naming Conventions

All include files follow **kebab-case** naming conventions:

- ✅ `post-preview.html`
- ✅ `next-and-previous.html`  
- ✅ `category-emoji.html`
- ❌ `post_preview.html`
- ❌ `nextAndPrevious.html`
- ❌ `CategoryEmoji.html`

### Usage Examples

When including files in layouts or posts, use the full path:

```liquid
<!-- Layout components -->
{% include layout/header.html %}
{% include layout/footer.html %}

<!-- Content components -->
{% include content/figure.html %}
{% include content/post-preview.html %}

<!-- Utility functions -->
{% include utility/category-emoji.html category="Technology" %}
{% include utility/fuzzy-date.html %}

<!-- SEO and metadata -->
{% include seo/meta-data-seo.html %}
{% include seo/twitter-card-metadata.html %}
```

### Adding New Includes

When adding new include files:

1. **Choose the appropriate directory** based on functionality
2. **Use kebab-case naming** for the filename
3. **Add documentation** to describe the include's purpose
4. **Update references** in layouts and posts as needed

### Migration from Old Structure

The include system was refactored in July 2025 to improve organization. Old flat-structure references have been updated, but if you encounter any old-style includes like `{% include filename.html %}`, they should be updated to use the new directory structure.

For a complete mapping of old to new paths, see the `includes-path-mapping.md` file in the project root.

### Quick Reference

**Most commonly used includes:**

```liquid
<!-- Page structure -->
{% include layout/header.html %}
{% include layout/footer.html %}
{% include layout/top-nav-bar.html %}

<!-- Assets -->
{% include assets/all-css-includes.html %}
{% include assets/js-bottom-of-body.html %}

<!-- SEO -->
{% include seo/meta-data-seo.html %}
{% include seo/indieauth-webmentions-metadata.html %}

<!-- Content -->
{% include content/figure.html %}
{% include content/progress-bar.html %}
{% include content/next-and-previous.html %}

<!-- Utilities -->
{% include utility/category-emoji.html category="Technology" %}
{% include utility/calculate-variables.html %}
```
