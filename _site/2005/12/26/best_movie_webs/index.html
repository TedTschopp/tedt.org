<p>I ran into <a href="http://doublefeaturefinder.com/" target="_blank">this</a> page on <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>. Iâ€™m definitly going to remember where it is for my next long Saturday / Sunday when I have no plans. The site allows individuals to plan double features. The interface can use a bit of work, but definitly worth remembering.</p>
