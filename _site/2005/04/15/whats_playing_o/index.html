<p>Ever wonder what’s playing on KROQ?  Well, here is your chance to get an XML feed that has it all.</p>

<p><a href="http://tmex.spun.com/tmexhistory.jsp?CampaignID=1253273&amp;Events=10&amp;EndTime=20050415-0930">http://tmex.spun.com/tmexhistory.jsp?CampaignID=1253273&amp;Events=10&amp;EndTime=20050415-0930</a></p>

<p>Now to write an XSLT to parse it and link to the iTunes and Amazon.com stores (oh and why not the SPUN store as well).</p>

<p>You will need to modify the EndTime= variable in the URL to match the following: YYYYMMDD-HHMM So April 1, 2008 at 9:30am would be EndTime=20080401-0930</p>
