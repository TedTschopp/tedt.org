<p>The following are my notes and the attempt to put together my thoughts on Mutations in Gamma World and evolving it into D&amp;D 5e. A lot of work is needed here, but I thought I’d release it.</p>

<h2 id="mutations-in-gamma-world">Mutations in Gamma World</h2>

<p>During the days of Tech Level VI, a lot of time was spent by Artificial Intelligences and bioengineers to come up with ways to modify humans, animals, and plants.  During this time all sort of transhumanism and animal / plant uplifting took place.  After the cataclysm many of these strains granted their species advantages in survival.   The following attempts to recreate the understanding these people had and make sense of this information.</p>

<p>The first piece of information that is important to note is that all of this genetic modification was accomplished through various technologies, but each of them were powered by various kinds of radiation.  They also attempted to harness these ambient energies from the world and use them to enhance the human experience.</p>

<p>Mutations can be classified into various sorts based on this science.  The first is cosmetic.  The next sort of mutations mankind focused on was enhancements of various sorts.  They focused on enhancing the human experience through the adding and enhancing our senses.  However they also looked at enhancing the quality of life for their fellow man by enhancing their strength, health, and intelligence.</p>

<p>Finally mankind started to look into the mind to enhance our abilities into those only found myth, legend, and fantastical fictions.  Soon the ability to modify the physical world with mere thought was well within the grasp of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Once man had studied himself and made himself a god.  He looked at making the animals and the plants in his own image.  These mutations were made to turn animals and plants into humanoid creatures that man could interact with and build a community together with.</p>

<h3 id="radiation-and-its-many-forms">Radiation and its many forms</h3>

<p>As was stated earlier, radiation is the most important element of the formula to modify the genetic materials.  In the formal definition, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. There are four basic forms of radiation.</p>

<h4 id="electromagnetic-radiation">Electromagnetic Radiation</h4>

<p>Electromagnetic radiation refers to the waves of the electromagnetic field, propagating and thus radiating through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy.  This sort of radiation is radio waves, microwaves, visible light, x-rays, and gamma radiation.  Weapons created using this form of radiation are your standard forms or lasers.</p>

<p>{Insert Table of types of Radiation}</p>

<h4 id="particle-radiation">Particle Radiation</h4>

<p>Particle radiation is the radiation of energy by means of fast-moving subatomic particles this is referred to as a particle beam if the particles are all moving in the same direction.  This is your traditional science fiction blaster uses this sort of radiation.  Also many large facilities use particle radiation as a form of power.</p>

<h4 id="acoustic-radiation">Acoustic Radiation</h4>

<p>Acoustics is the radiation that occurs when mechanical vibration generates a wave through gases, liquids, and solids.  This sort of radiation is experienced through all forms of vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.</p>

<p>{Insert Table of types of Radiation}</p>

<h4 id="gravitational-radiation">Gravitational Radiation</h4>

<p>Gravitational radiation is the form of radiation that creates the ripples and curvatures in spacetime.  This form of radiation is important for travel within the solar system and was the state of the art in study at the time of the cataclysm as mastery of this form of radiation would be needed for interstellar travel.</p>

<h3 id="genetic-stability">Genetic stability</h3>

<p>The genetic stability of a character is a new stat that measures how much genetic change this mutant can take before the biological systems that make them up break down.  This translates into the number of mutations that the mutant has.  During the lifetime of a mutant this number may increase as the character purges themselves of mutations or as the character receives mutations that increase their stability.  This stat is used to balance out various character types and ensure that a player doesn’t end up with a character that is out of balance with other characters they encounter.  A group of 4 player characters with a genetic stability of 2 each going up against a Chimeric monstrosity with a genetic stability of 12 will be quite inappropriate.</p>

<h4 id="genetic-drift">Genetic drift</h4>

<p>If a player has free genetic stability points to spend, they need to take into account that they are now genetically adrift.  This means that as they encounter mutagens and radiation in Gamma</p>

<h3 id="types-of-genetic-modifications">Types of Genetic Modifications</h3>

<h4 id="cosmetic">Cosmetic</h4>

<p>These mutations are those that modify the appearance of the mutant without modifying the stats of the mutant.  At Tech Level VI it was common to change hair and skin color and length.  This sort of mutation is free to the player as long as it doesn’t affect the overall stats of the character.  It is also expected that a mutant PC will have taken these modifications to blend into their home’s habitats.  During the Tech Level VI days, this would have been modification for the sake of fancy or preference.  In this example, the PC might choose to have long purple hair with orange tiger stripes and black hands.  Anything was possible during that era.  However a Tech Level I humanoid rat that lives in the mutant dandelion fields will have cosmetic changes to fur that color it dark green with streaks or white, black, and grey in order to survive in that territory. These cosmetic changes and adaptations are caused by the basic application of Darwin’s law.</p>

<h4 id="size">Size</h4>

<p>During the final years before the cataclysm genetic modification to a species size in predictable ways.  Some humans wanted to be smaller, and others wanted to be bigger.  This also means that the size of the animal was modified to human proportions.  It costs one mutation for each size change you wish to perform. The size table is reproduced below.</p>

<p>Let’s do an example: I am going to create a Woolly Mammoth Mutant Animal.  The first step is to get their Stats from the D&amp;D 5e SRD.</p>

<p>The University is a Service Ideology with a University as its headquarters.  It builds satellite facilities as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Level 5:</strong> The University itself is a tech level 4 facility today that was once a Tech Level 6 facility that has an huge underground AI Think Tank.</p>

<p><strong>Level 4:</strong> The Library.  The University has a library at The University itself, but it also has several satellite libraries that it operates in various capital cities around the continent.  These facilities are tech level 3 facilities with printing presses and imported radio transmitters it uses to communicate with the University itself.</p>

<p><strong>Level 3:</strong> The College.  The University operates schools across the continent.  These school are tech level 3 facilities that operate in various many cities.  The focus of these facilities is to train people in the Trivium and to funnel exceptional students to the University so they can further their goals of restoring the lost knowledge of the Ancients.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2:</strong> The Laboratory.  The University operates various field laboratories around the continent.  These labs can be everything from Tech Level 3 all the way up to the Tech Level of the surrounding “culture”.  Many times the University will deploy a lab in the Ancient ruins in order to retrieve some esoteric piece of missing data, or to retrieve an artifact.  These facilities are temporary.  Permanent Laboratories are deployed at The Colleges and at the Libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1:</strong> The Chapter House.  The University operates small safe houses around the continent in various tech level 1 and 2 cities and towns.  These chapter houses are staffed with a single family unit without children and operate as safe places and an underground railroad for people escaping anti-technology / anti-learning ideologies. These buildings match the tech level of their surroundings and have a hidden communications relay station that allows The University to maintain an extensive communications network that ties directly into the Think Tank.</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><strong>Mammoth</strong></p>

  <p>Size: Huge</p>

  <p>Armor Class: 13</p>

  <p>Hit Points: 126 (11D12 + 55)</p>

  <p>Speed: 40 feet</p>

  <p>Strength: 24</p>

  <p>Dex: 9</p>

  <p>Con: 21</p>

  <p>Int: 3</p>

  <p>Wis: 11</p>

  <p>Cha: 6</p>

  <p>Actions:</p>

  <p><em>Trampling Charge.</em>If the mammoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the mammoth can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action. Armor Class would drop by 3</p>

  <p><em>Gore.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) piercing damage.</p>

  <p><em>Stomp.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.</p>
</div>

<p>Now I am going to say I want this guy to be Human in size so I need to move him down two sizes.  The first size will drop his strength by 5 and his dexterity will be unchanged and his Constitution will drop 3.  His Hit Dice will also drop to D10s.  This is for the first round of genetic modification. So to Summarize:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><strong>Mammoth</strong></p>

  <p>Size: Large</p>

  <p>Armor Class: 13 - 2 = 11</p>

  <p>Hit Points: ??? (??D10 + ??)</p>

  <p>Speed: 40 feet</p>

  <p>Strength: 24 - 5 = 19 (+4 Modifier)</p>

  <p>Dex: 9 = 9</p>

  <p>Con: 21 - 3 = 18</p>

  <p>Int: 3</p>

  <p>Wis: 11</p>

  <p>Cha: 6</p>
</div>

<p>Our Mammoth is now the size of a Troll or Giant, but you need to get smaller.  This means your size will drop to Normal.  Your Strength will drop by 4, your Dexterity will increase by 2, and your Constitution will drop by 2. And finally your hit dice will drop to D8s.  Our Armor Class will be modified down 2 more.  This is our final stats:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><strong>Mammoth</strong></p>

  <p>Size: Medium</p>

  <p>Armor Class: 11 - 1 = 10 (+ 0 Dex Modifier)</p>

  <p>Hit Points: ??? (??D8 + ??)</p>

  <p>Speed: 40 feet</p>

  <p>Strength: 24 - 5 = 19 - 4 = 15 (+2 modifier)</p>

  <p>Dex: 9 = 9 + 2 = 11 (+0 modifier)</p>

  <p>Con: 21 - 3 = 18 - 2 = 16  (+3 modifier)</p>

  <p>Int: 3 (-4 Modifier)</p>

  <p>Wis: 11 (+0 modifier)</p>

  <p>Cha: 6 (-2 Modifier)</p>
</div>

<p>Now our character is level 1, so his hit points are 11 (1D8 + 3)</p>

<p>For animals that were modified in size, their base attacks also changed.  Below is a table to help create attacks scaled up or down to the appropriate size.  A couple notes: Most creatures will have primary and secondary attacks.  This table below is for the average secondary attack.  A primary attack will have one more die.  For example a Large Horse will have a primary attack of Hoof of 1d8, but because this is the horse’s primary attack, this will be a 2d8 attack.  If this horse is then shrunk to the size of the world’s smallest horse Size Tiny, the horse would have a primary attack of Hoof 2d4.  Another consideration is if the creature in question is a Alpha or legendary (this rule is not for PCs) then increase the size of the dice.  So with our horse example, The world’s smallest horse is the alpha in a team with a dozen other tiny horses.  Then the hoof damage would be 2d6 for our little guy.  Truly a legend!</p>

<p>For our above example of our Wooly Mammoth let’s look at the actions:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><em>Trampling Charge.</em>If the mammoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the mammoth can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action. Armor Class would drop by 3</p>

  <p><em>Gore.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) piercing damage.</p>

  <p><em>Stomp.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.</p>
</div>

<p>When we go from Huge to Large the attacks would change as follows:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><em>Gore.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.</p>

  <p><em>Stomp.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</p>
</div>

<p>When we go from Large to Medium the attacks would change as follows:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><em>Gore.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.</p>

  <p><em>Stomp.</em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>
</div>
<p>This means that our Wooly Mammoth has the following mutation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decreased Size (2)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ability-score-mutations">Ability Score Mutations</h4>

<p>The method to build your character’s ability scores is based on the D&amp;D 5e ability score of the standard array but takes into account that not everyone has a human baseline.  So your standard array is (+5, +4, +3, +2, +0, -2).  But you also need to account for mutations, and potential future mutations.  So each ability score enhancement gives you a free “Enhanced {Ability Score} mutation”.  And for the one ability score at -2 you get a free “Decreased {Ability Score} Mutation”.  These mutations will be used later during character creation and adventuring<br />
Example: Our Wooly Mammoth from above now has the following stats:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p><strong>Mammoth</strong></p>

  <p>Size: Medium</p>

  <p>Armor Class: 11 - 1 = 10 (+ 0 Dex Modifier)</p>

  <p>Hit Points: 11 (1D8 + 3)</p>

  <p>Dex: 11 (+0 modifier)</p>

  <p>Con: 16  (+3 modifier)</p>

  <p>Int: 3 (-4 Modifier)</p>

  <p>Wis: 11 (+0 modifier)</p>

  <p>Mutations:</p>

  <p>Decreased Size (2)</p>
</div>

<p>I want to modify him as follows:</p>

<div class="example well">
  <p>Strength = 15 + 0 = 15 (+2)</p>

  <p>Dexterity = 11 + 3 = 14 (+2)</p>

  <p>Constitution -2 = 16 - 2 = 14 (+2)</p>

  <p>Intelligence = 3 + 5 = 8 (-1)</p>

  <p>Wisdom =  11 + 2 = 13 (+1)</p>

  <p>Charisma = 6 + 4  = 10 (0)</p>

  <p>This gives him the following mutations:</p>

  <p>Enhanced Dexterity (+3)</p>

  <p>Decreased Constitution (-2)</p>

  <p>Enhanced Intelligence (+5)</p>

  <p>Enhanced Wisdom (+2)</p>

  <p>Enhanced Charisma (+4)</p>

<p>So finally My Wooly Mammoth has the following stats:</p>

<div class="example well">

<h4 id="mutant-animals">Mutant Animals</h4>

<p>Animals during the final days were enhanced using several templates.  Below are the levels of this modification.</p>

<p>{Insert Rules to pass for Animals by humans and AIs} - (Arms + Legs + Voice) - Torso * -1 = Modifier to recognize as animal</p>

<p>{Insert Rules to pass for Humans by humans and AIs} Arms + Legs + Voice + Torso  = Modifier to recognize as human.</p>

<h5 id="arms">Arms</h5>

<p>It was common to make animals have human arms and hands.  There were several levels this sort of modification took place.  Animals such as birds and fish will not have arms or hands to begin with, they will need to spend an additional slot to get to this mutation. So a fish with arms and hands with fingers and no opposable thumbs would be a level 1 mutation costing 2 slots. A fish with humanoid hands would be a level 2 mutation costing 3 slots.</p>

<p><strong>Level 0 - No modification.</strong> This means the mutant can not use tools unless they specifically are from a base animal like a racoon, ape, or a cephalopod that has the ability to use tools. This will mean that most skills or the use of tools or weapons will not be possible for the mutant, and their tech level will be 0.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1 - Slight Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now has a fingers or tentacles. The mutant still has no opposable thumb.  Certain animals will get this level of mutation for free  (Raccoons, Cats, Dogs, and Cephalopods) as they have non-opposable thumbs to begin with.  A Mutant Cat will still have their digits modified, but due to cats having non-opposable thumbs they get this mutation for free.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2 - Complete Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now has fingers or tentacles, an opposable thumb, and human like palms.  Certain animals will get this level of mutation for free (Apes, Monkeys, Panda, Opossum, Koala, Frog)</p>

<h5 id="legs">Legs</h5>

<p>IT was common to make animals have human feet and legs.  There were several levels this sort of modification took place. Animals such as a snake will not have legs to begin with, they will need to spend an additional slot to get to this mutation. So a snake legs, allowing it to rear up on its legs would be a level 1 mutation costing 2 slots. A snake with with humanoid legs able to run like a human a level 2 mutation costing 3 slots.  In the case of this snake it would make sense to allow the snake to have multiple legs as well without the cost of having an additional body parts mutation.</p>

<p><strong>Level 0 - No modification.</strong> This means the mutant can not stand upright without mechanical or technical support such as a stick.  This also means that they can only move at the speed of a crawl while upright.  In order to walk they need to drop the stick and return to their non-upright position.  This means that the animal will not be able to use fighting skills or weapons.  They will need to rely on their natural forms of attack, such as bite and claws.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1 - Slight Modification.</strong>. This means that the animal now the ability to stand upright and fight in place.  They will have the ability to walk upright but they will have a hard time running, jumping, kicking, or turning around without returning to all fours.  Certain animals will get this level of mutation for free  (Bears, rats, mice, and lizards) as they have some upright mobility to begin with.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2 - Complete Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now has no problems moving, walking, running in an upright position.  They are essentially human.  Certain animals will get this level of mutation for free (Apes, Monkeys, Kangaroos, and all birds).</p>

<h5 id="voice-box">Voice Box</h5>

<p>An important aspect of interaction between intelligent species is their ability to communicate vocally.  These mutations are focused on changes to a creature’s ability to communicate.  It should be noted that all uplifted PC animals understand human speech, not all of them can speak it.  However, this is not true for NPC animals.  They might not understand human speech at all, and they will need to pick that up separately.</p>

<p><strong>Level 0 - No modification.</strong> This means the mutant has no way of producing sound or does not have any vocal cords. A PC may only choose this option only if they have some other way to communicate such a metal mutations that give telepathy or through writing or sign language.  In the case of each of these, they would need to have the right level of mutations in those areas.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1 - Slight Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now the ability to communicate like a parrot of small human child or via a 1980’s text to voice system.  This means that the animals communications are understood by people who spend a couple weeks interacting with them, but outsiders will have to concentrate to understand their voice.  All mammals, birds, and many insects that make noises such as crickets and cicadas have this level of the mutation for free. This means you have a base intelligence of 5.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2 - Complete Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now has vocal cords that are equivalent to humans.  This means that the character has the ability to do anything a human can with their voice such as sing and mimic other sounds.  They are essentially human from a vocal perspective.  No animals get this mutation for free.  This means you have a base intelligence of 7.</p>

<h5 id="appearance">Appearance</h5>

<p>During the final years before the cataclysm genetic modification became so predictable that it was able to transform animals into humanoid.  This transformation modified their body and their face to make them appear very human. .</p>

<p><strong>Level 0 - No modification.</strong> This means the mutant has no changes to its appearance or facial features.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1 - Slight Modification.</strong>. This means that the animal might pass for human by another human in dark or confused settings.  Their animalistic characteristics are reduced such as the fur of a bear, or the trunk and ears of an elephant.  If anyone or anything gets a time to study the creature, they will assume the animal is a half human half animal mix.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2 - Complete Modification.</strong>  This means that the animal now can pass for a mutant human.  They will have hair, eyes, teeth, and other features in normal human proportions.  So a mutant elephant will appear as a mutant with a broad shoulders, large nose, large upper teeth slightly protruding past their lips, and large ears.  An insect will appear as a diminutive woman with shapely curves, large eyes, and smooth skin.</p>

<h4 id="mutant-plants">Mutant Plants</h4>

<p>Humanoid plants were common before the Apocalypse.  In most cases these plants were not modified past to the extent that animals were modified.  Plants follow the same basic principle as animals, however, none of the plants modified have anything like animalistic patterns to follow, so each genetic modification costs one additional mutation slot for each mutation they pick. So in order to get to level 2, they will need to spend 3 slots.</p>

<h4 id="consumption-mutations">Consumption Mutations</h4>

<p>All Consumption Mutations are based on taking various forms of radiation and converting them into energy.  The most common form of this mutation is the plant’s ability to take visible light and convert it energy.  At level 0 this mutation will take 8 hours of radiation and convert it into 24 hours of energy for the mutant.  At level 1 this mutation will take 4 hours of radiation and convert it into 24 hours of energy for the mutant.  At level 2 this mutation will take 1 hour of radiation and convert it into 24 hours of energy for the mutant.  All of these mutations do not grant the mutant immunity to that form of radiation.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Visual Radiation:</strong> This is a more general form of photosynthesis.  Plants in general consume red and blue light and reflect green light (thus their color).  This mutation is a more general form of this this ability.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Infrared Radiation / Heat Transfer:</strong> This is a mutation to consume heat and turn that into nutrition.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Ultraviolet light:</strong> This mutation allows the mutant to consume ultraviolet light as food. Mutants with this mutation will have very view skin blemishes.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Broadcast Power:</strong> This mutation allows the mutant to consume broadcast power as food.  Broadcast power uses beams that track the recipient.  The mutant must remain in the beam for the duration to consume the energy.  This is essentially the ability most robots use to recharge their batteries.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Radio Waves:</strong> This mutation allows the mutant the ability to gain energy from radio waves.  Radio waves are generally not directed communications and are broadcast forms of radiation.  There is no specific place, other than within the range of the broadcast tower.  The closer the mutant is to the tower the less time the mutant needs to take to avoid eating.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Force Fields:</strong> This mutation allows the mutant the ability to consume the energy that is found within a force field.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Magnetic Energy:</strong> This mutant can consume magnetic energy.  They must remain within the magnetic field while they are doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Consume Radar / Sound:</strong> The mutant is consume extremely loud sounds as energy.</p>

<h4 id="reflection-mutations">Reflection Mutations</h4>

<p>All Reflection Mutations are based on taking various forms of radiation and reflecting it back away from the mutant in a controlled manner.  There are two levels of this mutation.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1:</strong>  Some damage directed at the mutant will be reflected away from the defender in a controlled manner.  Once the defender is hit and the attacker rolls damage, the defender will roll damage using the same dice as the attacker.  Before the defender takes damage, the defender will get to direct 50% of the damage the mutant rolled to a target of the mutant’s choice.  After this attack, and any potential triggered attacks have been resolved the mutant will then take damage normally.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2:</strong>  Some damage directed at the mutant will be reflected away from the defender in a controlled manner.  Once the defender is hit and the attacker rolls damage, the defender will roll damage using the same dice as the attacker.  Before the defender takes damage, the defender will get to direct 100% of the damage the mutant rolled or 100% of the damage the attacker is doing to him, whichever is higher, to a target of the mutant’s choice.  After this attack, and any potential triggered attacks have been resolved the mutant will then take damage normally.</p>

<h4 id="projection-mutations">Projection Mutations</h4>

<h4 id="vulnerability-and-resistance-mutations">Vulnerability and Resistance Mutations</h4>

<p>From the D&amp;D 5e SRD</p>

<p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>

<p>If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>

<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all non-magical damage, the damage of a non-magical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>

<p>Each form of radiation is a different form of Vulnerability and Resistance.  Level one (and negative one) of this mutation is described above.  Level two (and negative two) stacks as follows:</p>

<p>If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved<strong>_ and halved again <em>**against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled**</em> and doubled again _</strong>against it.</p>

<h4 id="senses">Senses</h4>

<p>Senses in the traditionally are experienced as certain chemical reactions happened inside an organ within the body of the creature experiencing the stimuli. As humans started to modify themselves many experiments were done and a lot of lessons were learned.  The basic thought was to map certain forms of radiation to the different senses that make the most sense.</p>

<p>In the final days before the end of the world, mankind and their AI partners had evolved senses along several dimensions. A mutation can have 5 different levels along this dimension ranging from -2 up through 0 and up to +2.  Zero represents human norm, and each level above and below represents adjustments made to perception checks when this sort of sense is used to perceive something.</p>

<p><strong>Perception to Blindness</strong> - the first dimension of evolution that mankind looked at was the ability to enhance the ability to perceive new senses.</p>

<p><strong>Microscopic to Telescopic</strong> - Another dimension of evolution that mankind has addressed for centuries is the ability to sense the very far or the very close.  Each level is an order of magnitude (10x) beyond human normal with all negative numbers are microscopic levels and all positive levels are telescopic levels.</p>

<p><strong>Types of senses</strong></p>

<h5 id="sight">Sight</h5>

<p>All types of sight listed below are generally explained best by the analogy of a visual inert or overlay. All Touch sensory mutations give the mutant +2 per level to perception rolls where that sense would benefit the player.  Each sight sense can also be further enhanced by adding Microscopic to Telescopic versions of this sense.  From a robotic perspective this just adds the prefix to the type of Microscopic or Telescopic to that sense.</p>

<p><strong>Visual:</strong> Human visual senses allow the ability to see at human ranges. Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type H subtype V or Hv.  Cannot be used if blindfolded.</p>

<p><strong>Infrared:</strong> Infrared senses allow someone the ability to see into the infrared spectrum.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type IR.  Cannot be used if blindfolded.</p>

<p><strong>Ultraviolet:</strong> Ultraviolet senses allow someone the ability to see into the ultraviolet spectrum.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type UV. Cannot be used if blindfolded.</p>

<p><strong>Broadcast Power:</strong> Broadcast senses allow someone to sense the source of a broadcast power base. You are also able to detect power in wires and electronics as well.  At different levels of perception they will also be able to ascertain the correct frequency of the broadcast power automatically when they are within broadcast range.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type B.  This sense is picked up by new organs and fed to the visual cortex of the mutant.  If this mutant is blindfolded over their eyes, they may still use this sense.</p>

<p><strong>Communications, Radio Waves:</strong> Communications, Radio Waves senses allow someone to pick up transmissions from communicators, radios, homing beacons and other devices that use radio waves or similar alternate methods to communicate over distances. A mutant who has this ability can see the radio waves and the communications channels but can not understand what is being communicated on those channels.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type C subtype V or Cv.  Robots will also generally not be able to understand the communications they receive on these channels unless they also have sufficient programming to decrypt any encrypted communication.   They will be able to understand unencrypted communications only if they have sufficient INT.  This sense is picked up by new organs and fed to the visual cortex of the mutant.  If this mutant is blindfolded over their eyes, they may still use this sense.</p>

<p><strong>Electromagnetic Senses:</strong> Electromagnetic senses allow someone to detect force fields in use.  This sense also allows someone the the ability to detect the electromagnetic lines of force around the world, thus they never will never be lost and will always know where it is in relationship to its home base.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type EM subtype V or EMv.  This sense is picked up by new organs and fed to the visual cortex of the mutant.  If this mutant is blindfolded over their eyes, they may still use this sense.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic:</strong> Magnetic senses allow someone the ability to detect any mass of ferrous metal, and to recognize the object if the sensing person has seen it before.  They would also be able to detect if the ferrous object had any flaws.   Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type M subtype V or Mv.  This sense is picked up by new organs and fed to the visual cortex of the mutant.  If this mutant is blindfolded over their eyes, they may still use this sense.</p>

<p><strong>Radar:</strong> Radar / Sonar senses allow someone the equivalency of the Sonar physical mutation.  This is a form of Acoustic radiation sensing.  There is both a sense of touch and a sense of sight associated with Radar / Sonar.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type R subtype V or Rv.  This sense is picked up by new organs and fed to the visual cortex of the mutant.  If this mutant is blindfolded over their eyes, they may still use this sense.</p>

<h5 id="touch">Touch</h5>

<p>These senses are picked up by the skin and fed into the brain as various forms of pressure and temperature on the body.  It should be noted that any of these senses can be overloaded in environments with a lot of stimuli.  All Touch sensory mutations give the mutant +1 per level to perception rolls where that sense would benefit the player.  This sense senses the radiation where the mutant or robot is located, and there is no form or modification in regards to Microscopic or Telescopic.</p>

<p><strong>Touch:</strong> Feeling sense allow someone the human senses of touch.  The heightened the sense of touch is the same as Body Control (touch) physical mutation.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type F subtype T or Ft.</p>

<p><strong>Auditory:</strong> Human auditory senses allow someone the ability to hear at human ranges through the sense of touch.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type H subtype AT  or Hat.</p>

<p><strong>Radar:</strong> Radar / Sonar senses allow someone to feel sound waves on their skin allowing them to understand the area they are in without sight.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type R subtype T  or Rt.</p>

<p><strong>Vibrational:</strong>. Vibrational senses allow someone the ability feel motion.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type V subtype T  or Vt.</p>

<p><strong>Gravitational Senses / Type G:</strong> Gravitational senses allow someone to detect gravitational lines of force.  This sense is not very handy on the face of a large planet like earth, but was a common mutation available to orbital pilots as it allowed them the ability to detect the gravitational  lines of force in zero gravity, and thus they never will never be lost and will always know where they are.  Additionally it made complex environments like the asteroid belts easier to navigate.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type G subtype T or Gt.</p>

<h5 id="smell">Smell</h5>

<p>These senses are picked up by the skin and fed into the brain as various forms of smell in the nose.  It should be noted that any of these senses can be overloaded in environments with a lot of stimuli.  All smell sensory mutations give the mutant +1 per level to perception rolls where that sense would benefit the player.  This sense senses the radiation where the mutant or robot is located, and there is no form or modification in regards to Microscopic or Telescopic.</p>

<p><strong>Smell:</strong> Feeling senses allow someone the human senses of smell.   Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type F subtype s or Fs.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> - The ability to smell water and the ambient humidity of an area.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type W subtype s or Ws.</p>

<p><strong>Gravitational Senses / Type G:</strong> Gravitational senses allow someone to detect gravitational lines of force.  This sense is not very handy on the face of a large planet like earth, but was a common mutation available to orbital pilots as it allowed them the ability to detect the gravitational  lines of force in zero gravity, and thus they never will never be lost and will always know where they are.  Additionally it made complex environments like the asteroid belts easier to navigate.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type G subtype S or Gs.</p>

<h5 id="taste">Taste</h5>

<p>These senses are picked up by the tongue and skin and fed into the brain as various forms of taste in the mouth.  It should be noted that any of these senses can be overloaded in environments with a lot of stimuli.  All smell sensory mutations give the mutant +1 per level to perception rolls where that sense would benefit the player.  This sense senses the radiation where the mutant or robot is located, and there is no form or modification in regards to Microscopic or Telescopic.</p>

<p><strong>Composition</strong> - This is the ability to sense the composition of a given object tasted.  This sense does not give the taster immunity to poisons, nor does this sense give them the desire to enjoy what they are tasting. In general this will cause things to taste worse. Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type C subtype t or Ct.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> - The ability to smell water and the ambient humidity of an area.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type W subtype T or Wt.</p>

<p><strong>Smell:</strong> Feeling senses allow someone the human senses of smell.   Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type Fs subtype T or Fst.</p>

<p><strong>Communications, Radio Waves:</strong> Communications, Radio Waves senses allow someone to pick up transmissions from communicators, radios, homing beacons and other devices that use radio waves or similar alternate methods to communicate over distances. A mutant who has this ability can see the radio waves and the communications channels but can not understand what is being communicated on those channels.  Robots have this sort of senses using a standard sensor package called Type C subtype V or Cv.  Robots will also generally not be able to understand the communications they receive on these channels unless they also have sufficient programming to decrypt any encrypted communication.

<h5 id="hearing">Hearing</h5>

<p>These senses are picked up by the ear and skin and fed into the brain as various forms of hearing in the ear.  It should be noted that any of these senses can be overloaded in environments with a lot of stimuli.  All smell sensory mutations give the mutant +1 per level to perception rolls where that sense would benefit the player.  This sense senses the radiation where the mutant or robot is located, and there is no form or modification in regards to Microscopic or Telescopic.</p>
