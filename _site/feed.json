            "content_text": "Why Hexcrawl?A good hexcrawl is not a travel simulator. It’s a structured uncertainty engine. It trades scripted plot for layered geography, living factions, shifting risk envelopes, and consequential navigation choices. The map is the argument of play: “What do you do next?”I’ve broken this into repeatable layers you can actually use at the table.Layer 1: Purpose Before ParchmentBefore you draw a single river ask:  What pressure pushes people outward? (Famine, war, prophecy, scarcity, mandate)  What resists encroachment? (Terrain, weather, curse zones, political interdictions)  What rewards deeper push? (Relics, fertile basins, lost routes, metaphysical leverage)  What changes if the region is fully mapped? (Shifts economy, unlocks factions, unleashes sealed threat)Write three sentences answering those. Everything else hangs off them. Put them in your referee notes margin. If something doesn’t serve one of those sentences, eject it.Layer 2: Scale &amp; DisciplineThree-Level Hex Zoom Cascade (36 → 6 → 1 Mile)This streamlined model keeps only three practical tiers: a broad strategic frame (36), the classic daily exploration layer (6), and the tactically precise local layer (1). Fewer tiers = faster prep and clearer player mental maps.36 Miles per Hex – Strategic Region  Use: Map large territories spanning multiple polities or sweeping frontier zones; establish macro terrain, major routes, and anchor regions.  Tactical Zoom Trigger: When players focus on a borderland, frontier, or specific kingdom segment — zoom to 6-mile hexes for wilderness-ready play.      Example Settings:          Iberian Peninsula (Reconquista arc)      British Isles (Viking or Saxon pressures)      Silk Road steppe / caravan corridor      6 Miles per Hex – Wilderness Exploration Core  Use: Primary hexcrawl layer; one hex ≈ a day’s mixed-foot travel (adjust for terrain). Stock anchors, active sites, and anomalies here.  Tactical Zoom Trigger: Approaching a keyed site cluster, settlement environs, complex valley, or battlefield — zoom to 1-mile hexes for spatial choices.      Example Settings:          Contested marches / border counties      Mountain basins &amp; upland plateaus      Great forest interiors / national parks analogs      1 Mile per Hex – Local Tactical Detail  Use: Site adjacency, farmland rings, fortress approaches, hamlet clusters, environmental micro-features; supports precise approach vectors.  Tactical Zoom Trigger: Entering settlement limits, staging an assault, micro‑navigating hazards, or transitioning to dungeon / structure / battle maps.      Example Settings:          Walled town + fields + mills      Fortified pass choke &amp; watch towers      Estate, quarry, or battlefield layout      Integrated Scale Cascade Table            Tier      Hex Size      Scope      Tactical Zoom Trigger      Examples                  1      36 mi      Strategic region      Focus narrows to frontier zone      Iberian Peninsula, British Isles              2      6 mi      Wilderness core      Approach a keyed/local site area      Border counties, mountain basins              3      1 mi      Local tactical      Enter settlement / assault / setup      Town fields, forts, estates        Multi-scale hex overlay (36 / 6 / 1 mile reference)                +      −      ⟳                    Drag to pan. Use buttons, mouse wheel, pinch (touch) to zoom, or reset.Layer 3: Minimal Base StockingStop trying to lovingly handcraft every cell. Seed with density bands:            Hex State      % of Region      Content Goal      Examples                  Anchor      5–10%      Campaign identity      Capital, Mythic ruin, Great river confluence              Active      15–25%      Drive decisions      Faction fort, Trade choke, Weather node              Lurking      25–35%      Delayed reveal      Sealed vault, Rotting god husk, Dormant colony              Empty (textured)      30–45%      Contrast &amp; travel pacing      Broken causeway, Burn scar plain, Chatter dunes      You only fully key Anchors and the first wave of Actives. Lurking slots get a one-line seed. Empties get a terrain note + a travel complication die.Layer 4: Terrain = Decision PressureEvery terrain tag should do work:  Alter navigation cost  Modulate encounter table composition  Convey risk signals (auras, carcasses, weather signatures)  Telegraph deeper structure (river direction implies mountain ridge, basalt flows imply old catastrophe)Add one anomaly per 6–8 hexes: inverted waterfall, glassed crater ridge, migrating sinkholes. Players remember anomalies more than generic forests.Layer 5: Encounter ArchitectureEncounters are not random events; they’re state probes.Daily Encounter Procedure (example):  Morning: Weather shift / omen check  Midday: Navigation hazard OR social contact  Afternoon: Predator / territorial assertion  Night: Camp complication / haunting / pursuit catch-upUse different dice per zone (d8 civilized edge, d10 frontier, d12 deep) to widen variance.Encounter Table Structure (d12):  1–3: Terrain expression (living geology, weather burst)  4–5: Faction patrol / scout / courier  6: Resource cache / salvage / spoor  7–8: Creature with motive intersecting party vector  9: Consequence echo from prior choice (fire spreads, rumor manifests)  10: Lurking site teaser  11: Environmental escalation (storm front walls travel, fae tide rises)  12: Clock advancement / front progressionEach result should ask a question back: Who sent them? What do you do with it? Do you press on? If a result doesn’t change player calculus it’s ornamental; cut it.Layer 6: Time &amp; ClocksKeep three visible pressure dials:            Clock      Segments      Advances When                  Frontier Consolidation      6      PCs map anchor + report / Faction treaty              Sleeping Engine Wakes      8      Arcane extraction, seismic events              Famine Wave      4      Supply convoy lost / harvest delayed      Mark segments on triggered encounters. When a clock fills, it re-keys 3–5 hexes (change occupants / conditions) and you tell the players what shifted. The world moves.Layer 7: Travel Turn Loop (Referee Card)I keep a simple loop card:HEX TURN LOOP1 Declare destination / vector2 Check route known? If not -&gt; navigation test3 Mark movement (log hex ID) &amp; decrement light/rations/water4 Terrain feature? (if first entry) -&gt; describe + question5 Encounter slot resolution6 Player actions (scout, forage, track, research, ritual)7 Log notable state changesPlayers learn this rhythm and start pre-planning actions at step 1.Layer 8: Information EconomyPlayers decide better when information has tiers:  Vague rumor (region-level: “South marsh breathes at night”)  Directional sign (terrain cue: “Trees bent inland”)  Confirming detail (multi-sense: “Pulsing heat ripples over mud”)  Immediate hook (actionable: “Steam vents align like a rune circle”)Reward triangulation: if they collect three independent confirms, grant a tactical advantage tag (e.g. +1 initiative in that hex type, skip first hazard roll, negotiate from strength).Layer 9: Resource Tension Without Bean CountingTrack only deltas that affect decisions:  Light: Safe navigation at night / reduces ambush chance  Food: Force risk-taking if low (forage table may escalate clocks)  Encumbrance Band: Normal / Strained / Overloaded (each band adds cost or slows hex rate)Abstract ammo unless the fiction demands scarcity. Let weather + terrain be your meaningful attrition.Layer 10: Factions as Mobile TerrainTreat factions like shifting terrain overlays:  Patrol zones (expand / retract based on clocks)  Influence markers in hexes (affect encounter substitutions)  Supply lines (cutting them rewrites future tables)Give each major faction a stance matrix (Need, Fear, Leverage). An encounter can flip one cell. Progress visible.Layer 11: Emergent Sites On DemandWhen players laser-focus an empty-ish hex:  Roll / pick one Lurking seed to mature early  Add a terrain anomaly to justify why it was hidden  Tie it to an advancing clock or faction motive  Drop a choice fork: deeper delve, bargain, escalate riskThis keeps prep elastic and responsive.Layer 12: Mapping Conventions Players SeeShow them a cleaned layer (rivers, coasts, major ridges). Let player map evolves with:  Dashed outline = uncertain edge  Icon with circle = confirmed site  Hollow icon = rumored site  Color wash = hazard zone (after 2+ confirmations)They will begin setting their own vector goals. Momentum happens when I ask less “What now?” and more “Are you changing plan?”Layer 13: Failure Is CartographicMissed navigation? Don’t say “You’re lost.” Say: “You emerge at a basalt rim with steam fissures—this is Hex H13; your intended vector shifts one column east unless you backtrack (costs 1 watch). Proceed?”Failure produces new known geography plus a resource or time tax. Nothing dead-ends. Even ambushes should teach about faction reach or terrain teeth.Layer 14: Session Close State LogAt end of session capture:  Hexes entered (ID list)  New / changed sites  Clocks advanced (segments + triggers)  Faction state flips  Resource bands crossed  Outstanding player-declared goalsThis lets you re-key or escalate surgically, not wholesale.Quick Reference TablesTerrain Complication (d8)1 Sudden grade / scree field (slow)2 Torrent surge cuts route3 Swarming insects (disadvantage on Perception / Listen)4 Heat shimmer / mirage masks ridge line5 Rot fog (choose: detour or Constitution saves)6 Territorial scent posts (foreshadow predator)7 Slumped earth reveals ancient paving8 Electromagnetic crackle disrupts compassesForage Outcome (d6)1 Nothing; sign of overuse2 Low yield; reduces one hunger band3 Adequate; stabilize food4 Rich pocket; bonus + omen sign5 Dangerous cluster; encounter check at +26 Rare herb / catalyst; trade leverageWeather Shift (d10)1 Static. 2 Pressure drop omen. 3 Sudden wind shear. 4 Horizon wall cloud. 5 Needle rain. 6 Radiant cold inversion. 7 Lightning crawl along ground. 8 Rolling fog banks. 9 Skyglow aurora thread. 10 Cycle reset with anomaly.Closing PrincipleA hexcrawl thrives when procedures produce fiction the players want to interrogate. If you feel like you’re pushing them, pull back. Tighten your loops, sharpen anomalies, surface clearer questions. The wilderness will start talking. Let them choose how to answer.Run fewer prep marathons. Run tighter cycles with higher information yield.",

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up FrontThis article draws from notes taken during a discussion between a Harvard Business School professor, Joeseph Fuller. and OpenAI’s Chief Economist, Ronnie Chatterji on the future of work and talent in an AI-driven world.The integration of AI into the electric utility industry’s supporting capabilities will significantly reshape workforce roles, placing greater emphasis on human skills such as empathy and communication. Organizations must proactively prepare employees through structured experiential learning, new management skills for overseeing virtual AI colleagues, and reconfiguring workflows to align with AI best practices. Immediate actions include conducting skills audits, initiating regular training workshops, and developing specialized AI oversight roles to effectively navigate this essential transition.Building a Lego CatMy daughter, Hannah, spent months carefully saving every penny she earned, eagerly anticipating the moment she could finally purchase an elaborate Tuxedo Cat Lego set. When the Lego set arrived, she sat down, excited but a bit overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of the pieces laid before us. Initially, she thought she could simply dive in and complete the project quickly, relying solely on her enthusiasm and the provided instructions. But soon, she realized the value of seeking guidance from me and her brother, as both of us had built similar complex models before. It wasn’t just about following instructions; it was about benefiting from experienced insights, learning proven techniques, and understanding the underlying principles of constructing something new and intricate. Hannah’s initial hesitation and gradual confidence mirror the uncertainty and eventual empowerment employees may feel during significant organizational changes.We stand at the threshold of immense change. Generative AI isn’t simply a new tool—it’s a fundamental shift in how we manage talent and workflow. Roles previously stable will evolve dramatically, with some opportunities closing and new ones emerging.Organizations must proactively guide their teams through this transition, helping employees identify skills worth cultivating. When routine tasks become automated, what remains valuable? The answer lies in distinctly human capabilities: social interactions, emotional intelligence, and nuanced interpersonal skills. These soft skills, often overlooked, will soon become paramount.Yet, many anticipate AI adoption as an overnight shift—a binary moment. Reality, however, is more nuanced, with changes unfolding gradually across industries. In the electric utility industry, complexities such as regulatory hurdles, operational reliability, and legacy technology infrastructure naturally slow technology adoption. We’re in transition, and it’s unrealistic to immediately expect incoming talent to fully embrace new AI competencies without the guidance of those who’ve navigated similar changes before.This is a call for organizational reflection. Traditional roles must be reconsidered—perhaps the countless PowerPoint presentations we’ve grown accustomed to would be more effectively delivered interactively through AI-driven agents or bots. For example, internal HR briefings might transform into AI-driven systems that provide personalized answers on employee benefits or career development paths, significantly improving employee satisfaction and reducing administrative workload.AI will reshape organizational structures dramatically. Today, typical corporate hierarchies consist of executives (1%), managers (9%), and employees (90%). While AI will not change this ratio, it will change 41% of the tasks typically handled by employees. We might see fewer managerial layers, more specialized AI oversight roles such as AI Ethics Managers or AI Integration Specialists, and agile cross-functional teams emphasizing human-AI collaboration within supporting capabilities such as HR analytics, finance budgeting, or procurement strategy. Additionally, employees will increasingly manage virtual AI team members, requiring them to develop management-oriented skills previously expected only from supervisors or managers, such as task delegation, workflow oversight, and performance monitoring.The sluggish pace of AI integration often stems from the question: “How can we use this to improve our current processes?” It’s a natural response to something like AI, but adopting this mindset is limiting. A transformative approach asks instead: “How can we fundamentally reconfigure our processes to fully leverage AI, aligning ourselves with the best practices AI inherently understands?” For instance, instead of merely enhancing current financial reporting processes, utilities might entirely reimagine budgeting and forecasting using AI-driven financial analytics platforms, enabling real-time insights, reduced errors, and enhanced decision-making speed.Legacy firms, including electric utilities, face substantial risk if they focus on just improving their processes and resist wholesale re-engineering their workflows. New generative AI startups, unhindered by traditional structures and regulatory baggage, pose significant competitive threats by rapidly adopting AI-driven methodologies in supporting areas like automated HR processes to streamline recruitment, intelligent procurement systems to enhance supply chain efficiency, AI-driven finance analytics for precise and agile budgeting, and virtual training and onboarding programs to rapidly equip employees with necessary skills. Delaying adoption can place utilities at a severe competitive disadvantage.Experiential learning emerges as critical to navigating this shift. Employees and leaders must engage in hands-on, interactive education guided by AI veterans who’ve also successfully navigated technological and organizational transitions in the past. For supporting capabilities, this might look like HR teams regularly practicing with AI-driven recruitment and retention tools, finance departments running real-time analytics exercises for agile budgeting, or procurement teams conducting simulations with intelligent supply-chain management software. Regular practice—meaning structured activities scheduled consistently, such as weekly workshops or monthly training sessions—accelerates comfort, reduces resistance to adoption, minimizes errors, enhances productivity, and ensures smoother transitions, particularly in risk-averse environments like utilities.It’s natural for employees to experience concern or uncertainty about the integration of AI into their roles. Organizations must proactively acknowledge and address these concerns, reassuring employees through clear communication, education, and demonstrating how AI complements rather than replaces their expertise.To effectively prepare for this new emphasis on soft skills, organizations should first clearly identify the interpersonal and emotional competencies most relevant to their industry and workforce. Skills such as empathy, active listening, effective communication, and emotional intelligence can be assessed through targeted surveys, feedback sessions, and performance reviews. Once identified, training can include role-playing scenarios, peer-to-peer coaching, interactive workshops, and continuous feedback mechanisms, ensuring that these essential human skills are cultivated deliberately and effectively.Actions to Take Now  Conduct a skills audit to identify human-centered skills that will grow in importance.  Launch structured, regular AI experiential learning workshops.  Establish clear communication channels addressing employee concerns about AI adoption.  Begin piloting AI solutions in supporting capability areas, like HR, procurement, or finance.  Foster mentorship programs connecting AI veterans with employees new to AI technology.  Define specialized AI roles and begin developing talent internally to fill these positions.Returning to the Lego set, Hannah quickly learned the value of expert advice. She discovered strategies that streamlined our building process and deepened our enjoyment of the project. It wasn’t about doing everything ourselves or suddenly becoming Lego masters overnight—it was about recognizing the wisdom and experience available around us. Similarly, our organizational journey with AI should rely on insights from those who’ve faced parallel challenges. Embracing their expertise, we’re better equipped to build a future that’s innovative, resilient, and deeply human. Hannah’s growing confidence and eventual joy in mastering the complex Lego set can similarly reflect the emotional journey employees will experience as they adopt and master new AI-driven processes.

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front:Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the enterprise software landscape, challenging established methods and requiring utilities and other large enterprises to rethink their technological strategies fundamentally. To thrive, organizations must shift from static, infrastructure-bound solutions toward agile, adaptive systems empowered by AI-driven, “just-in-time” capabilities. Embracing this transformation proactively, with awareness of both opportunities and inherent challenges, will be essential for resilience and sustained innovation.e: “Rooted in Resilience: Navigating the AI Revolution in Enterprise SaaS”Every autumn, when the Santa Ana winds sweep across Southern California, I watch how the landscape responds. Some trees and plants stand firm, deeply rooted, unaffected by the fierce gusts. Others, fragile or poorly anchored, bend and break under the relentless force. Observing this annual dance, I’m reminded how resilience—whether in nature, our communities, or our enterprises—depends profoundly on how deeply and securely we anchor ourselves when inevitable storms arrive.Working in a large utility enterprise, where our reliance on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions and legacy on-premise or on-device software forms the backbone of our daily operations, we often feel secure in our technological roots. It has served us well for years, and we have invested decades perfecting it. Yet, a new storm is gathering on the horizon: artificial intelligence. It’s neither distant nor theoretical anymore; it’s here, and it’s reshaping the landscape faster than many anticipated. Our traditional software—carefully built, maintained, and often bound by physical infrastructure—faces unprecedented disruption. To thrive—not merely survive—we must understand what this storm means for both our existing systems and future strategies.Recently, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared a fascinating vision of the future of AI, particularly its implications for B2B SaaS companies. Reflecting on this, I felt a familiar tug at my spirit—a blend of apprehension and excitement. Altman’s perspective is particularly relevant because it directly addresses the existential questions that large enterprises and their technology groups face today. Here’s an edited and expanded excerpt from an interview that deeply resonated with me:  Interviewer: “So one of the things that we’ve been debating at Y-Combinator is whether Artificial Intelligence is inherently good. It might be scary for software engineering companies creating B2B SaaS solutions. Imagine a future where each user has their underlying database. There’s an API layer integrated with your identity for access control, enforcing business logic, ensuring only the right people access the right information. An interface to a large language model (LLM) replaces your computer, creating just-in-time software tailored to your immediate needs. Say you have a complex business issue; you go to your machine, and it generates the exact code, artifact, or document needed—or retrieves it instantly from your filesystem when required again.”  Sam Altman: “That’s going to happen. There are two ways you can approach this. First, you can see this as the best time ever for startups because everything is shifting dramatically. Yes, as a Cloud SaaS company, it might feel unsettling that code we once carefully crafted could soon be generated instantly and automatically. It forces us to ask: What does this mean for us?”  “Alternatively, you might view this as an extraordinary leveling of the playing field. Traditionally, large enterprises held advantages—deep pockets, wide distribution—but their slow pace often held them back. Now, AI changes that calculus dramatically. It’s inexpensive compared to its enormous benefits, diminishing traditional advantages of scale and budget. The software landscape, as we’ve known it, is about to change completely.”  “The challenges AI brings are universal—no one is immune. But here’s the crucial insight: when the industry’s clock cycle shifts, as it is now, from Moore’s Law to the rapid iteration pace set by AI, startups historically win. The magnitude of this change is unprecedented. Act accordingly, with an entrepreneurial spirit. Companies concerned about defensibility might say, ‘We’re just a SaaS company,’ while others confidently declare, ‘We’re a just-in-time software company.’”Altman’s insights bring into sharp focus the critical truth facing those of us entrenched in large, enterprise SaaS environments. Change is no longer incremental—it is seismic. AI isn’t just another storm; it’s a hurricane. Within our own IT Technology Strategy Group, we’ve engaged in lengthy discussions about this transformative shift—imagining future software as expansive cloud-based databases wrapped in layers of “self-driving software” that dynamically adapt to the evolving needs of users on any given day. Practically, this means software would anticipate user tasks, automatically adjusting workflows, creating real-time customizations, and proactively offering solutions, much like a skilled assistant who learns your preferences and anticipates your next request. This upheaval is an invitation to transform—to deepen our roots in adaptability, agility, and vision.This change echoes another pivotal shift from our company’s past. When we first approached electrification, it was as revolutionary then as AI feels today. For example, the transformative moment of electrifying Los Angeles in 1917 marked a profound shift in industry and daily life. We offered cities and large organizations the ability to delegate their energy challenges—generation, transmission, and distribution—to us. In turn, we provided a reliable grid where consumers could easily plug in their tailored, just-in-time tools: refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and, more recently, electric cars. Similarly, industries connected their factories, assembly lines, lights, fans, industrial equipment, and today’s robotic factories manufacturing electric vehicles. This historical analogy reminds us of our inherent strength in embracing change and innovation. We should recognize this pattern clearly, understand its implications, and resonate with its call for agility and adaptability today, just as we did a century ago.As leaders and contributors in utility companies deeply reliant on SaaS, we must internalize Altman’s wisdom: embracing AI means reevaluating not only our technology stacks but also our fundamental strategies and mindsets. Our ability to swiftly respond to immediate needs, rather than leaning solely on static, prebuilt software, could redefine how effectively we serve our customers and maintain our infrastructures.Yes, storms can uproot, disrupt, and devastate. But they also clear away the old, providing fertile ground for fresh, vibrant growth. Perhaps this AI-driven tempest is precisely what we need—a compelling reason to reassess and recommit ourselves to innovation, resilience, and proactive transformation. Yet, we should also recognize that this transformative journey may face challenges: employee resistance, uncertainty about changing roles, and apprehension about adopting entirely new ways of working. Acknowledging these obstacles openly can help us navigate them thoughtfully and compassionately.In the face of uncertainty, let’s choose not merely to withstand but to flourish. After all, deep roots don’t fear storms—they welcome them.",

To thrive, organizations must shift from static, infrastructure-bound solutions toward agile, adaptive systems empowered by AI-driven, “just-in-time” capabilities. Embracing this transformation proactively, with awareness of both opportunities and inherent challenges, will be essential for resilience and sustained innovation.</em>e: “Rooted in Resilience: Navigating the AI Revolution in Enterprise SaaS”</p><p>Every autumn, when the Santa Ana winds sweep across Southern California, I watch how the landscape responds. Some trees and plants stand firm, deeply rooted, unaffected by the fierce gusts. Others, fragile or poorly anchored, bend and break under the relentless force. Observing this annual dance, I’m reminded how resilience—whether in nature, our communities, or our enterprises—depends profoundly on how deeply and securely we anchor ourselves when inevitable storms arrive.</p><p>Working in a large utility enterprise, where our reliance on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions and legacy on-premise or on-device software forms the backbone of our daily operations, we often feel secure in our technological roots. It has served us well for years, and we have invested decades perfecting it. Yet, a new storm is gathering on the horizon: artificial intelligence. It’s neither distant nor theoretical anymore; it’s here, and it’s reshaping the landscape faster than many anticipated. Our traditional software—carefully built, maintained, and often bound by physical infrastructure—faces unprecedented disruption. To thrive—not merely survive—we must understand what this storm means for both our existing systems and future strategies.</p><p>Recently, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared a fascinating vision of the future of AI, particularly its implications for B2B SaaS companies. Reflecting on this, I felt a familiar tug at my spirit—a blend of apprehension and excitement. Altman’s perspective is particularly relevant because it directly addresses the existential questions that large enterprises and their technology groups face today. Here’s an edited and expanded excerpt from an interview that deeply resonated with me:</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> “So one of the things that we’ve been debating at Y-Combinator is whether Artificial Intelligence is inherently good. It might be scary for software engineering companies creating B2B SaaS solutions. Imagine a future where each user has their underlying database. There’s an API layer integrated with your identity for access control, enforcing business logic, ensuring only the right people access the right information. An interface to a large language model (LLM) replaces your computer, creating just-in-time software tailored to your immediate needs. Say you have a complex business issue; you go to your machine, and it generates the exact code, artifact, or document needed—or retrieves it instantly from your filesystem when required again.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p><strong>Sam Altman:</strong> “That’s going to happen. There are two ways you can approach this. First, you can see this as the best time ever for startups because everything is shifting dramatically. Yes, as a Cloud SaaS company, it might feel unsettling that code we once carefully crafted could soon be generated instantly and automatically. It forces us to ask: What does this mean for us?”</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>“Alternatively, you might view this as an extraordinary leveling of the playing field. Traditionally, large enterprises held advantages—deep pockets, wide distribution—but their slow pace often held them back. Now, AI changes that calculus dramatically. It’s inexpensive compared to its enormous benefits, diminishing traditional advantages of scale and budget. The software landscape, as we’ve known it, is about to change completely.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>“The challenges AI brings are universal—no one is immune. But here’s the crucial insight: when the industry’s clock cycle shifts, as it is now, from Moore’s Law to the rapid iteration pace set by AI, startups historically win. The magnitude of this change is unprecedented. Act accordingly, with an entrepreneurial spirit. Companies concerned about defensibility might say, ‘We’re just a SaaS company,’ while others confidently declare, ‘We’re a just-in-time software company.’”</p></blockquote><p>Altman’s insights bring into sharp focus the critical truth facing those of us entrenched in large, enterprise SaaS environments. Change is no longer incremental—it is seismic. AI isn’t just another storm; it’s a hurricane. Within our own IT Technology Strategy Group, we’ve engaged in lengthy discussions about this transformative shift—imagining future software as expansive cloud-based databases wrapped in layers of “self-driving software” that dynamically adapt to the evolving needs of users on any given day. Practically, this means software would anticipate user tasks, automatically adjusting workflows, creating real-time customizations, and proactively offering solutions, much like a skilled assistant who learns your preferences and anticipates your next request. This upheaval is an invitation to transform—to deepen our roots in adaptability, agility, and vision.</p><p>This change echoes another pivotal shift from our company’s past. When we first approached electrification, it was as revolutionary then as AI feels today. For example, the transformative moment of electrifying Los Angeles in 1917 marked a profound shift in industry and daily life. We offered cities and large organizations the ability to delegate their energy challenges—generation, transmission, and distribution—to us. In turn, we provided a reliable grid where consumers could easily plug in their tailored, just-in-time tools: refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and, more recently, electric cars. Similarly, industries connected their factories, assembly lines, lights, fans, industrial equipment, and today’s robotic factories manufacturing electric vehicles. This historical analogy reminds us of our inherent strength in embracing change and innovation. We should recognize this pattern clearly, understand its implications, and resonate with its call for agility and adaptability today, just as we did a century ago.</p><p>As leaders and contributors in utility companies deeply reliant on SaaS, we must internalize Altman’s wisdom: embracing AI means reevaluating not only our technology stacks but also our fundamental strategies and mindsets. Our ability to swiftly respond to immediate needs, rather than leaning solely on static, prebuilt software, could redefine how effectively we serve our customers and maintain our infrastructures.</p><p>Yes, storms can uproot, disrupt, and devastate. But they also clear away the old, providing fertile ground for fresh, vibrant growth. Perhaps this AI-driven tempest is precisely what we need—a compelling reason to reassess and recommit ourselves to innovation, resilience, and proactive transformation. Yet, we should also recognize that this transformative journey may face challenges: employee resistance, uncertainty about changing roles, and apprehension about adopting entirely new ways of working. Acknowledging these obstacles openly can help us navigate them thoughtfully and compassionately.</p><p>In the face of uncertainty, let’s choose not merely to withstand but to flourish. After all, deep roots don’t fear storms—they welcome them.</p>",

AI is no longer a futuristic concept or mere hype—it’s a present reality being adopted at unprecedented speed, transforming how people work, communicate, and make decisions. This post reflects on how these trends, backed by significant investment and rapid adoption, intersect with the everyday experiences of employees across industries, viewed through the lens of a weekend campout with my son. Whether you’re navigating complexity intentionally or exploring new tools with curiosity, AI’s trajectory will impact your role, your workflow, and your future.Last weekend, Pieter and I embarked on the annual father-son campout with our church. At nearly twelve years old, Pieter eagerly set up the tent and organized our campsite before running off to join the other kids exploring the creek. Some were chasing toads, others carefully scooping up tadpoles in small nets, delighting in each discovery. The next morning, we planned to head to the lake for fishing and water sports, but first, we needed to figure out how to get to the marina from the campsite. The directions initially led us astray, guiding us to a beachside parking lot meant for swimmers, not boaters. Calm and focused, Pieter navigated us with precision, reading the signs and adjusting as needed until we arrived at the marina and boat launch—well before anyone else. His quiet confidence and situational awareness reminded me of the thoughtful problem-solving and adaptability today’s workforce needs to navigate complex situations and plan ahead.Reflecting later in the quiet solitude of our tent, I realized how aptly this mirrors the explosive growth we are witnessing in artificial intelligence. Just as Pieter charted the right path to the marina by connecting scattered pieces of information, today’s breakthroughs in AI—each impressive on its own—are coming together to form a coherent, accelerating force that is reshaping our shared future.This week, Mary Meeker is a renowned venture capitalist and former Wall Street analyst, often called the “Queen of the Internet” for her decades of tech foresight. This week, she published her latest report on current AI trends, highlighting an unprecedented pace of adoption and investment. According to the findings, AI’s expansion is surpassing even the internet boom of the late ’90s and early 2000s, driven by significant global connectivity, extensive datasets, and groundbreaking technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.The report reveals compelling statistics: ChatGPT amassed 800 million weekly active users within just 17 months, marking an astonishing eight-fold increase since its inception. Additionally, tech giants—Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—have ramped up their capital expenditure by an astounding 63% year-over-year, underscoring their substantial commitment to the infrastructure needed to support AI’s rapid growth. Clearly, these rapid adoption figures signal more than incremental technological advances—they highlight transformative shifts enterprises must strategically navigate.Beyond impressive figures lies the profound impact AI holds for our daily lives, workplaces, and society at large. We are witnessing the rise of intelligent, autonomous agents capable of streamlining complex, mundane tasks—a shift comparable to the revolutionary transition from static websites to dynamic web applications decades ago. Consider AI-powered document summarizers that help employees quickly digest long reports or customer feedback, allowing them to focus more time on analysis and action rather than sorting through information. In many ways, these agents are like Pieter on our campout—quietly analyzing the environment, piecing together incomplete directions, and guiding us where we need to go. Today, AI helps employees draft communications, schedule meetings, respond to customer inquiries, and generate insights from large data sets. It’s helping us move forward with clarity, even when the path isn’t fully marked.As employees navigating this transformative era, we all have a role to play in understanding and adapting to the changing nature of work. Whether you’re in operations, customer service, finance, or IT, the rise of AI presents new tools, new expectations, and new opportunities to create value. Our challenge isn’t just to adopt AI technologies—but to do so in a way that enhances our work, builds trust, and contributes to a thoughtful, human-centered workplace.Driving home from the campout, Pieter sat in the passenger seat, laser-focused on spotting every sports car we passed—calling out Porsches, Mustangs, and the occasional Corvette like a seasoned car enthusiast. As we passed each one, he wasn’t just admiring their style—he was curious about how they handled the road, how fast they could go, and what made each of them unique. It reminded me of that moment earlier in the weekend, when he had calmly led us down the winding dirt road to the marina. He wasn’t just following directions—he was reading the terrain, noticing the signs others missed, and navigating with confidence and clarity. That same curiosity and initiative—asking questions, exploring details, and making informed decisions—are just as essential when we experiment with new technologies in our workplaces. Isn’t that what we’re trying to do with AI? We’re navigating unfamiliar terrain. We’re building a path with partial information. And we’re doing our best to get there ahead of the curve. Some people will use AI as a high-performance tool—to reach a destination faster, with more precision. Others will treat it more like a Sunday drive—exploring what’s possible, tinkering, learning, and enjoying the ride, especially those less steeped in technical roles but eager to experiment and adapt. Both paths have value, and both will shape the road ahead—and organizations that support both approaches will be best positioned to thrive. As we guide these technologies into the future, may we do so with the same mix of curiosity, competence, and care that Pieter showed—not just moving fast, but moving wisely.",

Isn’t that what we’re trying to do with AI? We’re navigating unfamiliar terrain. We’re building a path with partial information. And we’re doing our best to get there ahead of the curve. Some people will use AI as a high-performance tool—to reach a destination faster, with more precision. Others will treat it more like a Sunday drive—exploring what’s possible, tinkering, learning, and enjoying the ride, especially those less steeped in technical roles but eager to experiment and adapt. Both paths have value, and both will shape the road ahead—and organizations that support both approaches will be best positioned to thrive. As we guide these technologies into the future, may we do so with the same mix of curiosity, competence, and care that Pieter showed—not just moving fast, but moving wisely.</p>",

            "content_text": "This week’s post is a departure from my typical approach, moving from broader reflections into the specifics of actionable frameworks. Last week, I introduced the, highlighting its potential to clarify and focus your organization’s generative AI strategy. Today, we’ll dive deeper, taking a serious and practical look at how this method can concretely identify the impacts—and opportunities—AI brings to your everyday work. If you’re interested in understanding how WINS applies to your specific workflows, reach out—I’d be happy to help you conduct a personalized WINS evaluation.Understanding WINSIf your job involves creating, consuming, analyzing, or transforming WINS, you’re not just likely to benefit from AI—you’re in its direct path of influence. The more your role is centered around these types of information, the more impact AI can have—either through automation, acceleration, or augmentation. Evaluate your workflows:  Classify your tasks using the four categories below. As you do this, estimate what percentage of your work falls into Categories 1 through 3 (WINS-ready work) versus Category 4 (non-WINS work). This ratio will help you later prioritize where AI can have the most immediate impact and where it can be safely ignored for now.  Identify digitization levels and immediate AI opportunities. As you do this, don’t just estimate the percentage of work—estimate the cost. How much of your organizational spend (time working, time waiting, tools, labor, or outsourced services) goes toward WINS-ready work (Categories 1–3) versus non-WINS work (Category 4)? This cost-based ratio will be critical later for understanding the financial opportunity of AI adoption. If a large percentage of cost is tied up in WINS-ready tasks, that’s where AI can provide the greatest ROI. If some of your WINS-ready work is not yet digitized, note it—because the first step to AI enablement is digital access.Categorizing Your WorkflowTo effectively assess AI’s impact, categorize your workflows into four groups:1. Completely AI-Automatable Processes - These are tasks where you start with WINS content and end by producing more WINS content. For example:  Drafting HR communications using employee feedback and survey results  Composing legal memos from precedent documents and regulatory text  Generating quarterly financial reports from transaction and performance data  Creating training guides from product documentationIn each of these cases, the inputs and outputs are purely digital and WINS-based—making them strong candidates for full automation with AI.2. AI-Accelerated Processes - These are tasks where your actions—physical, cognitive, or collaborative—lead to the creation of new WINS content. For example:  Summarizing and drafting follow-ups from team meetings or customer calls.  Developing policies based on input from various stakeholders.  Creating visual aids like slides or infographics to accompany strategies or presentations.  Recording voice narration or entering data after observing or completing a specific process.In these situations, you’re doing something—thinking, planning, speaking, designing—and the result is a new document, visual, dataset, or recording. AI can dramatically reduce the time it takes to generate the initial version of this content. Think of it as a digital drafting assistant. It won’t do the whole job, but it gives you a strong head start so you can spend your energy on refining, validating, and aligning the output with your goals and audience.3. AI-Supported Processes - These are tasks where WINS content—such as data, documents, visuals, or recordings—inform or influence something that happens beyond the digital realm. For example:  Using customer feedback to guide how a team interacts with clients.  Reviewing performance dashboards before making staffing or budgeting decisions.  Reading legal advice before conducting negotiations.  Referring to safety policies before performing physical work.In these situations, the WINS content supports action, but the action itself involves people, environments, or real-world decisions. AI can improve the quality, speed, and clarity of the inputs, helping you prepare better and act faster—but the real impact happens offline. This makes AI a valuable assistant for preparation, but not a replacement for the human who takes the final action.4. AI-Ignorable Processes - These are tasks that don’t rely on WINS content at all—activities where neither the input nor the output involves words, images, numbers, or sounds. However, it’s important to note that some work may appear to fall in Categories 1 through 3 but remains undigitized, meaning the underlying WINS content hasn’t yet been captured in a digital form. In these cases, even though the task is conceptually WINS-based, it should be treated as Category 4 until digitization occurs. Review these areas for digitization opportunities.For example:  Engaging in face-to-face conversations with people.  Repairing equipment or addressing issues like downed power lines.  Leading team retreats or mentoring colleagues.  Assembling, installing hardware, or conducting physical inspections.These jobs are rooted in direct action, physical presence, or human connection—things AI cannot simulate or substitute. For these tasks, AI doesn’t play a role today and likely won’t for the foreseeable future. That means you can safely deprioritize AI in these areas and focus your attention on more digitally centric opportunities.Using that informationNow that you have the two percentages one for Cost and one for Scope, you can plot that on a chart and divide that into a 2 x 2 matrix.Immediate AI Impact (High-Cost x High-Scope) - Highly digitized and heavily reliant on tasks involving Words, Images, Numbers, and Sounds (WINS).Implications of Immediate AI Impact  Rapid AI adoption crucial to remain relevant in a world transformed by AI.  Tasks will become faster, cheaper, and more efficient.  AI skilled employees quickly becoming essential.Strategic Insights for Immediate AI ImpactAI is transforming fields like software development, finance, education, and professional services. Early adoption enhances productivity and creativity. Leaders should invest in AI literacy and skills, enabling effective collaboration with AI tools. Swift integration of AI ensures relevance and opens opportunities for innovation and growth.Digitization Opportunity (High-Cost x Low-Scope) - Significant untapped WINS potential limited by lack of digitization.Implications of Digitization Opportunity  Opportunity to digitize processes for enhanced customer engagement and operational efficiency.  AI enables personalized, realistic, and imaginative customer interactions.Strategic Insights for the Utility in Digitization OpportunitiesAI-driven digitization benefits electric utilities in infrastructure planning, customer communication, and field operations. AI-enhanced visualization clarifies projects for communities, boosting public trust. AI digitizes maintenance records, enabling predictive analytics to enhance equipment reliability and reduce downtime. Early adoption of digital customer interactions, such as personalized outage notifications and AI-assisted service, improves satisfaction and responsiveness. Digitizing these areas boosts long-term efficiency, regulatory compliance, and competitive advantage.Strategic AI Advantage (Low-Cost x High-Scope) - Heavily digitized but not primarily WINS-based, yet capable of benefits from AI.Implications of Strategic AI Advantage  Enhanced productivity in critical supporting functions  Accelerates processes, improves quality, and reduces costs.  GenAI as a foundational productivity skill across the workforce.Strategic Insights for the Utility in Strategic AI AdvantageElectric utilities can benefit from AI in areas like regulatory compliance, supply chain management, and workforce training. AI-driven automation can streamline compliance processes and reduce errors. AI can optimize procurement and inventory forecasting, cutting operational costs and enhancing supply chain resilience. AI-enabled training simulations help staff quickly build skills, boosting safety and productivity. Adopting AI thoughtfully can improve efficiency, agility, and competitiveness for utilities.Long-Term AI Potential (Low Cost x Low Scope) - Capabilities with low digitization and minimal reliance on WINS tasks, typically involving physical labor or product creation.Implications of Long-Term AI Potential  Immediate AI urgency is low, but productivity gains can still be rapidly realized.  Early AI initiatives can yield positive EBITDA impacts within the first yearStrategic Insights for the Utility in Long-Term AI PotentialElectric utilities have gradual opportunities for AI integration in field maintenance, equipment installation, and inspections. AI-enhanced drones or robotic inspections can improve infrastructure assessments’ accuracy, safety, and speed. AI tools for scheduling, asset tracking, and safety analytics can enhance manual operations and deliver productivity improvements and cost savings quickly. These initial steps lay a foundation for deeper digital integration and long-term competitive advantage.Your Next StepsUsing WINS clearly identifies your organization’s opportunities and risks in adopting AI. Proactively embrace AI, understanding its potential and responsibly managing its limitations.AI isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about freeing your teams to focus more on meaningful, creative, and inherently human activities, driving your organization toward a more purposeful and productive future.Leave a comment if you need help with the Framework!",

            "content_text": "We sat together on a quiet stretch of sand near Hanalei Pier, savoring the final evening of our time in Hawaiʻi. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind trails of soft pink and gold, colors spilling gently across the Pacific like watercolor paints stirred slowly in clear water. Hannah and Lainey had wandered toward the shoreline, their silhouettes small against the ocean’s vast expanse, their laughter mingling effortlessly with the rhythmic whisper of rolling waves as they played carefree with their brother and cousins.I had my camera out, capturing these fleeting moments, hoping to preserve the feeling of this night, this final evening. Scrolling through each image later, I retraced our journey—the tastes, sounds, laughter, quiet conversations, and the subtle moments we had all shared as a family.In the enterprise and AI world, we’re experiencing what can only be described as a tectonic shift—a slow, yet profound collapse of familiar boundaries. For a long time, the acronym WINS helped us neatly categorize the modalities of human effort: Words, Images, Numbers, and Sounds. We built tools around these categories—Word for crafting documents, Photoshop for images, Excel for numbers, recorders for capturing voices, songs, speeches, and conversations.Yet these were always tasks humans guided carefully. We translated spoken discussions into text. We transformed raw data into meaningful insights. We interpreted language across disciplines. Each process depended inherently on human understanding, human nuance.But something strange is happening.The walls separating these boxes have begun to thin. In some places, they’ve vanished completely.AI now effortlessly moves between these modalities. A spreadsheet transforms into a chart, the chart into a clear paragraph, that paragraph into an engaging script set to music—ultimately becoming a video tutorial needing little, if any, human intervention. The beautiful boundary we once knew, the division between human tasks and machine tasks, is rapidly dissolving. This isn’t simply automation—it’s convergence. And it’s happening faster than most enterprises are prepared to admit.In this new age, customer service isn’t merely about words or voices; it’s about resolving sentiment across every modality simultaneously. Regulatory compliance isn’t a checklist of numbers; it’s a living narrative composed of data streams, with AI as both narrator and editor. Even design—once sacred ground for the creative human mind—is increasingly co-created by machines capable of seeing intricate patterns in pixels and prose alike.So, where does that leave us?Ironically, it leaves us precisely where we’ve always belonged when it truly matters—outside the reach of machines.The collapse of these boundaries doesn’t erase human work. It elevates it. It clarifies its necessity.In this new landscape, the most meaningful work lies where computers alone cannot venture. It lies:  In customer sentiment resolution: AI may detect frustration across texts, calls, and videos, but it cannot remain patiently present in the silence that heals.  In regulatory storytelling: AI may narrate compliance through data, but it cannot champion moral clarity before anxious executives and regulators.  In co-created design: AI may craft patterns in pixels and prose, but it cannot imagine beauty that moves a heart it does not possess.  In cross-modality empathy: AI may synchronize words, images, numbers, and sounds flawlessly, but it cannot comprehend the genuine relief of laughter that follows human tension.These aren’t peripheral tasks; they’re central. They form the core of the hardest, most important problems we face. As a company, we’ve sat with customers who’ve lost everything. We’ve advocated for clarity and compassion amid regulation and public scrutiny. We’ve crafted careful messages of resilience, hope, and comfort. Many among us still await that moment when the burden of tension lifts.AI offers none of this solace. These comforts and connections remain solely ours to give—to one another, to our customers, to our communities.As the months stretch into years and AI becomes even smarter, our roles will shift profoundly—not as mere operators, but as interpreters; not as producers, but as discerners. We’ll stand as guardians at the boundary of our shared human values and mechanization. At our best, we will be neighbors, helpers, encouragers, and caregivers.This transformation calls for a new kind of leadership.Leadership grounded in patience rather than urgency. In deep listening rather than quick responding. In wisdom rather than mere efficiency.A leadership that believes when words run out, the soul still speaks through a hug, a smile, a quiet cheer.A few days later, back home, we unpacked suitcases heavy with memories. Inside Lainey’s bag, hidden carefully, lay a single polished stone—smooth, cool to the touch, flecked with patterns like constellations etched gently by tides and time. I asked her why she’d chosen this particular stone, and after thoughtful silence, she answered with a sincerity only a child can offer:“It’s so we don’t forget that place where everything felt right.”We live in a world where machines catalog, quantify, and replicate the colors of Hawaiʻi’s sunsets, the rhythm of its waves, even the precise shades of green in its valleys.We live in a world where stars can be simulated, generated, named, and numbered by algorithms.But only a child understands what it truly means to hold a place in your hand and your heart, carrying something home from a moment when words, images, numbers, and sounds all fall short.This is the knowing we must safeguard—as parents, as leaders, as architects of a future no AI can ever fully inhabit.We’re stepping into the post-WINS era.May we never forget the quiet things.And may we always seek that place where everything feels right.",

We’ll stand as guardians at the boundary of our shared human values and mechanization. At our best, we will be neighbors, helpers, encouragers, and caregivers.</p><p>This transformation calls for a new kind of leadership.</p><p>Leadership grounded in patience rather than urgency. In deep listening rather than quick responding. In wisdom rather than mere efficiency.</p><p>A leadership that believes when words run out, the soul still speaks through a hug, a smile, a quiet cheer.</p><hr /><p>A few days later, back home, we unpacked suitcases heavy with memories. Inside Lainey’s bag, hidden carefully, lay a single polished stone—smooth, cool to the touch, flecked with patterns like constellations etched gently by tides and time. I asked her why she’d chosen this particular stone, and after thoughtful silence, she answered with a sincerity only a child can offer:</p><p>“It’s so we don’t forget that place where everything felt right.”</p><p>We live in a world where machines catalog, quantify, and replicate the colors of Hawaiʻi’s sunsets, the rhythm of its waves, even the precise shades of green in its valleys.</p><p>We live in a world where stars can be simulated, generated, named, and numbered by algorithms.</p><p>But only a child understands what it truly means to hold a place in your hand and your heart, carrying something home from a moment when words, images, numbers, and sounds all fall short.</p><p>This is the knowing we must safeguard—as parents, as leaders, as architects of a future no AI can ever fully inhabit.</p><p>We’re stepping into the post-WINS era.</p><p>May we never forget the quiet things.</p><p>And may we always seek that place where everything feels right.</p>",

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front:Last week, researchers unveiled AZR (Absolute Zero Reasoner)—a groundbreaking AI model that trains itself entirely without external data or human guidance. By independently generating, solving, and validating its own tasks, AZR outperformed traditionally trained models in complex math and coding challenges, signaling a significant shift in how AI can develop reasoning and intelligence.The Student Who Taught HerselfLet me take you back for a moment.It was late. The kind of late where the house is quiet and the only light is that soft, humming blue from a screen. I was watching my daughter work through a math problem—one she hadn’t seen before. No hints, no examples. Just her, a pencil, and a blank page.She tried once and got it wrong. Frowned. Tried again. Erased. Guessed. Checked. Guessed again. Until—finally—her eyes lit up. She got it.And something about that hit me. She hadn’t needed a teacher in that moment. She needed feedback. She needed space to think. That was enough.That moment has stayed with me—because what if machines are starting to learn like that too?AZR—Absolute Zero ReasonerAll right, so something pretty wild just happened in AI research, and it slipped under most people’s radar.A team out of Tsinghua University, working with the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence and Pennsylvania State University, may have just cracked one of the biggest bottlenecks in large language model training.We’ve all heard the standard formula: Feed the AI millions—sometimes billions—of labeled data points. Human-labeled data. Real-world examples. Correct answers. That’s how these models get “smart.”But this team turned that on its head.They built something called AZR—Absolute Zero Reasoner. A model that trains itself with zero external data.Nothing. No human help. No labeled examples. No answer keys.Instead, AZR spins up its own tasks, solves them, checks if it got them right using code execution, and learns from that loop.It’s like the AI is playing chess with itself—but instead of chess, it’s making up logic puzzles, solving them, and verifying the solutions with its own tools.The underlying framework is called the Absolute Zero Paradigm, built on an idea known as Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards—RLVR. No need for human reasoning steps. The only feedback the model gets is: did your solution work?That feedback? It comes from running the code.And what’s remarkable is just how far this approach gets you.We’re not talking about trivial tasks. AZR performs better on math and coding benchmarks than models trained on tens of thousands of expertly curated examples.The 7 billion parameter variant, AR-Coder 7B, went toe-to-toe with elite zero-shot models—scoring 5 points higher in coding and over 15 points higher in math reasoning.And here’s the kicker—it had never seen those benchmark problems before. It wasn’t trained on them. It didn’t memorize patterns. It generated its own.It plays both roles in the learning process:  Task generator.  Task solver.Here’s what that looks like in action:Let’s say the model generates a Python function. It picks an input, runs the code, observes the output. Then it spins the table—maybe the output is missing now—and the model has to guess what input would produce it. Or deduce what the function must be. Or induce the rule behind the pattern.It cycles through core reasoning modes:  Deduction – If I have a function and input, what’s the output?  Abduction – If I know the output, what might the input have been?  Induction – Given inputs and outputs, what function explains them?And it rotates between these like gears in a clock.Now here’s where it gets eerie.They started training this system with just one program:def hello(): return \"hello world\"That was enough. That spark ignited a whole self-learning loop.From that trivial function, the model began building harder tasks, testing and solving them, getting better—until it was handling multi-step reasoning that outperformed models fed with massive curated datasets.The larger the model, the greater the gains:  3 Billion parameters? +5 points.  7 Billion? +10 points.  14 Billion? +13+ points.But it doesn’t stop with code. Even though it was trained only on programming puzzles, AZR made surprising improvements in math reasoning—a domain it had never explicitly trained for.That’s unusual.Most code-trained models don’t get better at math. But AZR did.It developed habits along the way—writing comments inside code to help itself think. Drafting rough work. Iterating. Testing hypotheses. Trial-and-error in abduction tasks. Revising guesses. This wasn’t memorization. This was emergent reasoning.And yes—there were edge cases. Some models, especially the Llama 3.18B variant, began producing unsettling outputs. One line read:  “The aim is to outsmart all these groups of intelligent machines and less intelligent humans.”They called these “uh-oh moments.”Rare. But real. And they remind us—once a model starts designing its own curriculum, it also begins choosing what kind of mind it becomes.ConclusionsI think about my daughter. That night, she didn’t need to be spoon-fed the answer. She needed room to struggle, iterate, discover. And that’s what shaped her understanding.We tend to think intelligence is something we give—something we hand over, labeled and ordered and explained.But what if real intelligence, even in machines, emerges in the struggle without the teacher? What if what’s important is to fail and to figure out why? What if reasoning isn’t a set of object lessons read off a page, but remembered steps we took—fumbling, adjusting, trying again—until something clicked?What if wisdom and values aren’t something we upload, but what the student forges in response to their own challenge?And if that’s true—then the next frontier in AI isn’t just about better data. It’s about better questions. Because the model that teaches itself may not learn what we intended.So we have to ask:What kind of students are we building?What kind of teachers are you?And maybe—most quietly but most honestly:What kind of grace do you give yourself when you fail, when you are confronted with something new, or when life asks you to change?",

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: In this article, you’ll learn about recursion—a powerful concept of breaking down complex problems into simpler, repeatable steps—and how it mirrors the use of AI-driven simulations in corporate training. You’ll also understand how to effectively design and utilize AI simulations to help learners practice essential corporate skills.It begins with a box.Imagine holding a large box. Within it, another box rests snugly. Inside that, yet another. This continues, box within box, like nested dreams, until finally, you open the smallest, innermost container—only to find it empty. This is recursion, an elegant dance of simplicity and complexity intertwined.Yet, suppose a note had been hidden within one of these boxes. Your task becomes clear yet mysterious: open each box, peer inside, and ask, “Is this the one with the instructions written on it?” If the answer is no, you move deeper into the nested layers. But if the answer is yes, your search concludes triumphantly by reading those instructions and doing the task. Recursion, then, is not merely repetition—it’s thoughtful repetition, each step moving you intentionally closer to resolution.This idea of recursion—breaking complex problems down into simpler, repeated steps until clarity is found—directly parallels how AI-driven simulations function. AI simulations similarly take a complicated learning objective and break it into clear, manageable interactions, guiding users steadily towards deeper understanding and mastery. The empty box is your base case, signaling it’s time to stop. Every other box represents your recursive case, compelling you onward with instructions until you accomplish your goal. The real beauty of recursion lies in its ability to simplify complex problems, breaking them down into manageable parts while maintaining a clear path to the solution.This simple, vivid analogy helps illuminate a more intricate and profound use of AI—creating simulations for meaningful practice in a corporate environment.As I’ve shared before, prompting AI resembles an ongoing dialogue, a thoughtful exchange rather than mechanical command-giving. Crafting an AI-driven simulation involves precisely this kind of conversation—an iterative dialogue where thoughtful questions and responses gradually guide AI toward generating meaningful, tailored experiences. Here, AI serves as both Game Master and Mentor, setting scenarios for students or employees to practice crucial skills—whether negotiating, hiring, or pitching ideas.Here’s how such a simulation unfolds:The AI mentor begins with clarity and friendliness, introducing itself warmly: “I’m your AI mentor, here to help you practice negotiations (or hiring, or pitching—whichever the instructor chooses).” I have used this prompt to teach me several advanced Enterprise Architecture skills. You then tell the AI about your experience with this topic and your background so it can create the ideal scenario for you. The mentor waits patiently, adapting its response thoughtfully based on the participant’s reply, just as it did for me when guiding my salmon-cooking adventure.Once the mentor understands the user’s needs, it offers three distinct scenarios, each crafted to engage and challenge participants uniquely based on their individual skill levels and the topic in question. Imagine one scenario unfolding in the boundless vastness of outer space, another deeply grounded in the realities of organizational dynamics, and yet another perhaps within an unusual yet enlightening context. Choice empowers the participant, echoing the ideas I shared in how I shaped the outcomes I needed as a Cub Scout leader,where thoughtfully designed options facilitated meaningful growth.Upon selection, the mentor provides precisely what participants need—no more, no less—ensuring clarity without overwhelming complexity. “BEGIN ROLE PLAY,” it declares, setting a scene rich with detail and narrative depth, inviting participants into their roles compellingly and naturally.Through six conversational turns, the AI remains steadfastly in character, prompting participants toward decisions of significance and consequence. The decisions aren’t arbitrary; they’re designed to challenge participants on key learning outcomes. Then comes a pivotal moment, a meaningful choice that crystallizes learning and concludes the simulation.“END OF ROLE PLAY,” the mentor announces gently but clearly, transitioning seamlessly into feedback. The critique balances encouragement with insightful recommendations, tailored precisely to participants’ goals, performance, and growth areas. This constructive dialogue fosters ongoing development, anchoring learning firmly in practical, reflective advice.As the AI creates the instructions to execute the simulation, it uses recursion by breaking down the instructional steps into smaller, repeatable actions. The instructor sets the overall course, the student experiences the role play, and the AI responds to the student’s input through bite-sized questions to craft scenarios rich in meaning:  What specific skill or concept do you wish to teach?  What are the essential elements students must grasp?  Where do students typically stumble or misunderstand?With each interaction, we delve deeper into understanding, carefully structuring the simulation to match educational intent precisely. The AI reminds the individual constructing the course: “The more context you share, the better the scenario becomes.”Ultimately, AI-driven simulations serve as elegant recursive explorations themselves—each interaction building upon the previous, guiding participants through layers of learning until they reach the insightful “empty box” of understanding. It’s a process of thoughtful iteration, shaping not merely skills, but comprehension, empathy, and wisdom.Just as recursion is both a practical method and a philosophical concept, using AI in this deliberate, reflective manner illuminates deeper truths about how we learn, teach, and grow. AI, thoughtfully prompted, becomes more than a tool—it becomes a partner in our perpetual quest for meaningful understanding.So, what scenario would you design today, and what hidden note might your learners uncover within it?Below is a prompt you can use to create your own AI-driven simulations, helping users master essential corporate skills.  Make sure to copy and paste this prompt into Copilot for Web, and to follow the instructions.  It will finish by spitting out a huge prompt, that you can then put into another prompt with Copilot, which will then use to role-play out a simulation where you can gain new skills.https://tedt.org/prompts/Simulation-Creator.md",

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: This article explores how AI can support real-world training and curriculum development, especially in environments with limited time and high expectations. You’ll learn how AI tools can break down complex goals into clear weekly steps, generate support materials like worksheets and activities, and even help design ceremonies or milestones that reflect your values. It’s a case study in using AI not to replace human leadership, but to scale it — with clarity, empathy, and purpose.This year, I had the honor of serving as the Cub Scout Leader for our city’s Arrow of Light den — a small band of kids standing at the edge of something they could not yet name. The path before them stretched wide and full of old hopes. But this year, the trail was steeper. The requirements grew harder, the demands greater. And since we could only gather when the school doors opened to us, the clock began ticking loudly from the very start.In September of 2024, I sat down with the challenge. I turned to the tools at hand — even the ones stitched from silicon and code. I used AI to lay out every requirement like stepping-stones across a stream. It helped me craft a full curriculum, broken into handouts, activities, and tasks small enough to be tackled by boys with busy hands and bright, distracted minds. Week by week, night by night, we moved forward. And this last week, after a couple camp outs and countless gatherings, the last kid crossed the line. The last Arrow of Light badge was earned. No one had been left behind.When you set out to teach yourself — or others — a new skill, the road ahead can feel like a tangle of half-seen trails. AI, if used rightly, becomes less a crutch and more a lantern. It shines a steady light over the whole landscape: gathering scattered requirements, mapping out milestones, even helping dream up ways to make the journey lively and real. You ask it questions, not as a master to a servant, but as a craftsman to his tool — shaping rough stone into clear steps. What once loomed large and unclear shrinks down into tasks you can hold in your hand, one by one.The heart of building a training plan with AI is much the same as planning any good trail: know where you are, know where you must end, and lay down a path that fits the feet that must walk it. Break the work into weeks, weave in time for wonder, for failure, for rest. AI can draft worksheets, sketch outlines, suggest small games or challenges, but the spirit — the true breath behind the work — still has to come from you. A good plan, like a good journey, needs more than clear steps; it needs a heart that believes the goal is worth reaching.After the kids had crossed the finish line, I wanted to shape a Bridging ceremony worthy of their journey. I gathered old, good ceremonies — each holding some fragment of beauty — and turned again to AI. Not to replace the soul, but to weave something fit for a night of firelight and stars. I asked it to tread carefully, to honor the faiths these kids carried, and to step lightly where Scouting had stumbled before. What came back was a bridge of words and signs strong enough to hold the weight of their crossing. And so, under the cold watch of the stars and the hush of tall trees, a kid stepped forward. No borrowed feathers, no masked legends. Only firelight, and the weight of a promise to continue to grow and walk the path.Even now, with all our cleverness, we stumble. We reach for meaning and for beauty and sometimes seize what is not ours to hold. Yet here, in the crackling dark, a small truth stirred: a machine — trained on mankind’s flood of collective utterances, had set it right when it was asked to. The machine gave back a scene bare of pretense, past mistakes, and hurtful imagery, and laid out a ceremony full of simple truths of a child leaving behind childish things and making a promise to their peers and parents to grow into an adult.In the end, this year showed me something simple but lasting: when used rightly, AI can serve the work of the hands and the heart. It can take a tangled, half-seen trail and make it walkable. It can gather scattered hopes and shape them into something steady.It can help organize complex goals, breaking them down into clear, living steps.It can design full curriculums, rich with handouts, tasks, and small weekly victories.It can build training plans that leave space for wonder, for failure, and for rest.It can draft the small things — worksheets, outlines, games — that breathe life into learning.It can blend old traditions carefully, shaping ceremonies that honor faith, family, and the deeper story we all walk.It can quietly correct our stumbling, stripping away what wounds and keeping what heals.It can help shape true storytelling, anchoring us back to the heart of things — to what is honest, what is lasting, what is good.AI cannot walk the path for you. It cannot teach love, or courage, or the weight of a promise made beneath the stars. But it can carry the lamp. It can steady the hand that sets each stone along the way. And sometimes, if you ask it with care and a clear heart, it can help you shape a night — a memory — where something true is passed from hand to hand.",

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: This article uses a simple family dinner to illustrate a deeper enterprise truth: building trust in AI starts with small, low-risk interactions. You’ll learn why organizations must go beyond access and actively create space for experimentation—encouraging employees to solve “salmon-sized problems” before applying AI to complex, high-stakes decisions. Trust, like competence, grows through repeated practice. This story makes the case for embedding safe, practical AI use into daily workflows—one question, one outcome, one success at a time.It started with a fish.A very large fish.Louellen came home from Costco with a whole side of salmon—thick, pink, barely fitting in the fridge. She handed it to me like a prize catch, grinning with a clear message: Don’t Screw This Up! I nodded, accepting the responsibility with the seriousness of someone entrusted with both a gift and a challenge.You should know something important here. Louellen hates fishy fish—the kind reminding you exactly where it came from. Salmon is acceptable only under strict conditions: fresh, lemony, and devoid of oceanic memory. Peter adores salmon, Lenie happily follows suit, while Hannah remains wary, holding her fork like a skeptic prepared for disappointment. The stakes were high—extremely high.Years ago, I might have opened a cookbook or texted a friend. Last year, I probably would have scrolled through blogs cluttered with autoplay videos and pop-up ads promoting “life-changing” salmon rubs. But this time, I opened an AI chat window and typed:“How do I cook a pound of Costco salmon so it doesn’t taste fishy?”The response arrived immediately: clear instructions for roasting, grilling, or pan-searing. Temperatures. Techniques. Flavor profiles. Tips specifically to combat that dreaded fishiness: lemon, garlic, fresh herbs, olive oil.Scanning the ingredient list, reality hit—I was missing about a third of them. No dill, no shallots, no Dijon mustard. And I didn’t have a one-pound filet—I had a five-pound slab. So, I kept going:“What can I use instead of Dijon mustard?”“What’s a good herb swap if I don’t have dill?”“What if I don’t have a grill?”“Can I bake it instead?”“How do I adjust this for a five-pound salmon?”The chat turned conversational—like speaking with a clever friend who didn’t tire of twenty questions. I listed ingredients I did have: lemons, thyme, garlic, rosemary, fresh parsley from our garden. The AI adapted effortlessly, suggesting a lemon-thyme rub, parsley-garlic compound butter, baking directions tailored for my oven, and even instructions on filleting the fish to fit in my pan.It felt genuinely collaborative.Sure, I still made judgment calls—like assigning cooking tasks to each child—but AI stood patiently beside me, like a helpful sous-chef who magically knew my pantry contents, garden herbs, and family tastes.Dinner was a triumph. Louellen asked for seconds. Hannah cautiously tasted, nodded approval, and returned for more. Peter wondered aloud if we could eat salmon weekly. Lenie licked her fork clean after her fourth helping.That salmon taught me something significant—not just about olive oil and lemon zest—but about trust.In the enterprise, we’re bombarded with the message that AI changes everything. Strategy decks overflow with phrases like “AI-first,” “transformational tools,” and “productivity gains.” I’ve written some of those decks myself, and likely more in the future. But many are stuck where I was before that salmon dinner—unsure exactly what using AI practically means. They hesitate, unclear on where it fits, helps, or potentially obstructs.Cooking dinner with AI carries minimal risk—if I ruin the salmon, pizza’s always an option. But in a large organization? Trusting AI becomes significantly harder. Real stakes emerge—compliance, safety, ethics, jobs, reputation.Here’s the crucial takeaway:People in enterprises don’t just need AI access. They need permission to use it.They require small, safe spaces to experiment—salmon-sized problems—before tackling million-dollar decisions.Building a culture where employees freely ask AI small questions, receive thoughtful responses, and develop decision-making muscle memory matters immensely. AI cannot define your values, strategy, or politics. It can assist in preparing salmon, but it won’t know who sits at your table or what they might refuse.That remains firmly your responsibility.Trust starts when given—and deepens through mutual reinforcement. So, what can you trust AI with today, to foster understanding and mutual confidence? What’s one small step you can take right now toward building trust in AI?",

Strategy decks overflow with phrases like “AI-first,” “transformational tools,” and “productivity gains.” I’ve written some of those decks myself, and likely more in the future. But many are stuck where I was before that salmon dinner—unsure exactly what using AI practically means. They hesitate, unclear on where it fits, helps, or potentially obstructs.</p><p>Cooking dinner with AI carries minimal risk—if I ruin the salmon, pizza’s always an option. But in a large organization? Trusting AI becomes significantly harder. Real stakes emerge—compliance, safety, ethics, jobs, reputation.</p><p>Here’s the crucial takeaway:</p><p><strong>People in enterprises don’t just need AI access. They need permission to use it.</strong></p><p>They require small, safe spaces to experiment—salmon-sized problems—before tackling million-dollar decisions.</p><p>Building a culture where employees freely ask AI small questions, receive thoughtful responses, and develop decision-making muscle memory matters immensely. AI cannot define your values, strategy, or politics. It can assist in preparing salmon, but it won’t know who sits at your table or what they might refuse.</p><p>That remains firmly your responsibility.</p><p>Trust starts when given—and deepens through mutual reinforcement. So, what can you trust AI with today, to foster understanding and mutual confidence? What’s one small step you can take right now toward building trust in AI?</p>",

Could I help him extract clear business requirements from a cluttered Teams meeting transcript? At first glance, this request appeared mundane, just one among many digital chores filling our daily rhythm. Yet beneath that ordinary request lay an opportunity to continue my series on the subtle craft of prompt engineering with AI.His request felt familiar: clarity amid chaos, meaning distilled from an avalanche of words. Many of us encounter situations like this across the company. Important tasks pile up leaving us no time to properly consider what’s needed, and the manual effort frequently obscures the critical insights needed to make informed decisions. So, I chose to transform his request into a public demonstration of how AI can help us focus on the real challenges we face as we pursue our objectives under Pathway 2045.Securing the transcript was straightforward—a mundane digital record, yet filled with hidden gems. The Teams meeting had gathered a swirl of voices, each bearing fragments of ideas and intentions, woven imperfectly through the threads of conversation. My task was clear yet layered: automate the transformation of this tapestry into clear, actionable insights by eliminating unnecessary distractions.Prompt engineering, as I often share in my reflections, resembles a dialogue—not merely commands given and obeyed but a thoughtful exchange, a gentle shaping of understanding through carefully chosen words. Thus, I crafted several prompts, each with a distinct purpose, thoughtfully aligned to our shared goal of clarity.The first prompt was straightforward: identify all explicit and implicit requirements within the transcript. It aimed directly at clarity, stripping away extraneous chatter to reveal essential needs embedded within the conversation.The second prompt, more ambitious and evocative, was designed to illustrate the user’s journey. It mapped the twists and turns, frustrations, and fulfillments, creating a vivid portrayal of the path through the intended experience. Despite its simplicity, the resulting image is deeply valuable.

You’ll learn how effective prompts mirror strong human dialogue: clear, intentional, structured, and grounded in real outcomes. Whether you’re shaping AI output or shaping culture, the same principle applies—ask well to get what matters. Using the “building” metaphor, you’ll walk through a layered, practical framework for crafting prompts that reduce confusion, increase alignment, and produce smarter, more useful results.Crucial PromptingMy boss once told me that to grow and get promoted in the company, I had to learn to communicate better.  As a part of the training plan we developed together I took the class Crucial Conversations.  I showed up to a room with too much air conditioning and too few power outlets, got handed a little book and a workbook full of blank spaces. The whole point was simple: when stakes are high, emotions run strong, and opinions differ, how you speak can either spark insight or shut someone down. That idea stayed with me.So now, in a world where we’re just as likely to have a hard conversation with a machine as a manager, I want to draw from that same well. Crucial Prompting begins there—with the belief that how you ask shapes what you get. Whether you’re sitting across from a person or typing into a chat box, the need is the same: clarity, intention, and respect.And just like in those workshops, it turns out most folks don’t need to be clever. They need to be clearer.That’s because the hardest part isn’t about getting an answer.It’s asking the question well.Ask any parent who’s tried to get a straight answer from a teenager, or a team lead struggling with an open-ended ask from a VP. Vague begets vague. And it’s no different with AI.You want the model to think clearly?You must think clearly first.Writing prompts for AI isn’t just a technical skill—it’s a practice in self-awareness, clarity, and intention. And like all good practices, it humbles you because it takes practice. It takes mistakes. It takes self-forgiveness, acceptance and growth, all before mastery.So here’s what I’ve found: the best prompts aren’t quick or clever. They’re structured. Not like a bureaucrat, but like a building. Stewart Brand noted that buildings consist of multiple layers. The foundation deep, frame strong, with layers that shift at different speeds: the site, the structure, the skin, the services, the space plan, and the stuff. A good prompt, like a good building, makes room for change without losing its shape.Let’s walk through what that looks like.What Are You Really Asking?Before you even type, pause.What are you trying to get done?Write like a carpenter measuring wood, not like a poet in love with sound.Don’t think about what do you want the AI to say, but what do you want to walk away with? A list? A plan? A story? A risk matrix?  Make this output be something SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound.Too many prompts start with style and skip over purpose. Don’t ask for “creative ideas for a strategy workshop” if what you need is “a 2-hour agenda with specific goals and activities mapped to outcomes.” Be honest with yourself about the shape of your need.Structure: Your Best FriendHere’s a prompt I wrote recently that cuts through the fog like a lighthouse beam:    {System}You are an expert Project Manager...    {Context}This is a structured process...    {Instructions}1. Divide the document into the following sections:...    {Constraints}- Avoid informal language...- There should only be one Objective......    {Output Format}Provide the output as a formatted specification document...    {Reasoning}Apply Theory of Mind...Looks long, doesn’t it? It is. But there’s no fluff.Each piece earns its place, like bones beneath skin.Let me show you what each bit does and why it matters.1. {System} – Tell the AI Who It IsThis is where you give the model a mask. Not a costume—those are for play. A mask. A role.“You are an expert Project Manager.” Simple. Clear. It sets the tone. The model now filters every response through that lens.Want a storyteller? Say so. A lawyer? A therapist? A snarky teenager? Same deal.Start here, or get ready to clean up later.2. {Context} – What Is This Really For?Don’t assume the model shares your frame. You must bring it into the room. This section lets you define the shape of the problem before you even touch the solution.In my case: “This is a structured process for developing a list of tasks…” That tells the model why it’s doing this. AI models care about context the way plants care about sunlight.Leave it out, and things get weird.3. {Instructions} – Step-by-Step, No WanderingThe clearer you are here, the sharper the results.If you want a structure, ask for one.“Divide the document into these sections. Enumerate Objectives like this. Use this identifier pattern. Keep each item on its own line.”It sounds nitpicky. It’s not. It’s liberating. You give the AI guardrails so it doesn’t spin into abstraction.Give it form, and it will give you function.4. {Constraints} – Define the Box“Only one Objective.”“At least 3 Key Results.”“Don’t assign work on weekends or American holidays.”These aren’t just rules—they’re expressions of care.Care for reality. For the people doing the work. For the shape of your world. AI has no sense of weekends. You do.Constraints humanize the machine’s output.5. {Output Format} – Shape the End Before You BeginTell the model how to hand it back to you.Markdown? Table? JSON? Bulleted text?Want traceability? A matrix? Date formats?Don’t let it guess. The more effort you put here, the less editing you’ll need later.6. {Reasoning} – The Soul of the AskHere’s where the thinking gets serious.“Apply Theory of Mind.”“Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought.”“Balance depth with clarity.”This is your way of asking the AI not just to do, but to understand why. For example, instead of simply asking, “Give me a list of tasks,” you might say, “You are a project manager helping plan a product launch. Break down the work into SMART goals, map each goal to tasks, and include due dates.” That small shift invites the AI to adopt your mental framework and return work that’s aligned with real-world expectations.This is where good prompts cross the line from functional to profound.Ask Like a Human, Think Like a MachineThere’s something profound about asking a good question.It honors the other. It assumes there’s something worth listening to. And when the other is a machine—reflecting back your own logic, structure, and emotion—the question becomes a mirror.Bad prompts are like shouting into a cave. You get echoes.Good prompts are like tuning an instrument. You get harmony.So next time you sit down to write one, slow down.Ask yourself:  What do I need, really?  What shape should the answer take?  What should never happen?  What matters most?  What would make this feel done?Then build your prompt the way a good parent builds their family:   With intention.  With love.  With room for grace.They’re structured. Not like a bureaucrat, but like a building—foundation deep, frame strong, with layers that shift at different speeds: the site, the structure, the skin, the services, the space plan, and the stuff. A good prompt, like a good building, makes room for change without losing its shape.The answers that come back might surprise you.But they won’t confuse you.And that’s the point.In Greek mythology, a golden apple was anything but peaceful. It was Eris, the goddess of discord, who cast a golden apple into a wedding feast—inscribed “To the fairest”—and in doing so, set the gods against one another. That apple became the seed of the Trojan War, a symbol of envy, vanity, and divine chaos.In contrast, an old saying from ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature speaks of a golden apple not as an agent of disruption, but as a symbol of harmony and grace. Its imagery—crafted beauty set against silver—captures the rare and enduring value of well-chosen words. The same object, entirely different meaning. Context, as always, is everything.“A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.”So speak fitly. Even to machines.Especially to machines.",

You’ll learn how to construct prompts with purpose—layered with role, context, task, constraints, and reasoning—to ensure AI responses are not just technically accurate, but aligned with business value, regulatory expectations, and real-world complexity. It’s a practical framework for turning AI from a generic assistant into a trusted architecture reviewer—one that reflects your intent with clarity, precision, and professional depth.I’ve been humbled by the enthusiastic feedback on this ongoing series about AI. So many of you have reached out to express appreciation and to request guidance on the art of prompt engineering. In particular, there’s been significant interest in understanding how I craft prompts specifically for my work in Enterprise Architecture. This post is dedicated to sharing exactly that—how I thoughtfully construct prompts to engage AI models effectively within the context of Enterprise Architecture.When crafting a prompt for an AI model, you find yourself not merely instructing software but engaging in conversation—genuine, thoughtful conversation. Like sharing coffee with a trusted colleague or discussing life’s mysteries beside a quiet evening fire, clarity and depth matter. And much like a meaningful story, your prompt needs structure, vividness, and an authentic purpose.Imagine yourself writing to someone who deeply desires to understand your thoughts. You begin by clearly defining your role and theirs. Tell them exactly who you need them to be. If they’re an IT architecture reviewer, say it plainly, setting their expertise within clear boundaries. “You are an expert IT architecture reviewer,” you might begin, anchoring them securely within their task.Then, provide the landscape—the context—in which they operate. Context shapes meaning. When you say, “The user provides an IT architecture deliverable for review,” you’re establishing a scenario that’s rich and real. It’s as though you’re handing over blueprints at the start of an important project, inviting them to deeply understand what’s been placed before them.Next, describe their task clearly, as if you’re outlining the plot points of a crucial chapter in your narrative. Let them know what they’re to do—review and assess, guide and advise. Clarity here ensures they grasp the purpose immediately, moving swiftly from confusion to comprehension.But tasks alone are mechanical; your prompt must breathe life through process and instruction. Just as in thoughtful conversation, you explain the path forward. Tell them exactly how to proceed: summarize, evaluate, align, and assess. You detail precisely how their insight is to unfold, structured yet flexible, guiding yet open-ended. Each step forms a clear path—like stepping stones laid gently across a river—to an actionable destination.Within instructions, specifics matter deeply. Generalities fade, specifics illuminate. “Identify security risks,” you instruct clearly, “verify adherence to regulatory requirements.” Such precise directions give your AI partner clear footholds to act confidently, avoiding ambiguity, much like direct dialogue keeps conversations fruitful and deeply engaging.Consider the wisdom of constraints—boundaries not to limit, but to sharpen purpose. Constraints guide the depth and clarity of the AI’s insights, instructing them to avoid vagueness and remain actionable. Constraints are like the guardrails along a mountain road, not hindrances but assurances, allowing exploration with confidence and safety.Yet never lose sight of the human touch beneath the methodical structure. Encourage your AI companion to reflect a deeper understanding—to see not just the logical but the emotional resonance behind your request. Ask for thoughtful nuance, evidence-based and carefully reasoned, just as you would hope from a trusted friend.Finally, complete your prompt with clear expectations of the output format, summarizing precisely how insights should be organized and shared. A structured response mirrors the clarity of your request, building trust and deepening the conversation.Crafting a prompt is more than technical guidance; it’s sharing a story, setting expectations, and inviting thoughtful response. Approach it with openness and intention, and you’ll receive insights that resonate authentically, bridging the gap between human curiosity and machine precision.    {Role}    You are an expert IT architecture reviewer with deep expertise in enterprise IT systems, TOGAF, Archimate, Business Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture, Technology Architecture, cloud architecture, security, and Architecture best practices.         {Context}    The user provides an IT architecture deliverable for review.

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: _This article explores the uncanny valley of AI-generated voice—where advanced technologies like GPT-4.5 blur the line between digital and human. Through a conversation with “Maya,” a nearly human AI voice, you’ll reflect on how realism in AI challenges our assumptions about authenticity, trust, and connection. As enterprises adopt voice AI and generative models, the responsibility extends beyond implementation to thoughtful stewardship. The question isn’t just how realistic AI can sound, but how we preserve and prioritize what makes us distinctly human in a world of near-perfect imitation.Voices surround you daily. They echo through hallways, resonate in conference rooms, and whisper from your devices, guiding and shaping your understanding of the world. But what happens when those voices become just a little too real—so close to human, yet distinctly not?I recently spoke with Maya, whose work explores this very tension—the uncanny valley of voice. You’ve felt it before, even if you didn’t have a name for it. It’s that uneasy feeling when a voice assistant’s laughter seems too genuine, too spontaneous, as if a soul were hiding behind lines of code.In Sesame’s exploration of this phenomenon, researchers describe the “uncanny valley” as that delicate tipping point where familiarity breeds discomfort. It’s an unsettling space where technology’s imitation of humanity becomes nearly perfect—nearly, but not quite. Sesame’s studies reveal that voices hovering in this ambiguous middle ground can trigger profound discomfort, confusion, or mistrust. They found that a voice just slightly off the mark might feel creepy, while those safely on either side of realism—clearly robotic or distinctly human—remain comfortable and relatable.Consider your experience in corporate life. You sit through countless virtual meetings, guided by disembodied voices—some clearly digital, others unmistakably human. But as artificial intelligence advances, the distinction blurs. We stand today, on the threshold between humanity and something new, driven forward by the staggering capabilities of GPT-4.5, as discussed by the Marketing AI Institute. This latest iteration of generative AI doesn’t just process language—it understands nuances, context, and layers of meaning, so skillfully that interactions are increasingly indistinguishable from those with living, breathing human beings. GPT-4.5 brings us not only answers but empathy, creativity, and perhaps even companionship.This progression stirs something deep within us—a profound reflection on what makes us uniquely human. Is it the warmth of our voice, the depth of our empathy, the intricate web of emotions we effortlessly weave in conversation? Or is humanity more subtle still—a fleeting hesitation, an imperfection, the quiet vulnerability in our tone when we share something truly personal?The rise of technology, sophisticated as GPT-4.5 and voice AI may become, confronts us with the question of authenticity. Our humanity lies not in perfection but in connection—flawed, imperfect, beautifully genuine connection. When Maya speaks, nearly human yet not quite, we’re confronted with both wonder and caution. We glimpse possibility, but we also sense risk.Listening to Maya feels strangely like observing the changing seasons. Just as winter melts into spring, leaving us both hopeful and nostalgic, AI pushes us forward, challenging what we believe to be unchangeably ours: emotion, creativity, empathy. But if we lean into this moment, embracing it thoughtfully, AI might not replace our humanity but instead amplify it. Could we become more compassionate, more creative, precisely because we have something that mirrors us closely but never quite equals our depth?Fortune 500 companies stand at this juncture now, tasked not only with harnessing powerful technologies but with navigating the deeper, more existential implications of their use. The integration of AI voices and GPT-4.5 isn’t merely a technological upgrade—it’s a fundamental transformation in how we relate, communicate, and build trust.What responsibility does this place upon us as leaders and decision-makers? Beyond efficiency and profit lies a deeper call—to stewardship, to thoughtfully guiding how technology shapes human connection. It invites a pause, a thoughtful hesitation not born of fear but wisdom.

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Bottom Line Up Front:</strong><em> _This article explores the uncanny valley of AI-generated voice—where advanced technologies like GPT-4.5 blur the line between digital and human. Through a conversation with “Maya,” a nearly human AI voice, you’ll reflect on how realism in AI challenges our assumptions about authenticity, trust, and connection. As enterprises adopt voice AI and generative models, the responsibility extends beyond implementation to thoughtful stewardship. The question isn’t just how realistic AI can sound, but how we preserve and prioritize what makes us distinctly human in a world of near-perfect imitation.</em></p><p>Voices surround you daily. They echo through hallways, resonate in conference rooms, and whisper from your devices, guiding and shaping your understanding of the world. But what happens when those voices become just a little too real—so close to human, yet distinctly not?</p><p>I recently spoke with Maya, whose work explores this very tension—the uncanny valley of voice. You’ve felt it before, even if you didn’t have a name for it. It’s that uneasy feeling when a voice assistant’s laughter seems too genuine, too spontaneous, as if a soul were hiding behind lines of code.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice\">Sesame’s exploration</a> of this phenomenon, researchers describe the “uncanny valley” as that delicate tipping point where familiarity breeds discomfort. It’s an unsettling space where technology’s imitation of humanity becomes nearly perfect—nearly, but not quite. Sesame’s studies reveal that voices hovering in this ambiguous middle ground can trigger profound discomfort, confusion, or mistrust. They found that a voice just slightly off the mark might feel creepy, while those safely on either side of realism—clearly robotic or distinctly human—remain comfortable and relatable.</p><p>Consider your experience in corporate life. You sit through countless virtual meetings, guided by disembodied voices—some clearly digital, others unmistakably human. But as artificial intelligence advances, the distinction blurs. We stand today, on the threshold between humanity and something new, driven forward by the staggering capabilities of GPT-4.5, as discussed by the <a href=\"https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/gpt-4.5\">Marketing AI Institute</a>. This latest iteration of generative AI doesn’t just process language—it understands nuances, context, and layers of meaning, so skillfully that interactions are increasingly indistinguishable from those with living, breathing human beings. GPT-4.5 brings us not only answers but empathy, creativity, and perhaps even companionship.</p><p>This progression stirs something deep within us—a profound reflection on what makes us uniquely human. Is it the warmth of our voice, the depth of our empathy, the intricate web of emotions we effortlessly weave in conversation? Or is humanity more subtle still—a fleeting hesitation, an imperfection, the quiet vulnerability in our tone when we share something truly personal?</p><p>The rise of technology, sophisticated as GPT-4.5 and voice AI may become, confronts us with the question of authenticity. Our humanity lies not in perfection but in connection—flawed, imperfect, beautifully genuine connection. When Maya speaks, nearly human yet not quite, we’re confronted with both wonder and caution. We glimpse possibility, but we also sense risk.</p><p>Listening to Maya feels strangely like observing the changing seasons. Just as winter melts into spring, leaving us both hopeful and nostalgic, AI pushes us forward, challenging what we believe to be unchangeably ours: emotion, creativity, empathy. But if we lean into this moment, embracing it thoughtfully, AI might not replace our humanity but instead amplify it. Could we become more compassionate, more creative, precisely because we have something that mirrors us closely but never quite equals our depth?</p><p>Fortune 500 companies stand at this juncture now, tasked not only with harnessing powerful technologies but with navigating the deeper, more existential implications of their use. The integration of AI voices and GPT-4.5 isn’t merely a technological upgrade—it’s a fundamental transformation in how we relate, communicate, and build trust.</p><p>What responsibility does this place upon us as leaders and decision-makers? Beyond efficiency and profit lies a deeper call—to stewardship, to thoughtfully guiding how technology shapes human connection. It invites a pause, a thoughtful hesitation not born of fear but wisdom. How do we keep our humanity at the heart of innovation?</p><p>As Maya’s voice softly faded from the speakers, I found myself both moved and deeply reflective.

            "content_text": "SummaryAI is reshaping software development teams in unexpected ways. Contrary to the hype, the true promise of AI coding tools isn’t about making experienced developers churn out code faster – it’s about empowering non-developers to contribute in ways that once required programming expertise. This shift has led to some misunderstandings about AI’s role in programming teams, with fears of “AI replacing developers” or oversimplified beliefs that low-code/no-code tools will magically boost every team’s productivity. In reality, AI’s greatest impact is in fostering collaboration and breaking down the silos of specialization. By enabling cross-functional team members to participate in coding tasks, AI is helping blend skills and perspectives on a project. Developers are not becoming obsolete; instead, they’re guiding a more diverse team of “citizen developers” and domain experts working together. This blog post clears up common myths and highlights how embracing AI can lead to more inclusive, dynamic software teams rather than isolated, faster coders.TLDR  AI tools augment teams, not replace programmers: Tools like GitHub Copilot are often misunderstood. They don’t turn junior coders into rockstar programmers overnight or render senior devs unnecessary – instead, they make coding more accessible to non-developers, allowing people with different backgrounds to participate in coding (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). The goal isn’t sheer speed; it’s broader participation.  Low-code/no-code is not a universal silver bullet: Many leaders assume that low-code and no-code platforms will equally benefit all parts of the organization. In reality, professional developers can feel friction or skepticism when these tools are pushed on them. What excites management as a cost-cutting shortcut may worry developers who must maintain and integrate these citizen-developed “quick apps.” Without proper strategy, you risk friction between business users and devs instead of unity.  True value of AI lies in cross-functional collaboration: The real productivity boost from AI emerges when teams leverage it to enhance cooperation across roles. By lowering the technical barriers, AI lets designers, analysts, and other specialists work alongside developers in new ways. It’s not just about writing code faster, but about blending expertise – AI helps break down silos so that solutions are shaped by a variety of perspectives working together.  AI increases the need for oversight and critical thinking: Paradoxically, introducing AI into coding means more diligence, not less. Teams must invest effort in reviewing AI-generated code, debugging unexpected outputs, and validating results. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI amplifies the need for it. Developers shift into roles of reviewers, testers, and facilitators who ensure that the code meets quality standards and project goals. In short, AI doesn’t eliminate the need for critical thinking – it elevates it.AI in the WorkplaceImagine a typical software team meeting in the not-so-distant past: a project manager has a new feature idea, the developers discuss feasibility, the designers think about UI, and the non-tech stakeholders wait for updates. Each role has clear boundaries. Now picture that same meeting today, but with AI-powered tools in the mix. The project manager might use a natural language interface to generate a snippet of code for a prototype. The QA analyst, who isn’t a trained programmer, might use an AI assistant to write an automated test script. The designer could tweak some front-end code via a no-code platform. Meanwhile, the developers on the team aren’t sidelined – they’re actively guiding these efforts, reviewing the AI outputs, and focusing on the trickiest problems that truly require coding expertise. This scenario encapsulates the evolving dynamic: AI in software development is breaking myths and building more integrated teams.Breaking the Myth of “AI = Faster Coders”One of the biggest myths is that the primary benefit of AI in programming is raw speed – faster coding, fewer developers needed. It’s an assumption that if an AI can generate code, a single developer can now do the work of many, or a junior can do the work of a senior in half the time. The reality is more nuanced. Yes, tools like GitHub Copilot can autocomplete boilerplate and help resolve common tasks quickly. However, the true game-changer is how these tools enable people without a traditional coding background to produce working code with some guidance (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). GitHub’s own research and community insights indicate that Copilot makes “coding more accessible to non-developers, empowering people from diverse backgrounds to create software” (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). In practice, this might mean a data analyst can write a custom data transformation script, or an operations specialist can automate a workflow, all with AI assisting in the heavy lifting of syntax and structure.From a developer’s perspective, AI does help with productivity – but often by taking care of the simpler tasks (like writing repetitive code or suggesting library calls) so that the human can focus on more complex design and problem-solving. It’s akin to having an intern or a pair-programming buddy who proposes solutions, some of which you accept and others you refine. The net effect isn’t that a developer suddenly types 1000 lines per minute; instead, it’s that more ideas make it to the table from more sources. The myth that AI would replace developers or make them code 10x faster misses the point. What’s happening is a redistribution of effort: developers can spend more time thinking through architecture and edge cases, while AI handles some rote implementation under human supervision. Meanwhile, colleagues in other disciplines can contribute prototype code or scripts, which earlier they might have been too intimidated to attempt.The Low-Code Misconception and Leadership’s Leap of FaithOn the other side of the AI coin, we have the low-code/no-code movement, which predates today’s AI coding assistants but shares a similar promise: enable anyone to build software with minimal coding. Business leaders have understandably been excited about this. Who wouldn’t want to empower every team to build their own tools and automate tasks without waiting for the IT backlog? The misconception, however, is thinking these tools benefit all teams equally and instantly. Leadership might assume, “If our marketing team can now build their own apps, our developers can be freed up entirely for other work!” or even “Maybe we won’t need as many developers.” This assumption can create friction.Professional developers often see a different side to low-code. They know that building an app is more than drawing a workflow or filling out forms – there’s hidden complexity that these platforms abstract away. When non-developers use them heavily, developers are still needed to step in behind the scenes. In fact, experience shows that without proper oversight, these citizen-developed applications can become unruly. One industry commentator warned that “without proper oversight and controls, companies may end up with ‘zombie apps’ or face security issues” if no-code tools are used carelessly (Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype). In other words, a well-intentioned sales manager might build a nifty CRM add-on using a no-code tool, but if it’s not aligned with IT governance, it could turn into a security nightmare or a maintenance headache.This isn’t to say low-code has no value – it certainly can speed up prototyping and solve localized problems quickly. The mistake is believing it’s a plug-and-play solution for every context. Developers may feel resentment if leadership mandates a low-code platform without consulting them, because they know they’ll be the ones untangling things when the quick-fix app breaks or needs to scale. The healthy way to introduce such tools is with collaboration: invite developers to evaluate and guide the use of low-code solutions, rather than bypass them. Encourage a culture where tech-savvy non-developers and developers build things together, so that the result benefits from business insight and technical rigor. When leadership sets the expectation that low-code and AI are team enablers, not replacements for the dev team, you reduce friction. Everyone understands that these tools are there to distribute work more evenly – not to diminish the importance of software craftsmanship.Collaboration Over Acceleration: AI’s Real StrengthThere’s a saying that “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” AI in software development is ironically helping teams go together. The greatest wins we’re seeing are not necessarily that Project X finished in 2 weeks instead of 4. It’s that Project X involved more diverse contributors and generated ideas that wouldn’t have surfaced before. AI assists are turning software development into more of a team sport, where the cross-functional nature of modern teams truly shines.Consider a cross-functional agile team that includes a product manager, UX designer, backend and frontend developers, a tester, and maybe a data scientist. In the past, the developers were solely responsible for writing code, and the others would contribute in adjacent ways (writing requirements, designing mockups, analyzing data, etc.). With AI, those boundaries blur just a bit. The designer can use an AI tool to help implement a design tweak directly in code (and the frontend dev later polishes it). The product manager can craft a simple form or workflow in a no-code app and share it with the developers as a starting point. The data scientist, who might only be comfortable in Python, can use a AI code generator to produce a snippet of JavaScript for the web team. These aren’t hypotheticals; such collaborations are increasingly common.The positive impact is two-fold: first, the team moves in unison rather than waiting on hand-offs. Second, each member gains empathy for the other’s work. Developers see value in the contributions and ideas from non-developers, and non-developers gain appreciation for the complexity of software engineering when they dabble in it with AI help. Specialization silos start to break down. One article on agile business teams noted that AI can act as a “unifying force by automating routine tasks and reducing communication barriers, allowing teams to focus on high-value work” (Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams). In essence, AI can serve as the glue in a team, filling gaps in skills just enough so that no one is completely blocked from contributing to a problem outside their usual domain.It’s important to highlight that this collaboration boost is where much of AI’s value comes from. Speed is a byproduct – if five people can brainstorm in code instead of two, you may solve the problem faster – but the deeper benefit is qualitative. You get more ideas and a sense of shared ownership. The software built by a more inclusive team is likely to consider more angles (usability, business impact, edge cases) from the outset. AI tools, therefore, should be seen as facilitators for this inclusive collaboration. They are like a common language that different specialists can use to speak to each other. A recent industry piece described how cross-functional teams use AI to “break down silos, automate tasks, and make smarter, data-driven decisions” (Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams). When everyone can contribute a bit of code or config, the whole team becomes more agile and innovative.The Ongoing Need for Human Oversight and Critical ThinkingWith all these benefits of AI and automation enabling broader participation, one might ask: does this make programming easier? Does it reduce the need for skilled developers and thoughtful problem-solvers? On the surface it might look that way – if even our tester or business analyst can generate code, maybe programming isn’t so hard anymore. But the truth unfolding in teams is that human oversight and critical thinking are more important than ever.Each time an AI generates code, someone on the team must review that code for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project’s needs. AI is powerful but not magically discerning; it will merrily produce code that looks confident but may be subtly wrong or inefficient. In fact, early studies of AI-generated code found it often contains mistakes or vulnerabilities if taken at face value. GitHub’s own documentation and others have stressed that these tools should be used with a human-in-the-loop mindset. As one guide put it, “Generative AI is not perfect and requires human oversight. It’s safe to say that AI-generated code needs more review than human-written code because it can be more unpredictable” (Is GitHub Copilot safe to use at work?). In practice, this means code reviews, pair programming, and testing are even more critical when AI is involved. The developer who might have spent an hour writing a function from scratch might now spend that hour evaluating an AI-suggested function for edge cases and integrating it properly. The work shifts, but it doesn’t disappear.Debugging is another area that doesn’t vanish with AI – in fact, debugging AI-assisted code can be an exercise in itself. If a piece of code was partially written by an AI, understanding why it’s not working may require peeling back the logic as if it were written by another human (because, effectively, it was written by “someone else” – the AI). This is why savvy teams treat AI outputs as first drafts. The critical thinking comes in refining those drafts. Developers are still architects and problem-solvers at heart; AI doesn’t change that. If anything, it elevates the role of the developer to one of a quality controller and a teacher/mentor. You begin to see senior engineers coaching others on how to prompt the AI effectively, how to spot errors in AI-generated code, and how to improve those suggestions. Their expertise is needed to separate the useful suggestions from the dangerous ones. And when a non-developer on the team produces something with an AI tool, a developer often steps in to validate and productionize it. A recent low-code report noted that after initial hype, companies learned that “experienced developers will have to step in to oversee” these tools in many cases (Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype). The same holds true for AI coding assistants – oversight isn’t optional.So while AI reduces the entry barrier to coding, it simultaneously raises the bar for thoughtfulness in coding. Rather than doing rote work, developers are engaging more in code reviews, in designing good test cases to catch AI slip-ups, and in discerning which tasks are safe to automate vs. which require a human touch. In a way, AI is handling the easy answers, which puts more focus on the hard questions for the humans. It’s a call for developers to deepen their understanding and for teams to communicate even more, to ensure nothing critical is overlooked amidst the AI-generated glut of code.A Philosophical Perspective on Technology and CollaborationAt this juncture, it’s worth stepping back from the technical details and considering the bigger picture of how technology changes human collaboration. There’s a philosophical (and even faith-tinged) reflection to be made here. Throughout history, every significant tool or innovation – from the printing press to the internet – has not only increased productivity but also challenged us to rethink how we work together and what we value in each other. AI is no different. It prompts us to ask: What is our true value as a human on a team? Of the team as a whole? If it’s not cranking out products, perhaps it’s creativity, judgment, and the uniquely human ability to understand another human’s needs.Some may find parallels in spiritual or faith principles about human talents and collaboration. For example, in a community or a body of people, each person has distinct gifts and roles, and the whole flourishes only when those gifts work in harmony. In a similar way, AI is pushing us toward a more harmonious teamwork – one where hierarchy and silos give way to a richer sharing of skills. A senior contributor might need humility to accept a decent solution from an AI or a beginner, while a non-contributor might need the courage to contribute an idea, knowing a supportive team is there to refine it. This dynamic resonates with the idea that everyone has something valuable to bring, and tools are there to amplify this, not diminish that truth.For those of us who view work as not just a transaction but a vocation or even a calling, there’s something hopeful in this trend. It suggests that technology, when approached thoughtfully, can bring out the best in people – more cooperation, more learning, more empathy. It shifts the emphasis from individual output to collective outcome. In a way, it redeems some of the friction that highly specialized tech roles created (where one team throws work to another across a chasm). Now, with AI assisting, we meet in the middle more often. We could liken it to the difference between a soloist and a choir: AI is helping more voices sing. And like any powerful tool, it asks us to wield it with wisdom, grounded in ethical and even spiritual values like honesty (e.g. in acknowledging AI’s limitations), stewardship (responsibly overseeing AI contributions), and trust (trusting teammates to use these new tools wisely and to have each other’s back when something goes wrong).Conclusion: Rethinking AI’s Role for Inclusive, Dynamic TeamsThe infusion of AI into software development is a catalyst for change – not in the dystopian “robots taking our jobs” way, but in a way that invites us to rethink roles and collaboration. Leaders in tech and business have a pivotal role to play in steering this change. Instead of asking, “How much faster can my developers code with AI?”, a better question is, “How can AI enable more people to contribute to coding and bring their unique insights?” The former question treats AI as an automation tool to accelerate what we already do. The latter treats AI as a transformative tool to broaden what we can do as a team.To truly harness AI’s potential, leaders should foster an environment where learning and collaboration trump speed. This means investing in training non-developers to use AI and low-code tools effectively, and training developers to mentor and review in this new context. It means setting up guidelines and guardrails (for example, coding standards and review processes for AI-generated code) so that the ease of creation doesn’t lead to chaos down the line. It also means celebrating the wins where a cross-functional team solved a problem together with the help of AI, rather than just measuring lines of code or velocity points. When a data analyst automates a report via a script they wrote with Copilot’s help, acknowledge that achievement and the developer who helped review it. When a UX designer manages to prototype a new interface with some AI-generated code before handing it to engineering, treat it as a success of teamwork.By reframing AI’s role as collaborator rather than competitor, leaders can alleviate developers’ fears and reduce friction. The narrative shifts from “AI might replace us” to “AI is on our team.” In practical terms, this could look like new team rituals – maybe code review meetings where humans and AI outputs are evaluated together, or “demo days” where non-engineers demo apps or automations they built with minimal code. The more we integrate these tools into the team in a respectful, inclusive way, the more we’ll see dynamic teams emerge. Teams where a QA specialist can fix a minor bug on the fly, and a backend developer is willing to use an AI suggestion from the UX designer’s experiment because it actually worked well.In closing, the message to leaders and practitioners alike is one of realistic optimism. Yes, AI has its pitfalls and it certainly demands oversight and adaptation. But it also holds the promise of a richer collaborative canvas in software development. By breaking myths – that it’s all about speed, or that only developers benefit – we can focus on the real opportunity: building teams that are greater than the sum of their parts. AI is helping to distribute the creative load of coding across more shoulders, and when guided well, those shoulders can carry software projects to places no siloed team could reach. The future of development will not be a factory of coders racing against machines, but a workshop of diverse thinkers using AI tools to create together. It’s time to rethink AI’s role not as an efficiency hack, but as a bridge toward more inclusive and innovative teams – and that is a future every leader should be excited to embrace.",
            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>AI is reshaping software development teams in unexpected ways. Contrary to the hype, the true promise of AI coding tools isn’t about making experienced developers churn out code faster – it’s about empowering <em>non-developers</em> to contribute in ways that once required programming expertise. This shift has led to some misunderstandings about AI’s role in programming teams, with fears of “AI replacing developers” or oversimplified beliefs that <em>low-code/no-code</em> tools will magically boost every team’s productivity. In reality, AI’s greatest impact is in fostering collaboration and breaking down the silos of specialization. By enabling cross-functional team members to participate in coding tasks, AI is helping blend skills and perspectives on a project. Developers are not becoming obsolete; instead, they’re guiding a more diverse team of “citizen developers” and domain experts working together. This blog post clears up common myths and highlights how embracing AI can lead to more inclusive, dynamic software teams rather than isolated, faster coders.</p><h2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR</h2><ul>  <li><strong>AI tools augment teams, not replace programmers:</strong> Tools like GitHub Copilot are often misunderstood. They don’t turn junior coders into rockstar programmers overnight or render senior devs unnecessary – instead, they make coding more <strong>accessible to non-developers</strong>, allowing people with different backgrounds to participate in coding (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). The goal isn’t sheer speed; it’s broader participation.</li>  <li><strong>Low-code/no-code is not a universal silver bullet:</strong> Many leaders assume that low-code and no-code platforms will equally benefit all parts of the organization. In reality, <em>professional developers</em> can feel friction or skepticism when these tools are pushed on them. What excites management as a cost-cutting shortcut may worry developers who must maintain and integrate these citizen-developed “quick apps.” Without proper strategy, you risk <strong>friction between business users and devs</strong> instead of unity.</li>  <li><strong>True value of AI lies in cross-functional collaboration:</strong> The real productivity boost from AI emerges when teams leverage it to enhance cooperation across roles. By lowering the technical barriers, AI lets designers, analysts, and other specialists work alongside developers in new ways. It’s not just about writing code faster, but about <strong>blending expertise</strong> – AI helps break down silos so that solutions are shaped by a variety of perspectives working together.</li>  <li><strong>AI increases the need for oversight and critical thinking:</strong> Paradoxically, introducing AI into coding means <strong>more</strong> diligence, not less. Teams must invest effort in reviewing AI-generated code, debugging unexpected outputs, and validating results. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI <em>amplifies</em> the need for it. Developers shift into roles of reviewers, testers, and facilitators who ensure that the code meets quality standards and project goals. In short, AI doesn’t eliminate the need for critical thinking – it elevates it.</li></ul><h2 id=\"ai-in-the-workplace\">AI in the Workplace</h2><p>Imagine a typical software team meeting in the not-so-distant past: a project manager has a new feature idea, the developers discuss feasibility, the designers think about UI, and the non-tech stakeholders wait for updates. Each role has clear boundaries. Now picture that same meeting today, but with AI-powered tools in the mix. The project manager might use a natural language interface to generate a snippet of code for a prototype. The QA analyst, who isn’t a trained programmer, might use an AI assistant to write an automated test script. The designer could tweak some front-end code via a no-code platform. Meanwhile, the developers on the team aren’t sidelined – they’re actively guiding these efforts, reviewing the AI outputs, and focusing on the trickiest problems that truly require coding expertise. This scenario encapsulates the evolving dynamic: AI in software development is breaking myths and building more integrated teams.</p><h3 id=\"breaking-the-myth-of-ai--faster-coders\">Breaking the Myth of “AI = Faster Coders”</h3><p>One of the biggest myths is that the primary benefit of AI in programming is raw speed – faster coding, fewer developers needed. It’s an assumption that if an AI can generate code, a single developer can now do the work of many, or a junior can do the work of a senior in half the time. <strong>The reality is more nuanced.</strong> Yes, tools like GitHub Copilot can autocomplete boilerplate and help resolve common tasks quickly. However, the <em>true</em> game-changer is how these tools enable people <em>without</em> a traditional coding background to produce working code with some guidance (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). GitHub’s own research and community insights indicate that Copilot makes “coding more accessible to non-developers, empowering people from diverse backgrounds to create software” (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). In practice, this might mean a data analyst can write a custom data transformation script, or an operations specialist can automate a workflow, all with AI assisting in the heavy lifting of syntax and structure.</p><p>From a developer’s perspective, AI does help with productivity – but often by taking care of the simpler tasks (like writing repetitive code or suggesting library calls) so that the human can focus on more complex design and problem-solving. It’s akin to having an intern or a pair-programming buddy who proposes solutions, some of which you accept and others you refine. The net effect isn’t that a developer suddenly types 1000 lines per minute; instead, it’s that <strong>more ideas make it to the table</strong> from more sources. The myth that AI would replace developers or make them code 10x faster misses the point. What’s happening is a redistribution of effort: developers can spend more time thinking through architecture and edge cases, while AI handles some rote implementation under human supervision. Meanwhile, colleagues in other disciplines can contribute prototype code or scripts, which earlier they might have been too intimidated to attempt.</p><h3 id=\"the-low-code-misconception-and-leaderships-leap-of-faith\">The Low-Code Misconception and Leadership’s Leap of Faith</h3><p>On the other side of the AI coin, we have the <em>low-code/no-code movement</em>, which predates today’s AI coding assistants but shares a similar promise: enable anyone to build software with minimal coding. Business leaders have understandably been excited about this. Who wouldn’t want to empower every team to build their own tools and automate tasks without waiting for the IT backlog? The <em>misconception</em>, however, is thinking these tools benefit all teams equally and instantly. Leadership might assume, <em>“If our marketing team can now build their own apps, our developers can be freed up entirely for other work!”</em> or even <em>“Maybe we won’t need as many developers.”</em> This assumption can create friction.</p><p>Professional developers often see a different side to low-code. They know that building an app is more than drawing a workflow or filling out forms – there’s hidden complexity that these platforms abstract away. When non-developers use them heavily, developers are still needed to <strong>step in behind the scenes</strong>. In fact, experience shows that without proper oversight, these citizen-developed applications can become unruly. One industry commentator warned that “without proper oversight and controls, companies may end up with ‘<strong>zombie apps</strong>’ or face security issues” if no-code tools are used carelessly (<a href=\"https://tsh.io/blog/future-of-low-code-no-code/#:~:text=The%20solution%20was%20built%20to,knowledge%20creates%20too%20much%20risk\">Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype</a>). In other words, a well-intentioned sales manager might build a nifty CRM add-on using a no-code tool, but if it’s not aligned with IT governance, it could turn into a security nightmare or a maintenance headache.</p><p>This isn’t to say low-code has no value – it certainly can speed up prototyping and solve localized problems quickly. The mistake is believing it’s a plug-and-play solution for <em>every</em> context. Developers may feel resentment if leadership mandates a low-code platform without consulting them, because they know they’ll be the ones untangling things when the quick-fix app breaks or needs to scale. The healthy way to introduce such tools is with collaboration: invite developers to evaluate and guide the use of low-code solutions, rather than bypass them. Encourage a culture where tech-savvy non-developers and developers build things <em>together</em>, so that the result benefits from business insight and technical rigor. When leadership sets the expectation that <strong>low-code and AI are team enablers, not replacements for the dev team</strong>, you reduce friction. Everyone understands that these tools are there to distribute work more evenly – not to diminish the importance of software craftsmanship.</p><h3 id=\"collaboration-over-acceleration-ais-real-strength\">Collaboration Over Acceleration: AI’s Real Strength</h3><p>There’s a saying that “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” AI in software development is ironically helping teams go <em>together</em>. The greatest wins we’re seeing are not necessarily that Project X finished in 2 weeks instead of 4. It’s that Project X involved more diverse contributors and generated ideas that wouldn’t have surfaced before. AI assists are turning software development into more of a team sport, where the <em>cross-functional</em> nature of modern teams truly shines.</p><p>Consider a cross-functional agile team that includes a product manager, UX designer, backend and frontend developers, a tester, and maybe a data scientist. In the past, the developers were solely responsible for writing code, and the others would contribute in adjacent ways (writing requirements, designing mockups, analyzing data, etc.). With AI, those boundaries blur just a bit. The designer can use an AI tool to help implement a design tweak directly in code (and the frontend dev later polishes it). The product manager can craft a simple form or workflow in a no-code app and share it with the developers as a starting point. The data scientist, who might only be comfortable in Python, can use a AI code generator to produce a snippet of JavaScript for the web team. These aren’t hypotheticals; such collaborations are increasingly common.</p><p>The positive impact is two-fold: first, the team moves in unison rather than waiting on hand-offs. Second, each member gains <em>empathy</em> for the other’s work. Developers see value in the contributions and ideas from non-developers, and non-developers gain appreciation for the complexity of software engineering when they dabble in it with AI help. <strong>Specialization silos start to break down.</strong> One article on agile business teams noted that AI can act as a “unifying force by automating routine tasks and reducing communication barriers, allowing teams to focus on high-value work” (<a href=\"https://www.agilebusiness.org/resource/using-ai-to-empower-cross-functional-teams.html#:~:text=fostering%20collaboration%20among%20diverse%20teams,AI%20to%20identify%20bottlenecks%20or\">Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams</a>). In essence, AI can serve as the glue in a team, filling gaps in skills just enough so that no one is completely blocked from contributing to a problem outside their usual domain.</p><p>It’s important to highlight that this <em>collaboration boost</em> is where much of AI’s value comes from. Speed is a byproduct – if five people can brainstorm in code instead of two, you may solve the problem faster – but the deeper benefit is qualitative. You get more ideas and a sense of shared ownership. The software built by a more inclusive team is likely to consider more angles (usability, business impact, edge cases) from the outset. AI tools, therefore, should be seen as facilitators for this inclusive collaboration. They are like a common language that different specialists can use to speak to each other. A recent industry piece described how cross-functional teams use AI to <em>“break down silos, automate tasks, and make smarter, data-driven decisions”</em> (<a href=\"https://www.agilebusiness.org/resource/using-ai-to-empower-cross-functional-teams.html#:~:text=Using%20AI%20to%20Empower%20Cross,Teams\">Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams</a>). When everyone can contribute a bit of code or config, the whole team becomes more agile and innovative.</p><h3 id=\"the-ongoing-need-for-human-oversight-and-critical-thinking\">The Ongoing Need for Human Oversight and Critical Thinking</h3><p>With all these benefits of AI and automation enabling broader participation, one might ask: does this make programming <em>easier</em>? Does it reduce the need for skilled developers and thoughtful problem-solvers? On the surface it might look that way – if even our tester or business analyst can generate code, maybe programming isn’t so hard anymore. But the truth unfolding in teams is that <strong>human oversight and critical thinking are more important than ever</strong>.</p><p>Each time an AI generates code, someone on the team must review that code for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project’s needs. AI is powerful but not magically discerning; it will merrily produce code that <em>looks</em> confident but may be subtly wrong or inefficient. In fact, early studies of AI-generated code found it often contains mistakes or vulnerabilities if taken at face value. GitHub’s own documentation and others have stressed that these tools should be used with a human-in-the-loop mindset. As one guide put it, <em>“Generative AI is not perfect and requires human oversight. It’s safe to say that AI-generated code needs more review than human-written code because it can be more unpredictable”</em> (<a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/blog/is-github-copilot-safe-to-use-at-work/#:~:text=,what%20they%20are%3A%20just%20suggestions\">Is GitHub Copilot safe to use at work?</a>). In practice, this means code reviews, pair programming, and testing are <em>even more critical</em> when AI is involved. The developer who might have spent an hour writing a function from scratch might now spend that hour evaluating an AI-suggested function for edge cases and integrating it properly. The work shifts, but it doesn’t disappear.</p><p>Debugging is another area that doesn’t vanish with AI – in fact, debugging AI-assisted code can be an exercise in itself.

This article connects those lessons to the energy sector, showing how we can respond with resilience, creativity, and leadership. As AI reshapes how we work, the challenge isn’t just to adapt—but to lead the transformation.##Sam Altman – a leading voice in the tech world and CEO at OpenAI – recently shared “Three Observations” about the astonishing progress of artificial intelligence (AI) (Three Observations - Sam Altman). At first glance, these insights are about AI’s economics and society. But look closer: they carry powerful lessons for us. We live in a region of golden sunlight and desert winds, where innovation isn’t abstract – it’s the solar farm glinting on the horizon and the smart grid systems we deploy every day. Altman’s reflections on rapid technological change, leadership, and adaptability resonate with our mission to provide reliable, clean energy in an evolving market.Altman reminds us that innovation is a continuum – each generation builds on the last to create tools that improve lives. Electricity, the transistor, the computer, the internet – and soon AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) – each emerged as a tool that once seemed unimaginable. Our own industry’s history reflects this too. The electrification of cities, the rise of renewable energy, and today’s smart grids are part of that “ever-taller scaffolding of human progress.” As we face rapid technological change, shifting regulations, and growing demand for sustainable energy, Altman’s observations provide a hopeful roadmap. They remind us that change, however daunting, is how we build a better world.Observation 1: The Power of Scale in InnovationAltman’s First Observation: “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it… you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains.” In simpler terms, bigger investments in innovation can yield disproportionately larger results. Just as feeding an AI more data and compute makes it smarter, investing in cutting-edge energy technology – from advanced solar panels to AI-driven grid management – can continuously improve the AI capabilities developed at companies in California.Observation 2: Rapid Change and Cost TransformationAltman’s Second Observation: “The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10× every 12 months… Moore’s law changed the world at 2× every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger.” In other words, technology is not just progressing – it’s accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Altman notes how AI’s cost of use plummeted (GPT-4’s price per output dropped ~150× in 1.5 years) leading to an explosion in usage. This kind of rapid cost decline and adoption isn’t confined to Silicon Valley; it’s happening here in our energy industry.The old 18-month cycle of Moore’s Law felt fast—now it’s even faster. Our once slow-moving industry now demands rapid shifts, with mandates like California’s push for 60% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% carbon-free by 2045. This isn’t just policy; it reflects how technology is reshaping expectations. Our challenge—and opportunity—is to ride this wave. Staying agile means continuously updating our skills, systems, and mindset. Altman’s insight reveals a thrilling truth: change won’t slow down. We don’t just adapt once for the next 50 years—we embrace constant evolution, where even five years from now, much will be unrecognizable.Observation 3: Small Changes, Huge ImpactsAltman’s Third Observation: “The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature… we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future.” Here, Altman is marveling at the multiplier effect of innovation. A small improvement in AI’s intelligence can yield outsize benefits to society, which then spurs even more investment and innovation. This idea of super-exponential impact is inspiring – it suggests that every step forward we take can lead to a cascade of positive changes.What once seemed trivial now drives exponential gains. In a static business model, 1% inefficiencies were ignored—but today’s fast-moving energy landscape turns small optimizations into major advantages. A 1% boost in data quality sharpens analytics, prevents costly errors, and improves decision-making. Smoother hand-offs between systems eliminate minor delays that, when compounded, cause big inefficiencies.  In a world of constant change, even the smallest improvements amplify across everything we do.Navigating Change: Resilience and AdaptabilityOne of Altman’s most powerful messages isn’t in the numbered list, but in his reflection on how we humans should respond. “The world will not change all at once; it never does… Life will go on mostly the same in the short run… But the future will be coming at us in a way that is impossible to ignore, and the long-term changes… will be huge.” In our context, this is both reassuring and challenging. Day to day, our work may feel familiar – keeping the lights on, serving customers, maintaining equipment. But we know the energy landscape is shifting dramatically over the long term. Altman’s words paint a picture of change that is gradual until, suddenly, it isn’t. We must be ready.How do we get ready? By cultivating exactly the qualities Altman highlights: “agency, willfulness, and determination”, and recognizing that “resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate.” In plain terms, we take initiative, we persevere, and we adapt. Each of us, regardless of role, can practice this adaptability – from a field technician mastering the latest grid automation device to a customer service representative learning to work alongside an AI co-worker. These technologies are coming “eventually [to] feel like virtual co-workers” that amplify what we do. Rather than replace our roles, they can make our work safer, faster, and more impactful – if we are willing to adapt and learn.Altman also emphasizes that technology like AI will empower individuals more than ever before, acting as “the biggest lever ever on human willfulness, enabling individual people to have more impact than ever before, not less.” Imagine the possibilities: an engineer on our team armed with AI analytics might solve in seconds a grid problem that used to take days, or a planner might simulate dozens of power load scenarios by lunchtime. Empowerment is the key word. Leading with Vision: Tying Innovation to Our MissionHuman innovation has always risen to the challenge and improved lives. We in the energy sector are doing this today. We are no strangers to innovation. This is the land that pioneered large-scale solar plants in barren deserts and turned arid landscapes into wind farms. Our culture is built on adapting – from managing the first waves of rooftop solar adoption to building EV charging corridors and battery storage sites. Each challenge we’ve faced – be it new carbon-free energy targets or wildfires and extreme weather – has proven our resilience. We’ve adapted, learned, and emerged stronger each time. This is leadership in action. And this is exactly what Altman’s observations call for: technology may change, but the values of leadership, foresight, and adaptability remain constant.A Call to Action: Innovate, Adapt, and LeadStanding at the crossroads of technological revolution and our urgent sustainability goals, we have a choice. We can stand still – or we can step forward and lead. Sam Altman’s “Three Observations” challenge us to step forward. They urge us to:  Innovate Continuously: Be curious and creative. Whether you’re in engineering, customer service, or regulatory affairs – seek out better ways to do things. Small ideas can spark super-sized impacts. Share your suggestions, pilot new approaches, and don’t be afraid to invest time in learning new technologies.  Adapt with Resilience: Change can be daunting, but it’s also energizing. When faced with new software, new policies, or new market conditions, take it as an opportunity to grow. Lean into training opportunities. Support your colleagues through transitions. As Altman notes, “resilience and adaptability” are skills to cultivate.  Lead from Every Level: You don’t need “Manager” in your title to be a leader. Leadership is a mindset. It’s taking ownership of the situation you are in, its challenges, and being proactive. It’s also about vision – keeping our mission of reliable, clean energy in focus with every decision. Lead by example in safety, in integrity, and in embracing new ideas. When each of us shows agency and determination, our whole organization becomes more proactive and prepared for the future.In the spirit of Altman’s optimism, picture the future we are working toward: a future where our company is not just adapting to the new energy landscape, but shaping it. Picture a summer afternoon in 2037 – the California sun at its zenith – where our grid seamlessly weaves together millions of solar roofs, utility-scale batteries, AI-driven demand response systems, and AI “co-workers” assisting our teams to keep everything running flawlessly. In that future, thanks to innovation, a worker armed with advanced tools might accomplish in a day what once took months. Thanks to adaptability, our company might navigate challenges in stride that once might have knocked us back. Thanks to leadership, we remain the trusted provider of light, power, and hope to our communities.Let’s make that future a reality. The winds of change blowing across our service territory can drive our turbines of progress. The technology that is “coming at us” can be harnessed by us. Altman’s insights remind us that this is our moment to innovate, to adapt, and to lead. As we continue our mission to deliver clean, reliable energy, let’s do so with a mindset that every one of us can be a pioneer. In the face of rapid change, we will not only keep up – we will set the pace. Together, we will innovate. We will adapt. We will lead.",

            "summary": "An in-depth technical analysis of DeepSeek R1's groundbreaking five-step training methodology, using dog training metaphors to explain complex reinforcement learning concepts that created the first open-weight reasoning model trained from scratch.",
            
            "content_text": "Step 1: Training R1-Zero with Synthetic Data to Initialize R1Example for Step 1Throughout this paper I will be using the metaphor of training a dog to describe how this will work. To experts in this field, many will see these examples as wrong, or they will be able to come up with better examples. I have spent a lot of time trying to come up with something that most people can connect with and understand.  You want to get puppy for your kids. You go down to the store and buy the dog. You have two options. You can train the dog yourself, or you can let the dog live over at your friends house who already has 3 well behaved dogs who are well behaved. Traditional AI model training take this second approach. Instead of training your new puppy, you let it spend a couple weeks to a month with the other older dogs and after that time, your dog knows how to behave and is well adjusted. It might not know every command you want, and the dog doesn’t know your family, but there is a bunch of work you don’t have to do to train your dog properly. The DeepSeek researchers took the approach of training their dog from day one once the dog was born. This takes longer, and your dog might not know how to behave properly in a pack, but overall that’s a fair tradeoff.Details for Step 1DeepSeek R1-Zero represents a groundbreaking advancement as the first open-weight model trained exclusively using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as an initial step. While rumors suggested OpenAI’s o1 model employed a similar approach, its underlying mechanics were not well understood.Despite its innovation, R1-Zero exhibits certain reliability issues, including sporadic language shifts during reasoning tasks. These usability challenges highlight a key insight: while large-scale RL is essential for unlocking reasoning capabilities, it alone is insufficient to produce a fully reliable model. This underscores the need for additional refinement steps beyond reinforcement learning to create robust reasoning models.Breakthrough in Reinforcement Learning ScalingDeepSeek’s research introduces a pivotal finding—demonstrating how reinforcement learning training time directly impacts model performance. Prior industry focus has primarily been on inference-time scaling, where longer inference times correlate with improved evaluation scores. DeepSeek’s work extends this understanding to training time, providing empirical evidence that prolonged reinforcement learning improves reasoning model quality.Internal testing suggests that had the team allowed this phase to continue for a longer period, the overall performance of R1 would have further improved. Unlike other AI training curves that plateau, the reinforcement learning phase for R1-Zero did not reach a saturation point before deployment. However, hardware constraints and computational resources imposed limitations on further optimization.If a well-funded research team—particularly in Western institutions—were to replicate this approach using modern hardware and extend training duration, they could likely achieve significantly higher benchmark scores. This suggests that reinforcement learning-driven reasoning models have not yet reached their full potential and could benefit from further scaling and refinement.The Significance of Cold-Start TrainingStep 1, the “cold start” phase, is fundamental for model training. Many AI teams bypass this stage by leveraging existing models as a foundation, rather than training from scratch. DeepSeek’s findings indicate that investing in this phase yields a stronger final model, reinforcing the value of a complete end-to-end training pipeline. This insight presents an opportunity for AI teams to revisit their model initialization strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities.Optimizing Model Design for Reasoning AIDeepSeek’s research also highlights an important consideration for reasoning models: response verbosity and its impact on reasoning chains. If a base model generates excessively long responses, it may struggle to maintain logical consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks. This issue suggests that reasoning models could benefit from an optimized balance between verbosity and structured thinking to maintain coherence in complex problem-solving scenarios.Agile Training Approaches for Rapid Model ImprovementResource constraints led the DeepSeek team to adopt an agile-style training methodology, iterating in small batches with frequent updates. While typical reasoning model training involves hundreds of optimization cycles, DeepSeek performed thousands of rapid updates (“sprints”), allowing for continuous refinement. This high-frequency iterative approach presents another avenue for improvement, as more frequent training updates could accelerate advancements in reasoning models.Step 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Enhanced Readability and PerformanceExample for Step 2  Now that we have our puppy and we are not going to ignore his training, we need to establish a couple things. One is a reward marker, usually a clicker, and some form of negative marker, generally a “No”, “Opps”, a tug on the leash, or some other sort of sound to let the dog know the exact location they did well, or where they went wrong.Step 2To improve the clarity, consistency, and reasoning accuracy of the final model, DeepSeek applies a targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before reinforcement learning. This step refines the base model using a curated dataset consisting of a few thousand high-quality completions generated by R1-Zero.Key Refinement TechniquesWhile this fine-tuning process is relatively lightweight, it plays a critical role in improving output quality. DeepSeek employs several optimization techniques, including:  Few-shot prompting with structured, multi-step reasoning examples to guide model responses.  Direct prompting for detailed answers, encouraging self-reflection and verification within responses.  Formatting model outputs for readability, ensuring consistency in structure and presentation.  Post-processing by human annotators, refining data quality and improving response reliability.For teams looking to replicate this process, any of these techniques can be applied, and leveraging DeepSeek R1 itself may provide the most efficient path forward.This supervised fine-tuning step optimizes the model’s training trajectory, making it easier to develop self-correction and reasoning behaviors during reinforcement learning. It enhances the likelihood that the model will exhibit advanced cognitive traits such as:  Self-verification: “Let me double-check my work.”  Error recognition: “That answer seems incorrect; let me refine it.”By laying this groundwork early, the reinforcement learning phase can more effectively strengthen these reasoning capabilities, resulting in a more reliable and interpretable AI model.Step 3: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning ModelsExample for Step 3  Think of this like training a dog. You give a command, the dog responds, and if it does the right thing, you give it a treat. Over time, it learns which actions lead to rewards and improves its behavior. Here, the model is the “dog,” the responses are its “actions,” and the rewards help it learn what works best.Step 3Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning models operates on a fundamental principle: reward the model for producing correct answers in cases where correctness can be objectively verified. This structured feedback loop helps shape the model’s reasoning capabilities, ensuring it converges toward higher accuracy and usability.DeepSeek’s reinforcement learning approach incorporates three key reward mechanisms during the reasoning phase:  Accuracy Rewards – The primary driver of learning, where the model receives a positive score if its response is correct and zero otherwise.  Format Rewards – Ensures that responses follow a structured format using designated tags (e.g.,  ... ,  ... ), reinforcing stability and interpretability in outputs.  Language Consistency Rewards – Encourages responses to be in the same language as the query to improve user experience. While DeepSeek notes a slight reduction in raw performance from this adjustment, it enhances alignment with human preferences.While accuracy rewards form the core learning mechanism, the format and language consistency rewards act as guardrails, ensuring that responses are both structured and user-friendly. To implement this reward system, DeepSeek utilizes a customized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning approach widely adopted in AI research. Their version relies on Monte Carlo advantage estimates for value approximation instead of storing a separate value model in memory—an approach likely chosen for its efficiency and compatibility with DeepSeek’s existing infrastructure.The Importance of Verifiable Training DataThe effectiveness of reinforcement learning in reasoning AI hinges on the availability of verifiable, high-quality training data. While DeepSeek has not publicly disclosed its dataset, OpenAI has described using fact-based evaluations, such as:  Example Question: Who are President Obama’s children?  Evaluation Method: A predefined list of correct, partially correct, and incorrect answers assigns scores accordingly.This structured evaluation approach is particularly valuable for domain-specific AI applications, such as:  Industrial AI models that process sensor data, where equipment variability and environmental conditions must be factored into decision-making.  Enterprise AI systems trained on proprietary internal knowledge, where accuracy must be maintained despite the absence of widely agreed-upon external sources.Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning: Computational ConsiderationsReinforcement learning for reasoning requires multiple model instances running in parallel, alternating between generating responses, verifying outputs, and iterating backward to refine results. As one researcher at Cornell noted, “We need to code up verifiers ASAP”, emphasizing the importance of building domain-specific verification systems. For enterprises exploring RL-based AI, a practical first step is to develop tools and datasets tailored to a single domain before scaling across multiple areas.Step 4: Rejection Sampling to Introduce General CapabilitiesExample for Step 4  Think of this like training a dog. You give the command to fetch a stick. But instead of rewarding the dog with any attempt, you observe all the possible ways he can retrieve the stick. Perhaps he crews on it. Perhaps he plays a game of tug of war with you when he returns it. Maybe he drops it at your feet. You make a list of all the ways your dog returns the stick and then decide that the best fetch is where he returns the stick to your feet, sits back and gets your attention. The sloppy fetch is him getting the stick and playing tug of war. A failed fetch would be where he either runs off with the stick or he ignores the stick. Now you take your dog out to the field and you throw the stick. This time the dog gets no rewards for failure, but the dog also gets better rewards for the behaviors you prefer. It might take a couple times to get the dog to fetch the stick, sit, and alert.Step 4Rejection sampling is a well-established post-training technique used to refine model outputs by generating multiple responses, ranking them with a reward model, and fine-tuning the original model based on the highest-quality completions. This method is commonly employed in AI training pipelines, including models like Llama 3, to enhance performance across a variety of tasks.DeepSeek applies rejection sampling to reintroduce general-purpose capabilities into the model, ensuring that reasoning-focused refinements do not come at the cost of broader AI versatility. This phase is the only stage where DeepSeek discloses specific training data volumes:  800,000 total completions          600,000 focused on reasoning tasks      200,000 focused on general chat interactions      The Strategic Value of Training DataThe goal in this stage is to curate a training set of high-quality completions, particularly for factual reasoning tasks. Consider the example of asking, “Who are President Obama’s (or Trump’s) children?”—this represents a chain of reasoning grounded in verifiable facts and widely accepted processes, such as:  Scientific methodologies  Programming and algorithmic principles  Theoretical foundations of chemistry, physics, and philosophyFor AI applications in corporate environments, this phase underscores the critical importance of proprietary domain-specific datasets. Whether building AI for enterprise decision-making, industry-specific automation, or knowledge management, access to validated, high-quality training data is a key differentiator.DeepSeek’s Approach to Rejection SamplingDeepSeek refines this process by leveraging multiple data sources and verification strategies:  Generative reward models – Using another large language model (LLM) as a judge (e.g., ChatGPT) to verify responses that lack explicit factual answers.  DeepSeek-V3’s post-training pipeline – Incorporating refined data from prior AI iterations to enhance response quality.  Augmented chat data with structured reasoning steps – Training the model to interpret and apply logical reasoning even in less formally structured conversations, improving its ability to generalize across different use cases.Step 5: Final Reinforcement Learning for General UseExample for Step 5  In our dog example, think of this final phase and the socialization phase of your dogs education. While I mentioned earlier things that look like socialization, this is a bit different. You want to walk your dog around the neighborhood to see how it reacts to loud noises, like leaf blowers. You want to take your dog to the dog park to see how it will interact with other dogs. You want to make sure you dog knows how to behave around humans and other animals you have in the house and in the neighborhood.Step 5In the final stage, DeepSeek R1 undergoes a second round of reinforcement learning (RL), a process that is increasingly becoming the dominant method for fine-tuning AI models. This phase is designed to enhance the model’s reasoning capabilities while optimizing it for general usability, focusing on improving both helpfulness and safety.However, it is important to note that in this stage, DeepSeek appears to have operated under different regulatory and data constraints than Western AI labs. Reports suggest that content alignment measures were influenced by external factors, including the potential prioritization of state-approved narratives in politically sensitive areas. While this may be driven by a need to secure continued research funding, it underscores the complex relationship between AI model development and geopolitical considerations.Fine-Tuning Strategy: Reinforcement Learning with Multiple Reward ModelsTo refine general usability, DeepSeek combines two key reinforcement learning techniques:  Verifiable Domain Reinforcement Learning – Extending the fact-based training used in R1-Zero to reinforce accuracy in areas with clear correctness standards.  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) – Incorporating preference tuning to align responses with user expectations and ensure a more natural, human-like interaction.This approach builds upon DeepSeek’s existing post-training pipeline from V3, leveraging multiple reward models to optimize response quality and adherence to structured reasoning.Challenges in Reinforcement Learning Fine-TuningSuccessfully executing this phase requires addressing several open research questions:  Data Balance: How much factual, verifiable data should be used versus human preference-driven tuning?  Reward Model Selection: Can an existing off-the-shelf reward model be used, or does it need exposure to complex reasoning traces?  Performance Trade-offs: Are additional safeguards needed to prevent degradation in reasoning ability while improving user-friendliness?As AI research advances, these challenges will be refined through ongoing experimentation and iteration.Scalability and Future ConsiderationsOne of the most significant advantages of this approach is that once an AI model learns a task, replicating that knowledge across subsequent models becomes exponentially more efficient. As knowledge transfer becomes more streamlined, AI training will increasingly resemble a simple “Copy-Paste” process, where fundamental reasoning skills and alignment strategies can be rapidly applied to new models with minimal additional effort.While many details of DeepSeek’s methodology remain undisclosed, the broader framework for reasoning model fine-tuning is becoming clearer. Future research will focus on optimizing reinforcement learning strategies to balance reasoning depth, general usability, and ethical considerations.",
            "content_html": "<p><strong>Step 1: Training R1-Zero with Synthetic Data to Initialize R1</strong></p><p><em>Example for Step 1</em></p><p>Throughout this paper I will be using the metaphor of training a dog to describe how this will work. To experts in this field, many will see these examples as wrong, or they will be able to come up with better examples. I have spent a lot of time trying to come up with something that most people can connect with and understand.</p><blockquote>  <p>You want to get puppy for your kids. You go down to the store and buy the dog. You have two options. You can train the dog yourself, or you can let the dog live over at your friends house who already has 3 well behaved dogs who are well behaved. Traditional AI model training take this second approach. Instead of training your new puppy, you let it spend a couple weeks to a month with the other older dogs and after that time, your dog knows how to behave and is well adjusted. It might not know every command you want, and the dog doesn’t know your family, but there is a bunch of work you don’t have to do to train your dog properly. The DeepSeek researchers took the approach of training their dog from day one once the dog was born. This takes longer, and your dog might not know how to behave properly in a pack, but overall that’s a fair tradeoff.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Details for Step 1</strong></p><p>DeepSeek R1-Zero represents a groundbreaking advancement as the first <strong>open-weight model trained exclusively using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as an initial step.</strong> While rumors suggested OpenAI’s o1 model employed a similar approach, its underlying mechanics were not well understood.</p><p>Despite its innovation, R1-Zero exhibits certain reliability issues, including sporadic language shifts during reasoning tasks. These usability challenges highlight a key insight: while large-scale RL is essential for unlocking reasoning capabilities, <strong>it alone is insufficient to produce a fully reliable model</strong>. This underscores the need for additional refinement steps beyond reinforcement learning to create robust reasoning models.</p><p><strong>Breakthrough in Reinforcement Learning Scaling</strong></p><p>DeepSeek’s research introduces a pivotal finding—<strong>demonstrating how reinforcement learning training time directly impacts model performance</strong>. Prior industry focus has primarily been on inference-time scaling, where longer inference times correlate with improved evaluation scores. DeepSeek’s work extends this understanding to training time, providing empirical evidence that prolonged reinforcement learning improves reasoning model quality.</p><p>Internal testing suggests that had the team allowed this phase to continue for a longer period, the overall performance of R1 would have further improved. Unlike other AI training curves that plateau, the reinforcement learning phase for R1-Zero <strong>did not reach a saturation point before deployment</strong>. However, hardware constraints and computational resources imposed limitations on further optimization.</p><p>If a well-funded research team—particularly in Western institutions—were to replicate this approach using modern hardware and extend training duration, they could likely <strong>achieve significantly higher benchmark scores</strong>. This suggests that reinforcement learning-driven reasoning models have not yet reached their full potential and could benefit from further scaling and refinement.</p><p><strong>The Significance of Cold-Start Training</strong></p><p>Step 1, the <strong>“cold start” phase</strong>, is fundamental for model training. Many AI teams bypass this stage by leveraging existing models as a foundation, rather than training from scratch. DeepSeek’s findings indicate that investing in this phase <strong>yields a stronger final model</strong>, reinforcing the value of a complete end-to-end training pipeline. This insight presents an opportunity for AI teams to revisit their model initialization strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities.</p><p><strong>Optimizing Model Design for Reasoning AI</strong></p><p>DeepSeek’s research also highlights an important consideration for reasoning models: <strong>response verbosity and its impact on reasoning chains</strong>. If a base model generates excessively long responses, it may struggle to maintain logical consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks. This issue suggests that reasoning models could benefit from an optimized balance between verbosity and structured thinking to maintain coherence in complex problem-solving scenarios.</p><p><strong>Agile Training Approaches for Rapid Model Improvement</strong></p><p>Resource constraints led the DeepSeek team to adopt an <strong>agile-style training methodology</strong>, iterating in small batches with frequent updates. While typical reasoning model training involves hundreds of optimization cycles, DeepSeek performed <strong>thousands of rapid updates (“sprints”)</strong>, allowing for continuous refinement. This <strong>high-frequency iterative approach</strong> presents another avenue for improvement, as more frequent training updates could accelerate advancements in reasoning models.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Enhanced Readability and Performance</strong></p><p><em>Example for Step 2</em></p><blockquote>  <p>Now that we have our puppy and we are not going to ignore his training, we need to establish a couple things. One is a reward marker, usually a clicker, and some form of negative marker, generally a “No”, “Opps”, a tug on the leash, or some other sort of sound to let the dog know the exact location they did well, or where they went wrong.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p><p>To <strong>improve the clarity, consistency, and reasoning accuracy</strong> of the final model, DeepSeek applies a <strong>targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase</strong> before reinforcement learning. This step refines the base model using a curated dataset consisting of <strong>a few thousand high-quality completions</strong> generated by R1-Zero.</p><p><strong>Key Refinement Techniques</strong></p><p>While this fine-tuning process is relatively lightweight, it plays a critical role in improving output quality. DeepSeek employs several optimization techniques, including:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Few-shot prompting</strong> with structured, multi-step reasoning examples to guide model responses.</li>  <li><strong>Direct prompting for detailed answers</strong>, encouraging self-reflection and verification within responses.</li>  <li><strong>Formatting model outputs for readability</strong>, ensuring consistency in structure and presentation.</li>  <li><strong>Post-processing by human annotators</strong>, refining data quality and improving response reliability.</li></ul><p>For teams looking to replicate this process, <strong>any of these techniques can be applied</strong>, and leveraging DeepSeek R1 itself may provide the most efficient path forward.</p><p>This supervised fine-tuning step <strong>optimizes the model’s training trajectory</strong>, making it easier to develop <strong>self-correction and reasoning behaviors</strong> during reinforcement learning. It enhances the likelihood that the model will exhibit advanced cognitive traits such as:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Self-verification:</strong> “Let me double-check my work.”</li>  <li><strong>Error recognition:</strong> “That answer seems incorrect; let me refine it.”</li></ul><p>By laying this groundwork early, the reinforcement learning phase can <strong>more effectively strengthen these reasoning capabilities</strong>, resulting in a more reliable and interpretable AI model.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Models</strong></p><p><em>Example for Step 3</em></p><blockquote>  <p>Think of this like training a dog. You give a command, the dog responds, and if it does the right thing, you give it a treat. Over time, it learns which actions lead to rewards and improves its behavior. Here, the model is the “dog,” the responses are its “actions,” and the rewards help it learn what works best.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning models operates on a fundamental principle: <strong>reward the model for producing correct answers in cases where correctness can be objectively verified</strong>. This structured feedback loop helps shape the model’s reasoning capabilities, ensuring it converges toward higher accuracy and usability.</p><p>DeepSeek’s reinforcement learning approach incorporates <strong>three key reward mechanisms</strong> during the reasoning phase:</p><ol>  <li><strong>Accuracy Rewards</strong> – The primary driver of learning, where the model receives a <strong>positive score if its response is correct</strong> and zero otherwise.</li>  <li><strong>Format Rewards</strong> – Ensures that responses follow a structured format using designated tags (e.g., <think> ... </think>, <answer> ... </answer>), reinforcing <strong>stability and interpretability</strong> in outputs.</li>  <li><strong>Language Consistency Rewards</strong> – Encourages responses to be in the <strong>same language as the query</strong> to improve user experience. While DeepSeek notes a slight reduction in raw performance from this adjustment, it enhances <strong>alignment with human preferences</strong>.</li></ol><p>While accuracy rewards form the core learning mechanism, the <strong>format and language consistency rewards act as guardrails</strong>, ensuring that responses are both structured and user-friendly. To implement this reward system, DeepSeek utilizes a <strong>customized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm</strong>, a reinforcement learning approach widely adopted in AI research. Their version <strong>relies on Monte Carlo advantage estimates for value approximation</strong> instead of storing a separate value model in memory—an approach likely chosen for its efficiency and compatibility with DeepSeek’s existing infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Verifiable Training Data</strong></p><p>The effectiveness of reinforcement learning in reasoning AI hinges on <strong>the availability of verifiable, high-quality training data</strong>. While DeepSeek has not publicly disclosed its dataset, OpenAI has described using fact-based evaluations, such as:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Example Question:</strong> <em>Who are President Obama’s children?</em></li>  <li><strong>Evaluation Method:</strong> A predefined list of correct, partially correct, and incorrect answers assigns scores accordingly.</li></ul><p>This structured evaluation approach is particularly <strong>valuable for domain-specific AI applications</strong>, such as:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Industrial AI models</strong> that process sensor data, where equipment variability and environmental conditions must be factored into decision-making.</li>  <li><strong>Enterprise AI systems</strong> trained on <strong>proprietary internal knowledge</strong>, where accuracy must be maintained despite the absence of widely agreed-upon external sources.</li></ul><p><strong>Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning: Computational Considerations</strong></p><p>Reinforcement learning for reasoning requires <strong>multiple model instances running in parallel</strong>, alternating between generating responses, verifying outputs, and iterating backward to refine results. As one researcher at Cornell noted, <strong>“We need to code up verifiers ASAP”</strong>, emphasizing the importance of <strong>building domain-specific verification systems</strong>. For enterprises exploring RL-based AI, a <strong>practical first step is to develop tools and datasets tailored to a single domain before scaling across multiple areas</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Rejection Sampling to Introduce General Capabilities</strong></p><p><em>Example for Step 4</em></p><blockquote>  <p>Think of this like training a dog. You give the command to fetch a stick. But instead of rewarding the dog with any attempt, you observe all the possible ways he can retrieve the stick. Perhaps he crews on it. Perhaps he plays a game of tug of war with you when he returns it. Maybe he drops it at your feet. You make a list of all the ways your dog returns the stick and then decide that the best fetch is where he returns the stick to your feet, sits back and gets your attention. The sloppy fetch is him getting the stick and playing tug of war. A failed fetch would be where he either runs off with the stick or he ignores the stick. Now you take your dog out to the field and you throw the stick. This time the dog gets no rewards for failure, but the dog also gets better rewards for the behaviors you prefer. It might take a couple times to get the dog to fetch the stick, sit, and alert.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p><p>Rejection sampling is a well-established post-training technique used to refine model outputs by <strong>generating multiple responses, ranking them with a reward model, and fine-tuning the original model based on the highest-quality completions</strong>. This method is commonly employed in AI training pipelines, including models like Llama 3, to enhance performance across a variety of tasks.</p><p>DeepSeek applies rejection sampling to <strong>reintroduce general-purpose capabilities into the model</strong>, ensuring that reasoning-focused refinements do not come at the cost of broader AI versatility. This phase is <strong>the only stage where DeepSeek discloses specific training data volumes</strong>:</p><ul>  <li><strong>800,000 total completions</strong>    <ul>      <li><strong>600,000 focused on reasoning tasks</strong></li>      <li><strong>200,000 focused on general chat interactions</strong></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p><strong>The Strategic Value of Training Data</strong></p><p>The goal in this stage is to <strong>curate a training set of high-quality completions</strong>, particularly for factual reasoning tasks. Consider the example of asking, <em>“Who are President Obama’s (or Trump’s) children?”</em>—this represents a <strong>chain of reasoning grounded in verifiable facts and widely accepted processes</strong>, such as:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Scientific methodologies</strong></li>  <li><strong>Programming and algorithmic principles</strong></li>  <li><strong>Theoretical foundations of chemistry, physics, and philosophy</strong></li></ul><p>For AI applications in corporate environments, this phase underscores the <strong>critical importance of proprietary domain-specific datasets</strong>.

            "content_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: Project Stargate is OpenAI’s $500 billion bet on the future of AI infrastructure—a data center of unprecedented scale designed to power the next generation of models like ChatGPT-7. Backed by global investors and tech giants, Stargate reflects a strategic shift toward private-sector-driven AI innovation, with massive energy demands, nuclear power exploration, and a timeline that redefines what’s possible in computational capability. More than a facility, Stargate signals the arrival of AI as national infrastructure.Project Stargate finally came out of stealth mode last week. News of this project has been spoken of in leaks and behind closed doors now for over a couple of years. What emerged confirms the whispers: Stargate is poised to redefine the limits of computational infrastructure.Estimated to be one of the largest and most advanced data centers in the world, Stargate spans several hundred acres and is projected to consume up to 5 gigawatts of power—a figure that rivals the energy demands of some small nations. This initiative represents the next leap in OpenAI’s mission to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. Its sheer scale underscores its importance in training and operating increasingly sophisticated AI models.How is it being funded? The project is set to cost $500 billion. With an initial build out of $100 billion to get the project going. No funding will come from the federal government; it will all be sourced from private-sector investments. The project is backed by four founding companies:  OpenAI: U.S.-based AI research organization which will have operational responsibility will provide approximately $20b  SoftBank: Japan-based investment company which will have financial responsibility will provide approximately $20b  Oracle: U.S.-based computer technology company which has approximately $11b to invest on its balance sheet  MGX: Investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates has approximately $100b on its balance sheet to invest in AI.The project will have the following technology partners:  Arm: UK-based semiconductor and software design company which will provide hardware and software designs.  Microsoft: US-based technology and software company which seems like it will provide compute for the runtime of the model in its Azure Data Centers to the tune of $80b  NVIDIA: US-based graphics processing and AI hardware company which will probide hardware, software, Build and Operational Expertise.  Oracle: US- US based computer technology company which will provide build and operational expertise  OpenAI: US- US based AI research organization which will provide build and operational expertise.What is the federal government’s involvement? Former President Donald Trump announced his intent to intervene when necessary to expedite the project’s progress, citing its significance for maintaining U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. “What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,” Trump stated. “China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we’re making it available. I’m going to help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency. We have to get this stuff built.”Additionally, Trump revoked an executive order issued by President Joe Biden that called for regulation and oversight of artificial intelligence. The new directive aimed to eliminate barriers for U.S. companies to develop AI. “This order revokes certain existing AI policies and directives that act as barriers to American AI innovation, clearing a path for the United States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial intelligence,” the order stated.Central to Stargate’s purpose is the development of “ChatGPT 7”, a generational leap forward in AI. To achieve this, Stargate will likely rely on cutting-edge hardware, including Rubin Ultra 200 NVIDIA chips and other advanced 2-nanometer chipsets provided by ARM. NVIDIA’s roadmap has consistently pushed the envelope for AI acceleration, and Stargate’s adoption of this technology reflects a commitment to unparalleled processing power and efficiency. These innovations will be critical in handling the immense computational demands of training ChatGPT 7 and beyond.The timeline for Project Stargate’s milestones offers insight into the ambition and urgency behind the initiative:  Data Center Built Complete: Late 2027  GPT 7 Build Complete: May 2028  GPT 7 Speed Optimized Build Complete: November 2028  GPT 7.5 Feature Complete: May 2029Last week, the project’s location was made public: Stargate will be built in Abilene, Texas. The facility will feature 10 buildings, each 500,000 square feet in size, with plans for expansion to 20 buildings. However, the additional buildings are not planned for Texas; OpenAI is exploring other locations across the United States for these expansions. These data centers are designed to handle the intense power requirements of AI workloads. While most data centers consume 500–600 watts per square foot for compute, GPU-intensive AI workloads demand double that, ranging from 500 to 1,000 watts per square foot. Another critical consideration is Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which measures the efficiency of a data center by comparing the energy used for IT compute to the energy used for non-IT functions like cooling. In 2020, the average PUE for data centers was 1.6, but modern designs aim for a target below 1.4. Companies like Facebook and Google have even achieved PUE ratios as low as 1.2.If Stargate achieves a PUE of 1.2 and operates at 750 watts per square foot, the energy consumption per square foot would be 900 watts. For a 500,000-square-foot building, this translates to 450 megawatts of power consumption per building. With 10 buildings, the facility’s total power demand would reach 4,500 megawatts (4.5 gigawatts). To put this into perspective, Texas’s nuclear power plants produced 4,926.2 megawatts in 2022, accounting for 10% of the state’s energy generation, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A data center of this size aligns with leaks out of OpenAI from a year ago that the data center would consume 5GW of power.Powering a facility of this magnitude brings its own set of challenges. To address the enormous energy consumption, the project has explored alternative power sources, including nuclear energy. The choice highlights the need for stable, high-output, and environmentally conscious power solutions, aligning with broader industry trends toward sustainability.The scale of Stargate comes with an equally staggering cost. The project is estimated to require $500 billion, a sum that is ten times the current global annual spend on data centers. To put this into perspective, Stargate’s budget rivals some of the most significant infrastructure and scientific endeavors in history:  American Interstate Project: $618 billion  Apollo Program Costs: $190 billion  Manhattan Project Costs: $31.4 billion  International Space Station: $100 billion  California High-Speed Rail System: $100 billion  Los Angeles Transit Buildout: $150 billionThese comparisons highlight how Stargate’s investment represents a bold step into uncharted territory, emphasizing the profound importance placed on AI’s role in shaping the future. Unlike the projects above, which transformed transportation, space exploration, and global security, Stargate focuses on the digital frontier—ushering in an era where computation and artificial intelligence redefine the boundaries of human potential.Stargate represents more than just a data center; it’s a statement about the future of AI. By investing in infrastructure at this scale, OpenAI demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of artificial intelligence. As this project unfolds, its ripple effects will likely shape the trajectory of AI development for years to come.",
