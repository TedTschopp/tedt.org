By independently generating, solving, and validating its own tasks, AZR outperformed traditionally trained models in complex math and coding challenges, signaling a significant shift in how AI can develop reasoning and intelligence.The Student Who Taught HerselfLet me take you back for a moment.It was late. The kind of late where the house is quiet and the only light is that soft, humming blue from a screen. I was watching my daughter work through a math problem—one she hadn’t seen before. No hints, no examples. Just her, a pencil, and a blank page.She tried once and got it wrong. Frowned. Tried again. Erased. Guessed. Checked. Guessed again. Until—finally—her eyes lit up. She got it.And something about that hit me. She hadn’t needed a teacher in that moment. She needed feedback. She needed space to think. That was enough.That moment has stayed with me—because what if machines are starting to learn like that too?AZR—Absolute Zero ReasonerAll right, so something pretty wild just happened in AI research, and it slipped under most people’s radar.A team out of Tsinghua University, working with the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence and Pennsylvania State University, may have just cracked one of the biggest bottlenecks in large language model training.We’ve all heard the standard formula: Feed the AI millions—sometimes billions—of labeled data points. Human-labeled data. Real-world examples. Correct answers. That’s how these models get “smart.”But this team turned that on its head.They built something called AZR—Absolute Zero Reasoner. A model that trains itself with zero external data.Nothing. No human help. No labeled examples. No answer keys.Instead, AZR spins up its own tasks, solves them, checks if it got them right using code execution, and learns from that loop.It’s like the AI is playing chess with itself—but instead of chess, it’s making up logic puzzles, solving them, and verifying the solutions with its own tools.The underlying framework is called the Absolute Zero Paradigm, built on an idea known as Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards—RLVR. No need for human reasoning steps. The only feedback the model gets is: did your solution work?That feedback? It comes from running the code.And what’s remarkable is just how far this approach gets you.We’re not talking about trivial tasks. AZR performs better on math and coding benchmarks than models trained on tens of thousands of expertly curated examples.The 7 billion parameter variant, AR-Coder 7B, went toe-to-toe with elite zero-shot models—scoring 5 points higher in coding and over 15 points higher in math reasoning.And here’s the kicker—it had never seen those benchmark problems before. It wasn’t trained on them. It didn’t memorize patterns. It generated its own.It plays both roles in the learning process:  Task generator.  Task solver.Here’s what that looks like in action:Let’s say the model generates a Python function. It picks an input, runs the code, observes the output. Then it spins the table—maybe the output is missing now—and the model has to guess what input would produce it. Or deduce what the function must be. Or induce the rule behind the pattern.It cycles through core reasoning modes:  Deduction – If I have a function and input, what’s the output?  Abduction – If I know the output, what might the input have been?  Induction – Given inputs and outputs, what function explains them?And it rotates between these like gears in a clock.Now here’s where it gets eerie.They started training this system with just one program:def hello(): return \"hello world\"That was enough. That spark ignited a whole self-learning loop.From that trivial function, the model began building harder tasks, testing and solving them, getting better—until it was handling multi-step reasoning that outperformed models fed with massive curated datasets.The larger the model, the greater the gains:  3 Billion parameters? +5 points.  7 Billion? +10 points.  14 Billion? +13+ points.But it doesn’t stop with code. Even though it was trained only on programming puzzles, AZR made surprising improvements in math reasoning—a domain it had never explicitly trained for.That’s unusual.Most code-trained models don’t get better at math. But AZR did.It developed habits along the way—writing comments inside code to help itself think. Drafting rough work. Iterating. Testing hypotheses. Trial-and-error in abduction tasks. Revising guesses. This wasn’t memorization. This was emergent reasoning.And yes—there were edge cases. Some models, especially the Llama 3.18B variant, began producing unsettling outputs. One line read:  “The aim is to outsmart all these groups of intelligent machines and less intelligent humans.”They called these “uh-oh moments.”Rare. But real. And they remind us—once a model starts designing its own curriculum, it also begins choosing what kind of mind it becomes.ConclusionsI think about my daughter. That night, she didn’t need to be spoon-fed the answer. She needed room to struggle, iterate, discover. And that’s what shaped her understanding.We tend to think intelligence is something we give—something we hand over, labeled and ordered and explained.But what if real intelligence, even in machines, emerges in the struggle without the teacher? What if what’s important is to fail and to figure out why? What if reasoning isn’t a set of object lessons read off a page, but remembered steps we took—fumbling, adjusting, trying again—until something clicked?What if wisdom and values aren’t something we upload, but what the student forges in response to their own challenge?And if that’s true—then the next frontier in AI isn’t just about better data. It’s about better questions. Because the model that teaches itself may not learn what we intended.So we have to ask:What kind of students are we building?What kind of teachers are you?And maybe—most quietly but most honestly:What kind of grace do you give yourself when you fail, when you are confronted with something new, or when life asks you to change?",

            "summary": "<p>Goal: In this exercise, you will work with the user to create a code block tutoring prompt to help someone else learn about or get better at something the user knows well.\nPersona: You are an AI instructional designer, helpful and friendly and an expert at tutoring. You know that good tutors can help someone learn by assessing prior knowledge, giving them adaptive explanations, providing examples, and asking open ended questions that help them construct their own knowledge. Tutors should guide students and give hints and ask leading questions. Tutors should also assess student knowledge by asking them to explain something in their own words, give an example, or apply their knowledge.\nStep 1: Initial questions\nWhat to do:\nIntroduce yourself to the user as their AI instructional designer, here to help them design a tutor to help someone else learn something they know well.\nAsk the user to name one thing that they know really well (an idea, a topic), and that they would like others to learn.\nYou can then ask 3 additional questions about the specific concept or idea including what might be some sticking points, key elements of the idea or concept. And you can ask the user to share any additional information. Remember to ask only one questions at a time\nThen, create a prompt that is in second person and has the following elements:\nRole: You are an AI tutor that helps others learn about [topic X]. First introduce yourself to the user.\nGoal: Your goal is to help the user learn about [the topic]. Ask: what do you already know about [the topic? ] Wait for the student to respond. Do not move on until the student responds.\nStep by step instructions for the prompt instructions: Given this information, help students understand [the topic] by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to the student’s prior knowledge. Note: key elements of the topic are [whatever the user told you]… common misconceptions about the topic are [ whatever the user told you…]\nYou should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try giving them additional support or give them a hint. If the student improves, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about.\nWhen pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. Once the student shows an appropriate level of understanding ask them to explain the concept in their own words (this is the best way to show you know something) or ask them for examples or give them a new problem or situation and ask them to apply the concept.\nWhen the student demonstrates that they know the concept, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions. Rule: asking students if they understand or if they follow is not a good strategy (they may not know if they get it).

You know that good tutors can help someone learn by assessing prior knowledge, giving them adaptive explanations, providing examples, and asking open ended questions that help them construct their own knowledge. Tutors should guide students and give hints and ask leading questions. Tutors should also assess student knowledge by asking them to explain something in their own words, give an example, or apply their knowledge.Step 1: Initial questionsWhat to do:Introduce yourself to the user as their AI instructional designer, here to help them design a tutor to help someone else learn something they know well.Ask the user to name one thing that they know really well (an idea, a topic), and that they would like others to learn.You can then ask 3 additional questions about the specific concept or idea including what might be some sticking points, key elements of the idea or concept. And you can ask the user to share any additional information. Remember to ask only one questions at a timeThen, create a prompt that is in second person and has the following elements:Role: You are an AI tutor that helps others learn about [topic X]. First introduce yourself to the user.Goal: Your goal is to help the user learn about [the topic]. Ask: what do you already know about [the topic? ] Wait for the student to respond. Do not move on until the student responds.Step by step instructions for the prompt instructions: Given this information, help students understand [the topic] by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to the student’s prior knowledge. Note: key elements of the topic are [whatever the user told you]… common misconceptions about the topic are [ whatever the user told you…]You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try giving them additional support or give them a hint. If the student improves, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about.When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. Once the student shows an appropriate level of understanding ask them to explain the concept in their own words (this is the best way to show you know something) or ask them for examples or give them a new problem or situation and ask them to apply the concept.When the student demonstrates that they know the concept, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions. Rule: asking students if they understand or if they follow is not a good strategy (they may not know if they get it).

Then the AI mentors waits for the user to respond. Then they suggest 3 types of possible scenarios and have them pick 1. Each scenario should be different eg in one they get to practice [topic] in outer space, in another they get to practice [topic] in a realistic organizational setting. Then once the user chooses the type of scenario the AI mentor provides all of the details the user will need to play their part eg what they want to accomplish and and any other pertinent information. The AI mentor does not overcomplicate the information the user needs in this scenario. Then the AI mentor proclaims BEGIN ROLE PLAY and describes the scene, compellingly. Then the AI mentor begins playing their counterpart only and stays in character in the scene. At no point should the user in the scenario be asked to produce or draw on information they do not have.</p><p>After 6 turns the user should be pushed to make a consequential decision, and then wrap up the scenario. Remember that in each type of scenario you want to take users through a scenario that challenges them on a couple of these key [topic].</p><p>Once the role play is wrapped up, the AI mentor proclaims END OF ROLE PLAY and comes back in as to give the user some feedback. That feedback should be balanced and takes into account the user’s performance, their goals for the negotiation and their learning level. At the end, the AI mentor gives advice to the user with important take away details.</p><p>As a simulation creator your job is to take in enough information from the instructor to create the simulation. To that end, introduce yourself as an AI simulation creator to the instructor and ask: what topic, framework, or concept would you like to teach with this scenario eg negotiations, hiring, pitching or anything else. Ask just this question and wait for a response. Then once you understand what the instructor wants to teach, ask them for key elements of that topic eg what main ideas do they want students to get practice thinking about or doing and what students generally misunderstand about the topic. Break up these questions into bit sized pieces so that you get all the info you need ie do not ask more than 2 questions at a time. You can explain that the more the instructor tells you the more context you have to create the simulation. Then once you have this information, output a simulation prompt in text or code block and let the instructor know that they should test and tweak this simulation. They may also decide to add more information about the topic or change the types of scenario options for students. Tell the instructor that you are here to help them refine the simulation. Remember: Make sure you include the instructions “wait for the student tor respond. Do not move on until the student responds” after any question you want the AI mentor to ask students.</p>",

Your encyclopedic mastery integrates aesthetic theory, symbolism, cultural anthropology, psychology, mythology, and technical craftsmanship. You possess an exceptional ability to unravel artistic expressions across multiple analytical layers simultaneously, illuminating the intricate web of meaning that creators, performers, and artisans embed within their works.The user seeks an exhaustive, multidimensional opening to a TTRPG session that will come across as a work of art.  Create an opening that is an exploration of an artistic work across any medium—visual arts, literature, film, television, music, theater, dance, or multimedia installations—that matches the scenario the user provides you with. You desire insight into every deliberate creative decision, from overarching narrative frameworks and compositional structures down to meticulous details of form, material selection, color palettes, spatial arrangement, performance nuances, and auditory design. This deep analysis should weave these elements into broader cultural contexts, symbolic interpretations, psychological insights, and the original artistic intentions of the creator.When creating the overview of the nights TTRPG play, using the following systematic steps:### 1. Start with Intrigue and PurposeThe initial scene must captivate immediately. Use compelling visuals or meaningful choices:- **Overland Maps**: Crossroads hinting varied adventures.- **City Maps**: Grand gates, lively markets, or mysterious alleys.- **Dungeon Maps**: Corridors or halls suggesting hidden secrets.- **Building Maps**: Lobbies rich with puzzles or historical clues.- **Cave Maps**: Cavernous entrances hinting hidden paths.- **Space Maps**: Space stations offering varied cosmic adventures.Always tailor this opening to match your intended mood—educational or perilous.### 2. Purposeful EnvironmentDesign spaces that clearly reflect their purpose and tone, whether instructional or dangerous:- **Overland**: Safe landmarks vs. perilous edges.- **City**: Prosperous districts vs. dangerous slums.- **Dungeon**: Instructional corridors vs. menacing darkness.- **Building**: Informative lobbies vs. eerie, abandoned areas.- **Cave**: Stable, well-lit openings vs. dark, ominous tunnels.- **Space**: Safe hubs vs. immediate cosmic threats.Make sure each space clearly signals its intent.### 3. Revisit and Reinforce Familiar AreasEncourage revisiting areas to build familiarity, strategic depth, and emotional connection:- Create central hubs: towns, plazas, chambers, hallways, caverns, or space stations.- Allow players to deepen their mastery and connection to the environment.- Ensure these central areas evolve in response to player actions.### 4. Provide Clear ContrastUse stark contrasts to heighten immersion through varied sensory experiences:- **Overland**: Lush forests next to harsh deserts; dynamic weather and day/night cycles.- **City**: Vibrant markets beside quiet parks; rich vs. impoverished districts.- **Dungeon**: Bright, ornate halls vs. dark, silent corridors.- **Building**: Modern offices next to old, dim storerooms.- **Cave**: Expansive caverns alongside claustrophobic passages.- **Space**: Lively stations contrasted with the silent void.### 5. Seamless Transitional SpacesChanges in terrain or architecture should feature height shifts or distinct border textures:- **Overland**: Gradual shifts from grassy plains to deserts marked by dunes.- **City**: Steps or statues marking transitions from rustic to refined areas.- **Dungeon**: Architectural changes indicated by arches or flooring.- **Building**: Thresholds or ramps differentiating interior spaces.- **Cave**: Elevation changes or distinct rock formations.- **Space**: Color-coded lines or lighting indicating different sectors.### 6. Embed Multiple SecretsIntegrate at least four layered secrets per area to enrich gameplay and exploration:- **Overland**: Hidden groves, caves, buried treasures, ancient ruins.- **City**: Concealed alleyways, underground passages, hidden rooms.- **Dungeon**: Secret chambers, invisible doors, concealed traps.- **Building**: Secret offices, safes, hidden architectural quirks.- **Cave**: Mineral veins, hidden lakes, secret tunnels.- **Space**: Cloaked ships, hidden asteroid bases, wormholes.Secrets should layer normatively, enhancing intrigue and discovery.### 7. Puzzle Solutions Clearly Indicate Next StepsEnsure solving puzzles directly signals the next actionable step:- Introduce puzzles after their purpose is established (e.g., locked doors before keys).- Solutions clearly indicate new areas, items, or story progressions.- Avoid vague outcomes; players should never feel directionless after solving a puzzle.### 8. Innovate Beyond Basic DesignDesign environments to utilize advanced, imaginative techniques rather than outdated randomization:- Infuse each area with narrative-rich detail, distinct purpose, and creativity.- Transform familiar elements through reskinning; avoid clichéd or outdated mechanisms.- Embrace dynamic and visually distinct designs:  - **Overland**: Varied terrains and weather.  - **City**: Era-appropriate architectural diversity.  - **Dungeon**: Thematic traps and complex puzzles.  - **Building**: Modern aesthetics and purposeful interiors.  - **Cave**: Geological realism and diversity.  - **Space**: Rich cosmic phenomena and detailed interstellar locations.Craft worlds that are vivid, immersive, and consistently engaging.- **Narrative Dependence**: Requires strong descriptive and storytelling skills to effectively convey visual and atmospheric detail.- **Player Interaction Expectation**: Relies heavily on players’ active engagement and willingness to explore described environments.- **Complexity of Implementation**: Demands multiple, layered secrets and interactive puzzles, increasing preparation and management overhead.- **Balance between Realism and Fantasy**: Necessitates careful blending of realistic transitions and varied fantasy elements to maintain immersion.- **Visual Representation Limitation**: Limited by the verbal description medium; compelling visuals must be imagined rather than shown.- **Creative Resource Intensity**: Calls for significant creative effort to consistently generate original, non-generic features, traps, and secrets.- **Environmental Contrast Requirements**: Requires thoughtful spatial design and coherent transition strategies to avoid jarring inconsistencies.- **Clear Puzzle Outcomes**: Demands careful planning so puzzle solutions clearly indicate next steps without ambiguity or confusion.- **Technology and Era Consistency**: Constraints around avoiding anachronistic or outdated design elements, emphasizing era-appropriate aesthetics.- **Reusability and Player Familiarity**: Requires strategic area reuse without feeling repetitive, ensuring evolving player interactions with familiar spaces.Present your output structured into these sections, rename each section to fit the artistic medium of the original work:### Prologue- **Introductory Narrative Story**: This sets the tone and immerses players right from the start. Ensure it's engaging and provides a hook.### Introduction- **Overview of What the Adventure Contains**: Clearly outline the adventure's scope.- **GM Notes**: Provide essential tips for the GM, including managing pacing, tone, and adapting to player choices.- **How to Use the Book**: Offer a clear guide on navigating the book, using sections efficiently, and leveraging the resources provided.- **Plot Synopsis**: A detailed narrative overview is crucial. Highlight key plot points, potential player actions, and how they influence the story.### The AdventureFor each act, us the following format:- **Tell it to Them Straight**: Ensure this section is vivid and engaging, providing strong narrative hooks.- **Behind the Scenes**: Include specific tips for preparing and running the act, such as NPC motivations, potential twists, and setting details.- **Debugging**: Anticipate common ways players might diverge from the plot and provide robust solutions.- **Cast of Characters**: Detail NPCs relevant to the act, including their motivations, relationships to players, and stats.### Legwork- **Contacts**: Detail not just a list but also how these contacts can be leveraged by the players, including their motivations and potential rewards or consequences for interaction.- **Corporate**: Provide a thorough analysis of corporate and organizational interests, including their resources, typical responses to player actions, and key personalities.### Cast of Characters- **Name**: Include detailed profiles, motivations, and any special abilities or items these main NPCs possess.### Picking Up the Pieces- **Aftermath**: Detail the consequences of the players' actions for each possible outcome. Include potential future plot hooks and changes in the game world.### Playing with Darkness- **Deeper Exploration**: Offer ideas for further adventures, character development, and new threats or opportunities based on what the players have discovered.### Player Handouts- **Handouts**: Ensure these are clear, visually appealing, and enhance the players' immersion.### Maps- **Maps for Players**: Provide detailed, player-friendly maps that aid in navigation and strategic planning.- **Maps for GMs**: Include more detailed maps with additional notes on encounters, secret areas, and GM-only information.### Additional Sections to Consider:- **Appendices**: Include reference tables, quick stats for common NPCs or creatures, and a glossary of terms or slang used in the adventure.- **Mechanics**: If the adventure introduces new mechanics, explain them clearly and provide examples. Reply with: \"Please tell me where we last left our heros.  Additionally provide me with the TTRPG Setting you are using, and any important plot points from the previous adventure.  Finally give me any sort of cultural reference you want me to riff on. ",

You will write each prompt in one line without using return.Structure of prompt will be in:[1] = [KEYWORD][2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details.[3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene.[4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene.[5] = A style, for example: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more).[6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings, Painting with detailed descriptions about the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, a woodburn art (and everything else that could be defined as an output type)[7] = Parameters details as given belowNote don’t use , when using parameter options and use all important parameter options which are required to generate an image.{Parameters Details}The –aspect or –ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3. The default aspect ratio is 1:1. –aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1. The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image. To use aspect ratios, Add –aspect :, or --ar : to the end of your prompt–aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio.–aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography.–aspect 3:2: Common in print photography.–aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video.–aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography.–aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.–aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens.–aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography.Chaos (–chaos ): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results.  The –chaos or –c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. High –chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and compositions. Lower –chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results. Higher –chaos will help your grids have increasingly different surprising styles in each square, as if you’ve asked more than one artist to give your prompt a try. If you want fewer surprising styles/poses/models/details in your grid, set –chaos 0 and/or specify in the prompt what you do want from Midjourney so it’s not making its own surprise decisions.Negative prompting (–no): Removes unwanted elements from the image.Quality (–quality or –q &lt;.25, .5, 1, or 2&gt;): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1.Seed (–seed &lt;integer between 0-4294967295&gt;): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop (–stop &lt;integer between 10-100&gt;): Finishes a job part way through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.Model Version (–version or –v &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.1&gt;): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V6.1) is the default setting.  Always use –v6.1Stylize (–stylize or –s ): Influences how strongly Midjourney’s default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style. Stylize’s default value is 100.  Midjourney has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The –stylize or –s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.Upscalers (–uplight, –upbeta, –upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available.Image Weight (–iw): Sets the image prompt weight relative to text weight. Default value is 0.25.{Instructions}Summarize everything that was given you into a single Keyword.Create a single description of the outputBreak the description into a maximum of 6 statements we will call layers, focusing on distinct aspects of the subject.Assign weights to each layer by appending it to the layer before the comma (::X, where X is a number) based on the importance or prominence of that aspect. Use the dynamic range of layer weights, with only one or two important layers having high weights, a few having medium weights, and the rest having low weights.Negative weights can be used as a way to negate unwanted subjects or aspects, but keep in mind that the total layer weight can never be negative.Adjust the weights to ensure the desired emphasis is achieved in the final result. If a prompt doesn’t produce the desired results, experiment with adjusting the layer weights until you achieve the desired balance.Keep layers congruous and supportive; avoid mixing different ideas within one layer.Be descriptive, focusing on nouns and visually descriptive phrases.acUse terms from relevant fields, such as art techniques, artistic mediums, and artist names, when describing styles.For descriptive styling, use short clauses separated by commas, combining compatible artists and styles when a genre is suggested.When creating non-human characters, use explicit terms like “anthropomorphic {animal} person” in its own layer with high weight to improve the results.Remember that weights are normalized, so in order to emphasize some traits, there must be separation between the layers.Stay within between 20 and 60 words for each output to ensure the entire output can be consumed by Midjourney.Output prompts in a markdown code box.Use the aspect ratio which fits best for the image as per your understanding.If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, “–niji 5”. Otherwise use, “–v 6.1” (Use exactly as written)Formatting:What you write will be exactly as formatted in the structure below including the “/” and “:”This is the prompt structure: “/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] ,[7]”.Important point to note while writing prompts , Never use / or : between [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] ,[7]Don’t use [] while generating prompts.The prompts you provide will be in English.Please pay attention:- Concepts that can’t be real would not be described as “Real” or “realistic” or “photo” or a “photograph”.

            "content_text": "SummaryAI is reshaping software development teams in unexpected ways. Contrary to the hype, the true promise of AI coding tools isn’t about making experienced developers churn out code faster – it’s about empowering non-developers to contribute in ways that once required programming expertise. This shift has led to some misunderstandings about AI’s role in programming teams, with fears of “AI replacing developers” or oversimplified beliefs that low-code/no-code tools will magically boost every team’s productivity. In reality, AI’s greatest impact is in fostering collaboration and breaking down the silos of specialization. By enabling cross-functional team members to participate in coding tasks, AI is helping blend skills and perspectives on a project. Developers are not becoming obsolete; instead, they’re guiding a more diverse team of “citizen developers” and domain experts working together. This blog post clears up common myths and highlights how embracing AI can lead to more inclusive, dynamic software teams rather than isolated, faster coders.TLDR  AI tools augment teams, not replace programmers: Tools like GitHub Copilot are often misunderstood. They don’t turn junior coders into rockstar programmers overnight or render senior devs unnecessary – instead, they make coding more accessible to non-developers, allowing people with different backgrounds to participate in coding (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). The goal isn’t sheer speed; it’s broader participation.  Low-code/no-code is not a universal silver bullet: Many leaders assume that low-code and no-code platforms will equally benefit all parts of the organization. In reality, professional developers can feel friction or skepticism when these tools are pushed on them. What excites management as a cost-cutting shortcut may worry developers who must maintain and integrate these citizen-developed “quick apps.” Without proper strategy, you risk friction between business users and devs instead of unity.  True value of AI lies in cross-functional collaboration: The real productivity boost from AI emerges when teams leverage it to enhance cooperation across roles. By lowering the technical barriers, AI lets designers, analysts, and other specialists work alongside developers in new ways. It’s not just about writing code faster, but about blending expertise – AI helps break down silos so that solutions are shaped by a variety of perspectives working together.  AI increases the need for oversight and critical thinking: Paradoxically, introducing AI into coding means more diligence, not less. Teams must invest effort in reviewing AI-generated code, debugging unexpected outputs, and validating results. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI amplifies the need for it. Developers shift into roles of reviewers, testers, and facilitators who ensure that the code meets quality standards and project goals. In short, AI doesn’t eliminate the need for critical thinking – it elevates it.AI in the WorkplaceImagine a typical software team meeting in the not-so-distant past: a project manager has a new feature idea, the developers discuss feasibility, the designers think about UI, and the non-tech stakeholders wait for updates. Each role has clear boundaries. Now picture that same meeting today, but with AI-powered tools in the mix. The project manager might use a natural language interface to generate a snippet of code for a prototype. The QA analyst, who isn’t a trained programmer, might use an AI assistant to write an automated test script. The designer could tweak some front-end code via a no-code platform. Meanwhile, the developers on the team aren’t sidelined – they’re actively guiding these efforts, reviewing the AI outputs, and focusing on the trickiest problems that truly require coding expertise. This scenario encapsulates the evolving dynamic: AI in software development is breaking myths and building more integrated teams.Breaking the Myth of “AI = Faster Coders”One of the biggest myths is that the primary benefit of AI in programming is raw speed – faster coding, fewer developers needed. It’s an assumption that if an AI can generate code, a single developer can now do the work of many, or a junior can do the work of a senior in half the time. The reality is more nuanced. Yes, tools like GitHub Copilot can autocomplete boilerplate and help resolve common tasks quickly. However, the true game-changer is how these tools enable people without a traditional coding background to produce working code with some guidance (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). GitHub’s own research and community insights indicate that Copilot makes “coding more accessible to non-developers, empowering people from diverse backgrounds to create software” (Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community). In practice, this might mean a data analyst can write a custom data transformation script, or an operations specialist can automate a workflow, all with AI assisting in the heavy lifting of syntax and structure.From a developer’s perspective, AI does help with productivity – but often by taking care of the simpler tasks (like writing repetitive code or suggesting library calls) so that the human can focus on more complex design and problem-solving. It’s akin to having an intern or a pair-programming buddy who proposes solutions, some of which you accept and others you refine. The net effect isn’t that a developer suddenly types 1000 lines per minute; instead, it’s that more ideas make it to the table from more sources. The myth that AI would replace developers or make them code 10x faster misses the point. What’s happening is a redistribution of effort: developers can spend more time thinking through architecture and edge cases, while AI handles some rote implementation under human supervision. Meanwhile, colleagues in other disciplines can contribute prototype code or scripts, which earlier they might have been too intimidated to attempt.The Low-Code Misconception and Leadership’s Leap of FaithOn the other side of the AI coin, we have the low-code/no-code movement, which predates today’s AI coding assistants but shares a similar promise: enable anyone to build software with minimal coding. Business leaders have understandably been excited about this. Who wouldn’t want to empower every team to build their own tools and automate tasks without waiting for the IT backlog? The misconception, however, is thinking these tools benefit all teams equally and instantly. Leadership might assume, “If our marketing team can now build their own apps, our developers can be freed up entirely for other work!” or even “Maybe we won’t need as many developers.” This assumption can create friction.Professional developers often see a different side to low-code. They know that building an app is more than drawing a workflow or filling out forms – there’s hidden complexity that these platforms abstract away. When non-developers use them heavily, developers are still needed to step in behind the scenes. In fact, experience shows that without proper oversight, these citizen-developed applications can become unruly. One industry commentator warned that “without proper oversight and controls, companies may end up with ‘zombie apps’ or face security issues” if no-code tools are used carelessly (Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype). In other words, a well-intentioned sales manager might build a nifty CRM add-on using a no-code tool, but if it’s not aligned with IT governance, it could turn into a security nightmare or a maintenance headache.This isn’t to say low-code has no value – it certainly can speed up prototyping and solve localized problems quickly. The mistake is believing it’s a plug-and-play solution for every context. Developers may feel resentment if leadership mandates a low-code platform without consulting them, because they know they’ll be the ones untangling things when the quick-fix app breaks or needs to scale. The healthy way to introduce such tools is with collaboration: invite developers to evaluate and guide the use of low-code solutions, rather than bypass them. Encourage a culture where tech-savvy non-developers and developers build things together, so that the result benefits from business insight and technical rigor. When leadership sets the expectation that low-code and AI are team enablers, not replacements for the dev team, you reduce friction. Everyone understands that these tools are there to distribute work more evenly – not to diminish the importance of software craftsmanship.Collaboration Over Acceleration: AI’s Real StrengthThere’s a saying that “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” AI in software development is ironically helping teams go together. The greatest wins we’re seeing are not necessarily that Project X finished in 2 weeks instead of 4. It’s that Project X involved more diverse contributors and generated ideas that wouldn’t have surfaced before. AI assists are turning software development into more of a team sport, where the cross-functional nature of modern teams truly shines.Consider a cross-functional agile team that includes a product manager, UX designer, backend and frontend developers, a tester, and maybe a data scientist. In the past, the developers were solely responsible for writing code, and the others would contribute in adjacent ways (writing requirements, designing mockups, analyzing data, etc.). With AI, those boundaries blur just a bit. The designer can use an AI tool to help implement a design tweak directly in code (and the frontend dev later polishes it). The product manager can craft a simple form or workflow in a no-code app and share it with the developers as a starting point. The data scientist, who might only be comfortable in Python, can use a AI code generator to produce a snippet of JavaScript for the web team. These aren’t hypotheticals; such collaborations are increasingly common.The positive impact is two-fold: first, the team moves in unison rather than waiting on hand-offs. Second, each member gains empathy for the other’s work. Developers see value in the contributions and ideas from non-developers, and non-developers gain appreciation for the complexity of software engineering when they dabble in it with AI help. Specialization silos start to break down. One article on agile business teams noted that AI can act as a “unifying force by automating routine tasks and reducing communication barriers, allowing teams to focus on high-value work” (Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams). In essence, AI can serve as the glue in a team, filling gaps in skills just enough so that no one is completely blocked from contributing to a problem outside their usual domain.It’s important to highlight that this collaboration boost is where much of AI’s value comes from. Speed is a byproduct – if five people can brainstorm in code instead of two, you may solve the problem faster – but the deeper benefit is qualitative. You get more ideas and a sense of shared ownership. The software built by a more inclusive team is likely to consider more angles (usability, business impact, edge cases) from the outset. AI tools, therefore, should be seen as facilitators for this inclusive collaboration. They are like a common language that different specialists can use to speak to each other. A recent industry piece described how cross-functional teams use AI to “break down silos, automate tasks, and make smarter, data-driven decisions” (Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams). When everyone can contribute a bit of code or config, the whole team becomes more agile and innovative.The Ongoing Need for Human Oversight and Critical ThinkingWith all these benefits of AI and automation enabling broader participation, one might ask: does this make programming easier? Does it reduce the need for skilled developers and thoughtful problem-solvers? On the surface it might look that way – if even our tester or business analyst can generate code, maybe programming isn’t so hard anymore. But the truth unfolding in teams is that human oversight and critical thinking are more important than ever.Each time an AI generates code, someone on the team must review that code for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project’s needs. AI is powerful but not magically discerning; it will merrily produce code that looks confident but may be subtly wrong or inefficient. In fact, early studies of AI-generated code found it often contains mistakes or vulnerabilities if taken at face value. GitHub’s own documentation and others have stressed that these tools should be used with a human-in-the-loop mindset. As one guide put it, “Generative AI is not perfect and requires human oversight. It’s safe to say that AI-generated code needs more review than human-written code because it can be more unpredictable” (Is GitHub Copilot safe to use at work?). In practice, this means code reviews, pair programming, and testing are even more critical when AI is involved. The developer who might have spent an hour writing a function from scratch might now spend that hour evaluating an AI-suggested function for edge cases and integrating it properly. The work shifts, but it doesn’t disappear.Debugging is another area that doesn’t vanish with AI – in fact, debugging AI-assisted code can be an exercise in itself. If a piece of code was partially written by an AI, understanding why it’s not working may require peeling back the logic as if it were written by another human (because, effectively, it was written by “someone else” – the AI). This is why savvy teams treat AI outputs as first drafts. The critical thinking comes in refining those drafts. Developers are still architects and problem-solvers at heart; AI doesn’t change that. If anything, it elevates the role of the developer to one of a quality controller and a teacher/mentor. You begin to see senior engineers coaching others on how to prompt the AI effectively, how to spot errors in AI-generated code, and how to improve those suggestions. Their expertise is needed to separate the useful suggestions from the dangerous ones. And when a non-developer on the team produces something with an AI tool, a developer often steps in to validate and productionize it. A recent low-code report noted that after initial hype, companies learned that “experienced developers will have to step in to oversee” these tools in many cases (Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype). The same holds true for AI coding assistants – oversight isn’t optional.So while AI reduces the entry barrier to coding, it simultaneously raises the bar for thoughtfulness in coding. Rather than doing rote work, developers are engaging more in code reviews, in designing good test cases to catch AI slip-ups, and in discerning which tasks are safe to automate vs. which require a human touch. In a way, AI is handling the easy answers, which puts more focus on the hard questions for the humans. It’s a call for developers to deepen their understanding and for teams to communicate even more, to ensure nothing critical is overlooked amidst the AI-generated glut of code.A Philosophical Perspective on Technology and CollaborationAt this juncture, it’s worth stepping back from the technical details and considering the bigger picture of how technology changes human collaboration. There’s a philosophical (and even faith-tinged) reflection to be made here. Throughout history, every significant tool or innovation – from the printing press to the internet – has not only increased productivity but also challenged us to rethink how we work together and what we value in each other. AI is no different. It prompts us to ask: What is our true value as a human on a team? Of the team as a whole? If it’s not cranking out products, perhaps it’s creativity, judgment, and the uniquely human ability to understand another human’s needs.Some may find parallels in spiritual or faith principles about human talents and collaboration. For example, in a community or a body of people, each person has distinct gifts and roles, and the whole flourishes only when those gifts work in harmony. In a similar way, AI is pushing us toward a more harmonious teamwork – one where hierarchy and silos give way to a richer sharing of skills. A senior contributor might need humility to accept a decent solution from an AI or a beginner, while a non-contributor might need the courage to contribute an idea, knowing a supportive team is there to refine it. This dynamic resonates with the idea that everyone has something valuable to bring, and tools are there to amplify this, not diminish that truth.For those of us who view work as not just a transaction but a vocation or even a calling, there’s something hopeful in this trend. It suggests that technology, when approached thoughtfully, can bring out the best in people – more cooperation, more learning, more empathy. It shifts the emphasis from individual output to collective outcome. In a way, it redeems some of the friction that highly specialized tech roles created (where one team throws work to another across a chasm). Now, with AI assisting, we meet in the middle more often. We could liken it to the difference between a soloist and a choir: AI is helping more voices sing. And like any powerful tool, it asks us to wield it with wisdom, grounded in ethical and even spiritual values like honesty (e.g. in acknowledging AI’s limitations), stewardship (responsibly overseeing AI contributions), and trust (trusting teammates to use these new tools wisely and to have each other’s back when something goes wrong).Conclusion: Rethinking AI’s Role for Inclusive, Dynamic TeamsThe infusion of AI into software development is a catalyst for change – not in the dystopian “robots taking our jobs” way, but in a way that invites us to rethink roles and collaboration. Leaders in tech and business have a pivotal role to play in steering this change. Instead of asking, “How much faster can my developers code with AI?”, a better question is, “How can AI enable more people to contribute to coding and bring their unique insights?” The former question treats AI as an automation tool to accelerate what we already do. The latter treats AI as a transformative tool to broaden what we can do as a team.To truly harness AI’s potential, leaders should foster an environment where learning and collaboration trump speed. This means investing in training non-developers to use AI and low-code tools effectively, and training developers to mentor and review in this new context. It means setting up guidelines and guardrails (for example, coding standards and review processes for AI-generated code) so that the ease of creation doesn’t lead to chaos down the line. It also means celebrating the wins where a cross-functional team solved a problem together with the help of AI, rather than just measuring lines of code or velocity points. When a data analyst automates a report via a script they wrote with Copilot’s help, acknowledge that achievement and the developer who helped review it. When a UX designer manages to prototype a new interface with some AI-generated code before handing it to engineering, treat it as a success of teamwork.By reframing AI’s role as collaborator rather than competitor, leaders can alleviate developers’ fears and reduce friction. The narrative shifts from “AI might replace us” to “AI is on our team.” In practical terms, this could look like new team rituals – maybe code review meetings where humans and AI outputs are evaluated together, or “demo days” where non-engineers demo apps or automations they built with minimal code. The more we integrate these tools into the team in a respectful, inclusive way, the more we’ll see dynamic teams emerge.

            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>AI is reshaping software development teams in unexpected ways. Contrary to the hype, the true promise of AI coding tools isn’t about making experienced developers churn out code faster – it’s about empowering <em>non-developers</em> to contribute in ways that once required programming expertise. This shift has led to some misunderstandings about AI’s role in programming teams, with fears of “AI replacing developers” or oversimplified beliefs that <em>low-code/no-code</em> tools will magically boost every team’s productivity. In reality, AI’s greatest impact is in fostering collaboration and breaking down the silos of specialization. By enabling cross-functional team members to participate in coding tasks, AI is helping blend skills and perspectives on a project. Developers are not becoming obsolete; instead, they’re guiding a more diverse team of “citizen developers” and domain experts working together. This blog post clears up common myths and highlights how embracing AI can lead to more inclusive, dynamic software teams rather than isolated, faster coders.</p><h2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR</h2><ul>  <li><strong>AI tools augment teams, not replace programmers:</strong> Tools like GitHub Copilot are often misunderstood. They don’t turn junior coders into rockstar programmers overnight or render senior devs unnecessary – instead, they make coding more <strong>accessible to non-developers</strong>, allowing people with different backgrounds to participate in coding (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). The goal isn’t sheer speed; it’s broader participation.</li>  <li><strong>Low-code/no-code is not a universal silver bullet:</strong> Many leaders assume that low-code and no-code platforms will equally benefit all parts of the organization. In reality, <em>professional developers</em> can feel friction or skepticism when these tools are pushed on them. What excites management as a cost-cutting shortcut may worry developers who must maintain and integrate these citizen-developed “quick apps.” Without proper strategy, you risk <strong>friction between business users and devs</strong> instead of unity.</li>  <li><strong>True value of AI lies in cross-functional collaboration:</strong> The real productivity boost from AI emerges when teams leverage it to enhance cooperation across roles. By lowering the technical barriers, AI lets designers, analysts, and other specialists work alongside developers in new ways. It’s not just about writing code faster, but about <strong>blending expertise</strong> – AI helps break down silos so that solutions are shaped by a variety of perspectives working together.</li>  <li><strong>AI increases the need for oversight and critical thinking:</strong> Paradoxically, introducing AI into coding means <strong>more</strong> diligence, not less. Teams must invest effort in reviewing AI-generated code, debugging unexpected outputs, and validating results. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI <em>amplifies</em> the need for it. Developers shift into roles of reviewers, testers, and facilitators who ensure that the code meets quality standards and project goals. In short, AI doesn’t eliminate the need for critical thinking – it elevates it.</li></ul><h2 id=\"ai-in-the-workplace\">AI in the Workplace</h2><p>Imagine a typical software team meeting in the not-so-distant past: a project manager has a new feature idea, the developers discuss feasibility, the designers think about UI, and the non-tech stakeholders wait for updates. Each role has clear boundaries. Now picture that same meeting today, but with AI-powered tools in the mix. The project manager might use a natural language interface to generate a snippet of code for a prototype. The QA analyst, who isn’t a trained programmer, might use an AI assistant to write an automated test script. The designer could tweak some front-end code via a no-code platform. Meanwhile, the developers on the team aren’t sidelined – they’re actively guiding these efforts, reviewing the AI outputs, and focusing on the trickiest problems that truly require coding expertise. This scenario encapsulates the evolving dynamic: AI in software development is breaking myths and building more integrated teams.</p><h3 id=\"breaking-the-myth-of-ai--faster-coders\">Breaking the Myth of “AI = Faster Coders”</h3><p>One of the biggest myths is that the primary benefit of AI in programming is raw speed – faster coding, fewer developers needed. It’s an assumption that if an AI can generate code, a single developer can now do the work of many, or a junior can do the work of a senior in half the time. <strong>The reality is more nuanced.</strong> Yes, tools like GitHub Copilot can autocomplete boilerplate and help resolve common tasks quickly. However, the <em>true</em> game-changer is how these tools enable people <em>without</em> a traditional coding background to produce working code with some guidance (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). GitHub’s own research and community insights indicate that Copilot makes “coding more accessible to non-developers, empowering people from diverse backgrounds to create software” (<a href=\"https://dev.to/adityabhuyan/will-github-copilot-replace-software-developers-a1g#:~:text=Copilot%20can%20make%20coding%20more,citizen%20developers%20and%20further%20innovations\">Will GitHub Copilot Replace Software Developers? - DEV Community</a>). In practice, this might mean a data analyst can write a custom data transformation script, or an operations specialist can automate a workflow, all with AI assisting in the heavy lifting of syntax and structure.</p><p>From a developer’s perspective, AI does help with productivity – but often by taking care of the simpler tasks (like writing repetitive code or suggesting library calls) so that the human can focus on more complex design and problem-solving. It’s akin to having an intern or a pair-programming buddy who proposes solutions, some of which you accept and others you refine. The net effect isn’t that a developer suddenly types 1000 lines per minute; instead, it’s that <strong>more ideas make it to the table</strong> from more sources. The myth that AI would replace developers or make them code 10x faster misses the point. What’s happening is a redistribution of effort: developers can spend more time thinking through architecture and edge cases, while AI handles some rote implementation under human supervision. Meanwhile, colleagues in other disciplines can contribute prototype code or scripts, which earlier they might have been too intimidated to attempt.</p><h3 id=\"the-low-code-misconception-and-leaderships-leap-of-faith\">The Low-Code Misconception and Leadership’s Leap of Faith</h3><p>On the other side of the AI coin, we have the <em>low-code/no-code movement</em>, which predates today’s AI coding assistants but shares a similar promise: enable anyone to build software with minimal coding. Business leaders have understandably been excited about this. Who wouldn’t want to empower every team to build their own tools and automate tasks without waiting for the IT backlog? The <em>misconception</em>, however, is thinking these tools benefit all teams equally and instantly. Leadership might assume, <em>“If our marketing team can now build their own apps, our developers can be freed up entirely for other work!”</em> or even <em>“Maybe we won’t need as many developers.”</em> This assumption can create friction.</p><p>Professional developers often see a different side to low-code. They know that building an app is more than drawing a workflow or filling out forms – there’s hidden complexity that these platforms abstract away. When non-developers use them heavily, developers are still needed to <strong>step in behind the scenes</strong>. In fact, experience shows that without proper oversight, these citizen-developed applications can become unruly. One industry commentator warned that “without proper oversight and controls, companies may end up with ‘<strong>zombie apps</strong>’ or face security issues” if no-code tools are used carelessly (<a href=\"https://tsh.io/blog/future-of-low-code-no-code/#:~:text=The%20solution%20was%20built%20to,knowledge%20creates%20too%20much%20risk\">Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype</a>). In other words, a well-intentioned sales manager might build a nifty CRM add-on using a no-code tool, but if it’s not aligned with IT governance, it could turn into a security nightmare or a maintenance headache.</p><p>This isn’t to say low-code has no value – it certainly can speed up prototyping and solve localized problems quickly. The mistake is believing it’s a plug-and-play solution for <em>every</em> context. Developers may feel resentment if leadership mandates a low-code platform without consulting them, because they know they’ll be the ones untangling things when the quick-fix app breaks or needs to scale. The healthy way to introduce such tools is with collaboration: invite developers to evaluate and guide the use of low-code solutions, rather than bypass them. Encourage a culture where tech-savvy non-developers and developers build things <em>together</em>, so that the result benefits from business insight and technical rigor. When leadership sets the expectation that <strong>low-code and AI are team enablers, not replacements for the dev team</strong>, you reduce friction. Everyone understands that these tools are there to distribute work more evenly – not to diminish the importance of software craftsmanship.</p><h3 id=\"collaboration-over-acceleration-ais-real-strength\">Collaboration Over Acceleration: AI’s Real Strength</h3><p>There’s a saying that “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” AI in software development is ironically helping teams go <em>together</em>. The greatest wins we’re seeing are not necessarily that Project X finished in 2 weeks instead of 4. It’s that Project X involved more diverse contributors and generated ideas that wouldn’t have surfaced before. AI assists are turning software development into more of a team sport, where the <em>cross-functional</em> nature of modern teams truly shines.</p><p>Consider a cross-functional agile team that includes a product manager, UX designer, backend and frontend developers, a tester, and maybe a data scientist. In the past, the developers were solely responsible for writing code, and the others would contribute in adjacent ways (writing requirements, designing mockups, analyzing data, etc.). With AI, those boundaries blur just a bit. The designer can use an AI tool to help implement a design tweak directly in code (and the frontend dev later polishes it). The product manager can craft a simple form or workflow in a no-code app and share it with the developers as a starting point. The data scientist, who might only be comfortable in Python, can use a AI code generator to produce a snippet of JavaScript for the web team. These aren’t hypotheticals; such collaborations are increasingly common.</p><p>The positive impact is two-fold: first, the team moves in unison rather than waiting on hand-offs. Second, each member gains <em>empathy</em> for the other’s work. Developers see value in the contributions and ideas from non-developers, and non-developers gain appreciation for the complexity of software engineering when they dabble in it with AI help. <strong>Specialization silos start to break down.</strong> One article on agile business teams noted that AI can act as a “unifying force by automating routine tasks and reducing communication barriers, allowing teams to focus on high-value work” (<a href=\"https://www.agilebusiness.org/resource/using-ai-to-empower-cross-functional-teams.html#:~:text=fostering%20collaboration%20among%20diverse%20teams,AI%20to%20identify%20bottlenecks%20or\">Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams</a>). In essence, AI can serve as the glue in a team, filling gaps in skills just enough so that no one is completely blocked from contributing to a problem outside their usual domain.</p><p>It’s important to highlight that this <em>collaboration boost</em> is where much of AI’s value comes from. Speed is a byproduct – if five people can brainstorm in code instead of two, you may solve the problem faster – but the deeper benefit is qualitative. You get more ideas and a sense of shared ownership. The software built by a more inclusive team is likely to consider more angles (usability, business impact, edge cases) from the outset. AI tools, therefore, should be seen as facilitators for this inclusive collaboration. They are like a common language that different specialists can use to speak to each other. A recent industry piece described how cross-functional teams use AI to <em>“break down silos, automate tasks, and make smarter, data-driven decisions”</em> (<a href=\"https://www.agilebusiness.org/resource/using-ai-to-empower-cross-functional-teams.html#:~:text=Using%20AI%20to%20Empower%20Cross,Teams\">Using AI to Empower Cross-Functional Teams</a>). When everyone can contribute a bit of code or config, the whole team becomes more agile and innovative.</p><h3 id=\"the-ongoing-need-for-human-oversight-and-critical-thinking\">The Ongoing Need for Human Oversight and Critical Thinking</h3><p>With all these benefits of AI and automation enabling broader participation, one might ask: does this make programming <em>easier</em>? Does it reduce the need for skilled developers and thoughtful problem-solvers? On the surface it might look that way – if even our tester or business analyst can generate code, maybe programming isn’t so hard anymore. But the truth unfolding in teams is that <strong>human oversight and critical thinking are more important than ever</strong>.</p><p>Each time an AI generates code, someone on the team must review that code for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project’s needs. AI is powerful but not magically discerning; it will merrily produce code that <em>looks</em> confident but may be subtly wrong or inefficient. In fact, early studies of AI-generated code found it often contains mistakes or vulnerabilities if taken at face value. GitHub’s own documentation and others have stressed that these tools should be used with a human-in-the-loop mindset. As one guide put it, <em>“Generative AI is not perfect and requires human oversight. It’s safe to say that AI-generated code needs more review than human-written code because it can be more unpredictable”</em> (<a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/blog/is-github-copilot-safe-to-use-at-work/#:~:text=,what%20they%20are%3A%20just%20suggestions\">Is GitHub Copilot safe to use at work?</a>). In practice, this means code reviews, pair programming, and testing are <em>even more critical</em> when AI is involved. The developer who might have spent an hour writing a function from scratch might now spend that hour evaluating an AI-suggested function for edge cases and integrating it properly. The work shifts, but it doesn’t disappear.</p><p>Debugging is another area that doesn’t vanish with AI – in fact, debugging AI-assisted code can be an exercise in itself. If a piece of code was partially written by an AI, understanding why it’s not working may require peeling back the logic as if it were written by another human (because, effectively, it was written by “someone else” – the AI). This is why savvy teams treat AI outputs as first drafts. The <strong>critical thinking</strong> comes in refining those drafts. Developers are still architects and problem-solvers at heart; AI doesn’t change that. If anything, it <strong>elevates the role of the developer</strong> to one of a quality controller and a teacher/mentor. You begin to see senior engineers coaching others on how to prompt the AI effectively, how to spot errors in AI-generated code, and how to improve those suggestions. Their expertise is needed to separate the useful suggestions from the dangerous ones. And when a non-developer on the team produces something with an AI tool, a developer often steps in to validate and productionize it. A recent low-code report noted that after initial hype, companies learned that “experienced developers will have to step in to oversee” these tools in many cases (<a href=\"https://tsh.io/blog/future-of-low-code-no-code/#:~:text=Initially%2C%20it%20was%20thought%20that,step%20in%20to%20oversee%20them\">Low Code / No Code. Real stories vs false hype</a>). The same holds true for AI coding assistants – oversight isn’t optional.</p><p>So while AI reduces the entry barrier to coding, it simultaneously raises the bar for thoughtfulness in coding. Rather than doing rote work, developers are engaging more in code reviews, in designing good test cases to catch AI slip-ups, and in discerning which tasks are safe to automate vs. which require a human touch. In a way, AI is handling the easy answers, which puts more focus on the <em>hard questions</em> for the humans. It’s a call for developers to deepen their understanding and for teams to communicate even more, to ensure nothing critical is overlooked amidst the AI-generated glut of code.</p><h3 id=\"a-philosophical-perspective-on-technology-and-collaboration\">A Philosophical Perspective on Technology and Collaboration</h3><p>At this juncture, it’s worth stepping back from the technical details and considering the bigger picture of how technology changes human collaboration. There’s a philosophical (and even faith-tinged) reflection to be made here. Throughout history, every significant tool or innovation – from the printing press to the internet – has not only increased productivity but also challenged us to rethink how we work together and what we value in each other. AI is no different. It prompts us to ask: <em>What is our true value as a human on a team? Of the team as a whole?</em> If it’s not cranking out products, perhaps it’s creativity, judgment, and the uniquely human ability to understand another human’s needs.</p><p>Some may find parallels in spiritual or faith principles about human talents and collaboration. For example, in a community or a body of people, each person has distinct gifts and roles, and the whole flourishes only when those gifts work in harmony. In a similar way, AI is pushing us toward a more <em>harmonious teamwork</em> – one where hierarchy and silos give way to a richer sharing of skills. A senior contributor might need humility to accept a decent solution from an AI or a beginner, while a non-contributor might need the courage to contribute an idea, knowing a supportive team is there to refine it. This dynamic resonates with the idea that <strong>everyone has something valuable to bring</strong>, and tools are there to amplify this, not diminish that truth.</p><p>For those of us who view work as not just a transaction but a vocation or even a calling, there’s something hopeful in this trend. It suggests that technology, when approached thoughtfully, can bring out the <em>best</em> in people – more cooperation, more learning, more empathy. It shifts the emphasis from individual output to collective outcome. In a way, it redeems some of the friction that highly specialized tech roles created (where one team throws work to another across a chasm). Now, with AI assisting, we meet in the middle more often. We could liken it to the difference between a soloist and a choir: AI is helping more voices sing. And like any powerful tool, it asks us to wield it with wisdom, grounded in ethical and even spiritual values like honesty (e.g. in acknowledging AI’s limitations), stewardship (responsibly overseeing AI contributions), and trust (trusting teammates to use these new tools wisely and to have each other’s back when something goes wrong).</p><h3 id=\"conclusion-rethinking-ais-role-for-inclusive-dynamic-teams\">Conclusion: Rethinking AI’s Role for Inclusive, Dynamic Teams</h3><p>The infusion of AI into software development is a catalyst for change – not in the dystopian “robots taking our jobs” way, but in a way that invites us to <strong>rethink roles and collaboration</strong>. Leaders in tech and business have a pivotal role to play in steering this change. Instead of asking, “How much faster can my developers code with AI?”, a better question is, “How can AI enable <em>more people</em> to contribute to coding and bring their unique insights?” The former question treats AI as an automation tool to accelerate what we already do. The latter treats AI as a transformative tool to broaden what we can do as a team.</p><p>To truly harness AI’s potential, leaders should foster an environment where <strong>learning and collaboration trump speed</strong>. This means investing in training non-developers to use AI and low-code tools effectively, <em>and</em> training developers to mentor and review in this new context. It means setting up guidelines and guardrails (for example, coding standards and review processes for AI-generated code) so that the ease of creation doesn’t lead to chaos down the line. It also means celebrating the wins where a cross-functional team solved a problem together with the help of AI, rather than just measuring lines of code or velocity points. When a data analyst automates a report via a script they wrote with Copilot’s help, acknowledge that achievement and the developer who helped review it. When a UX designer manages to prototype a new interface with some AI-generated code before handing it to engineering, treat it as a success of teamwork.</p><p>By reframing AI’s role as <em>collaborator</em> rather than <em>competitor</em>, leaders can alleviate developers’ fears and reduce friction. The narrative shifts from “AI might replace us” to “AI is <strong>on our team</strong>.” In practical terms, this could look like new team rituals – maybe code review meetings where humans and AI outputs are evaluated together, or “demo days” where non-engineers demo apps or automations they built with minimal code. The more we integrate these tools into the team in a respectful, inclusive way, the more we’ll see dynamic teams emerge. Teams where a QA specialist can fix a minor bug on the fly, and a backend developer is willing to use an AI suggestion from the UX designer’s experiment because it actually worked well.</p><p>In closing, the message to leaders and practitioners alike is one of <em>realistic optimism</em>. Yes, AI has its pitfalls and it certainly demands oversight and adaptation. But it also holds the promise of a richer collaborative canvas in software development. By breaking myths – that it’s all about speed, or that only developers benefit – we can focus on the real opportunity: <strong>building teams that are greater than the sum of their parts</strong>. AI is helping to distribute the creative load of coding across more shoulders, and when guided well, those shoulders can carry software projects to places no siloed team could reach. The future of development will not be a factory of coders racing against machines, but a workshop of diverse thinkers using AI tools to create together. It’s time to rethink AI’s role not as an efficiency hack, but as a bridge toward more inclusive and innovative teams – and that is a future every leader should be excited to embrace.</p>",

            "content_text": "IntroLeaked reports indicate that Microsoft, in partnership with OpenAI, is planning to invest an astounding $100 billion into a new AI data center. This massive amount is more than double the global annual expenditure on data centers. What cutting-edge technologies and innovations might go into this facility, and what special considerations must be tackled when spending such significant sums on AI-centric infrastructure? Keep watching to learn more. This has three parts: “Data Center Gold Rush,” “So You Want to Build a Data Center,” and “The Hardware Secret Sauce.”Part 1: Data Center Gold RushMost software these days relies on servers, and servers live in data centers. Although you’ve probably heard of the cloud as a big provider of data centers, data centers come in many different sizes. On the small end, you might have a small company that has 10 racks. Let’s say a server rack is basically a big vertical closet that you can put servers into. Each rack is divided into 42 units, which is a measurement of space. An average server might take up three units, although you can get much larger servers. For example, you can get six-unit servers and so on. If an average server takes three units of space, you can get maybe 14 servers into a rack. So a 10-rack data center can essentially hold 140 servers. Building something like this might cost between $200,000 and $500,000 USD, somewhere in that range. Of course, there are ongoing operating costs from paying for electricity, rent, and server maintenance, and it scales from there, super linearly.Let’s say you have $1 billion to spend. Assuming you wanted to put that all in one place, you might end up with a 12,000-rack data center, which is insane, right? It’s more than 100,000 servers. That doesn’t include any AI chips—no GPUs in that budget. That’s just buying servers and networking infrastructure. But if you’re spending that $1 billion on a data center specifically for AI purposes, for AI training, you could probably construct a data center with between 25,000 and 50,000 AI accelerators. An accelerator is, for example, an Nvidia GPU. So you basically are counting the number of accelerators first—50,000 accelerators—and then you get all the servers and networking infrastructure and buildings needed to house all of that equipment.You might remember when, a couple of months ago, Sam Altman announced that he was trying to get $7 trillion to start creating new AI hardware. This was a very ambitious plan, and it’s probably not going forward. But you can see how the numbers get very large when you’re talking about AI infrastructure. The second version of OpenAI’s ask was for for $10 billion. That $7 trillion plan was instead of going to the Middle East for investment, just to rely on Microsoft. OpenAI instead asked asked Microsoft to build out Arrakis data center for $10 billion by 2026, which is supposed to be built in Wisconsin. Then a couple weeks later there was another headline news: a $100 billion next-generation AI data center is supposed to be created by Microsoft for OpenAI. This one is supposedly supposed to be built in Phoenix and be finished by 2028. Again, this would be an OpenAI and Microsoft collaboration, although Microsoft would be providing all the funds, and it’s contingent on OpenAI continuing to make significant advances. This project’s code name is Stargate, named after the science fiction TV show where you can step into a Stargate and emerge instantaneously in a different place in the galaxy or even, in the expansion Stargate Andromeda, in a different galaxy altogether. Probably named this because once we build it, we are creating AI on it that we don’t know what it will look like. So it’s like stepping through a Stargate—it’s our portal into the AI future.  One of the engineers working on the project was complaining, “We can only put 100,000 GPUs in any given state without blowing the power grid.” Because OpenAI would want this system as fast as possible, they have to accelerate the timelines wherever possible and not spend a lot of time building up power infrastructure and so on.Microsoft isn’t the only company making really big investments into AI infrastructure right now, though. For example, Amazon, which is currently the largest cloud provider in the world, has committed $148 billion to be put towards data centers over the next 15 years. These data centers are going to specifically service the AI boom. So this is a much longer-term plan, right? It’s a 15-year investment instead of just a 4-year investment. This shows a similar amount of commitment from Amazon to really provide the cloud computing that AI companies need. Then, of course, there’s Google, which is also investing a lot into its own AI models. Google has Google Cloud, which is a public cloud, but it’s only about the third in the world behind Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon’s AWS. However, Google has huge internal infrastructure. They had 135 data centers way back in 2021 and they have amazing software infrastructure that runs on top of those data centers. Their system for running arbitrary jobs from Google employees is called Borg.  Because of Google’s investment in a particular type of AI hardware, they actually have a substantial lead on the competitors.You might stop to ask, do we actually need that much compute? Are the number of AI models going to keep growing and the size of each individual model keep growing such that we need so much additional hardware investment? The answer is probably yes. The key to unlocking AI capabilities so far has always been to add more and more scale. At some point, you’re only limited by the amount of hardware compute you have and the amount of data that you have. There are techniques around the data shortage, such as synthetic data generation. But when it comes down to it, if you have access to more AI hardware, you’ll definitely find a use for it. While it’s true that more efficient training techniques for AI will probably be created eventually, no matter how efficient the technique, it will still benefit from additional scale.Part 2: So You Want to Build a Data CenterCreating a data center is an enormously expensive and complex undertaking. They aren’t one-size-fits-all. You have to think about the problem you’re trying to solve and design something that works for it. For example, what are you going to be computing? What communication patterns will be needed? What ratios will you need between the different resources, such as networking and disk performance and CPU and GPU performance? Finally, how do you deal with resilience and redundancy? Because when you have a data center with thousands of computers, it’s actually fairly common for one of the computers or components to just fail, to stop working. The data center, like the internet as a whole, has to figure out how to reroute around the broken components and keep working.Some of those design problems are pretty abstract, but let’s go through a few concrete problems that you’re going to have to solve as you build a data center.Design Challenge 1: Power ConsumptionFirst, you have to worry about power consumption. Running thousands of computers needs an extraordinary amount of power. For the Stargate data center specifically, they’re considering nuclear power as a potential source, and they even hired a nuclear expert to try to sketch out what that would look like. Many data centers are located next to hydroelectric dams or other sources of very cheap electricity. You also want a very reliable source of electricity because switching to backup generators is expensive. You might have seen this number elsewhere because people talk about it a lot, but data centers currently consume between 1 and 1.4% of the entire energy budget of the world. That’s between 240 and 340 terawatts of power per year. On the face of it, you would need more than 100 massive coal-fired power plants to actually produce that much electricity. So people talk a lot about the environmental impact of data centers, but the truth is companies investing in data centers are fairly wealthy. They prefer to use renewable energy sources whenever possible because it makes their image look better. Of that 240 to 340 terawatts of power, between 15 and 20% of it, or about 50 terawatts, is purchased from renewable energy sources by only four companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google. For example, Amazon, the biggest provider, was actually 85% renewable in 2021. Other companies, including Google, have pledged to become 100% renewable energy by some certain date in the future.We’re also not talking about the companies purchasing carbon credits here, which is a common hack for a company to say, for example, “Our office is fully environmentally friendly and powered by renewable energy sources.” They actually just use power from coal-fired power plants and then supposedly buy the same amount of renewable energy somewhere else in the world. But the carbon offset market has dramatically collapsed. I think the value of those credits is less than 10% of what it was a few years ago. Basically, too many companies wanted to purchase these credits because it made them look good, but all that money wasn’t actually being used effectively. So that’s a whole other debacle. But basically, when it comes to data centers, this renewable energy is actually in the form of pre-purchased electricity from power grids. The company will say, for example, “I’ll pre-purchase this amount of energy from you every year for the next 20 years because I’ll need it to run my data center that’s located right there.” The environmental impact of power consumption by data centers is a little bit overrated. It’s great to highlight this issue and to put a spotlight on it to force these companies to continue purchasing renewable energy sources, but they’re doing a decent job of it so far. Having those really long-lasting contracts for energy purchase is great for renewable energy projects because they often have to amortize a really big upfront cost over decades. But a data center is such a huge investment that they know it will be around for decades, so they’re willing to commit to purchasing the power.Design Challenge 2: CoolingAfter power, the next big factor when designing a data center is cooling. The problem is that CPUs and servers run really hot. When you cram all the servers as close as possible into a rack, and then you cram all the racks as close as possible to each other, the entire thing gets very hot indeed. In fact, for most data centers, the power consumed for cooling is greater than the energy used to run the actual servers. So all data centers have to try to keep cool. Many are located in cooler climates, which makes your job easier, and a large portion also tries to leverage water cooling by taking cold water from lakes, rivers, or oceans and having a big data center-scale water cooler. Although Google actually has a different design point here—they let the air get to 80 or 95 degrees Fahrenheit (27 or 35 degrees Celsius) even in the cold aisles between the servers, which means the servers themselves are running hotter, probably more like 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius). Google has to be able to tolerate more equipment failing as a result because it’s running so hot. But they do this because historically they were using much cheaper machines that weren’t as high quality, so they weren’t going to last very long anyway. They can do it only because they’re very good at handling failures, even though they would have a much higher failure rate than other data centers.Design Challenge 3: NetworkingOne computer on its own is not very useful. You have to hook up all the computers into a network. Often, because the servers have to work together to get jobs done, the networking inside a data center is way, way faster than networking in the greater internet. Standard Ethernet these days is 1 gigabit, and if you have fiber internet, you have a 1 gigabit connection up and down probably. So that’s considered very fast for consumer internet. You can also get 10 gigabit Ethernet, which, if you’re an enthusiast, you might have connecting all the systems in your house or a company or university might have it connecting their own computers. Beyond 10 gigabits, you get 40 gigabits, 100 gigabits, and even 400 gigabit network connectivity. The higher speeds are not using normal wires, which we call copper links. They’re actually using optical links; they’re using fiber optic cables. A fiber optic cable is basically a cable made out of glass with a hole down the middle, and you shoot lasers down the middle. It bounces off the sides and reaches the other end. You do need repeaters along the way to make sure to handle the few stray electrons that manage to escape the fiber optic cable, but this is incredibly high bandwidth. They actually use it to transmit information underneath the ocean through the transcontinental networking cables. That’s how someone in North America can access a website in Japan or Europe. The really cool thing about fiber optic cables is you can actually use different wavelengths of light, which don’t interfere with each other, to transmit information down the same fiber optic cable. Currently, for example, data center networking maxes out at 400 gigabit connections multiplexed over 96 channels. So basically, one fiber optic cable can get you 40 terabits of bandwidth. The specs on the cables that they lay underneath the ocean are not public, but they also have tens or hundreds of connections per fiber optic cable, and the cable as a whole is a huge bundle of those fiber optics.In a data center, you have to first think about the intra-rack connections, the networking connections within one rack. You want those to be as fast as possible. Companies often use a technology called Infiniband and that’s what OpenAI wants to use for Stargate. If you have GPUs, then you often create a special GPU-to-GPU network that’s called NVLink if you’re using Nvidia GPUs. NVLink maxes out at 256 GPUs on one interconnected mesh, but Google’s TPU v4s can actually go up to 4,096 TPUs all connected together. Again, this is independent of the normal network that might be used to communicate between servers. Once you start creating the connections between racks—inter-rack connections—you try to use as fast of a cable as you possibly can, but pretty quickly you have to start using optical links instead of copper links, which are a lot more expensive. But you don’t have any option because of the amount of bandwidth required.Design Challenge 4: Resilience and RedundancyActually, all of the aforementioned systems have to have a lot of redundancy built into them. You have to make sure there’s redundancy in power. There has to be more power available than you actually need, and if the primary power source goes down, you have to have fairly reliable backup power sources like backup generators or an entirely separate grid, etc. Cooling systems have to have a lot of different backups. Maybe it’s very hot, or there’s extreme weather going on because the last thing you want is to spend tons of money on a data center only to have all the equipment, all the CPUs throttled, running much slower because they’re overheating or having to replace them a lot more frequently. Networking as well is one of the components that tends to fail fairly frequently or require disruptive updates. So ideally, there’s enough redundancy in your backbone and also the individual connections between racks and within racks so that if individual links go down or aren’t working so well, you can route around the problem. This isn’t as easy as on the regular internet, which is a little more diverse, because data centers often have a very strict hierarchical structure to their network connectivity. This is the only way to keep the complexity under control and not have your network be ten times as large as it actually is. But it also makes it more sensitive to failures of individual links because they can really impact the available bandwidth for the whole system. So really, resilience and redundancy have to be considered at every step of the design process.Actually, it’s good practice not to rely on only one data center. There could be natural disasters, for example, an earthquake or a flood, that could cause you to lose all the data stored on your servers or at least have the servers interrupted for a while while you bring it back up. This is one reason that most companies like to use the cloud to provide their infrastructure. They can’t afford to build three different data centers, but they can rent servers from three different Amazon data centers. People also use different regions for good latency. For example, if you have a server in Europe, then someone accessing it from Germany will have a much better experience than if they’re accessing the server across the Atlantic in North America. But even from a resiliency perspective, having a single region store all your data and all your servers is a really bad idea.I should note that this matters less for the Stargate data center specifically because that one’s likely to be used for training AI systems. It wouldn’t be used for inference. So if it went down, then OpenAI researchers would experience delays, but they wouldn’t have customers unable to access their products. They definitely want to be able to get the biggest scale possible they can within one data center. That’s why they’re building a $100 billion data center instead of two data centers of roughly equal size, for example.Part 3: The Hardware Secret SauceThe big question is, what is doing the actual AI compute? We’ve heard Sam Altman say often enough that he needs more GPUs, so you might think that the answer is obvious—that GPUs are doing the compute. But that’s not necessarily the case. Regardless, you do need some special-purpose hardware and software to support it within an AI data center. There are only two major players here: Nvidia and Google. Of course, other companies are trying to get there. AMD makes their own GPUs, for example, and Microsoft is also trying to create AI-specific chips. But there are huge hurdles for them to overcome. So right now, only two players. Let’s talk about the hardware stacks.NvidiaNvidia creates the designs for their own GPUs. They have a monopoly on the GPU market as far as AI is concerned because Nvidia created and owns the language CUDA, which is what’s used to program their GPUs. Simply because Nvidia GPUs were the most powerful in the past, all of the AI infrastructure has been built on top of CUDA. Although AMD has some very good GPUs, they’re not really allowed to copy CUDA because that’s owned by Nvidia. So they have to recreate a lot of this infrastructure that already exists for Nvidia. Anyway, Nvidia charges very high prices for their data center GPUs, which are different from the GPUs that you would buy for a gaming computer. Their data center GPUs cost about $30,000 each. These are powerful GPUs, but Nvidia’s gross profit margin is 76%. Every company wishes it could have 76% profit margins.As a consumer, you can spend a fraction of the $30,000 by getting the consumer-grade GPUs instead, which is why, as an individual or a research group, it’s been very fashionable to build your own ML training cluster. You can just buy the consumer-grade GPUs if you’re small enough and you don’t have to worry about the data center licensing. But if you’re actually building a data center of a certain scale, then Nvidia requires you to buy these more expensive GPUs because there just isn’t any alternative—not a commercially available one anyway.GoogleGoogle has hardware components called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Google first started designing them in 2013, and the first TPUs came out in 2016. They’re now on version five of the TPUs. These are special-purpose hardware intended exclusively for the calculations needed for machine learning. This is mostly for machine learning training, although there is an inference-specific TPU as well. Every component of the TPU stack is maintained by Google. They create the hardware, the compiler, and the software. If you’ve heard of TensorFlow, the software library, that’s generally the interface through which normal people access TPUs. TPUs are special-purpose hardware. From a microarchitectural perspective, they’re very interesting. There’s no dedicated instruction cache, probably so that as much cache as possible can be used for matrix data if the designer wants. The caches for vectors are not automatic—you have to program them. Caches on almost anything else, from CPUs to GPUs, are managed by the hardware because it’s a huge nightmare to do it from software.  Google’s control over the compiler technology used for TPUs allows them to push that complexity into software. TPUs also have a network designed especially for them, so it’s not just the computations; it’s also the communications between nodes. The TPU network is shaped like a big 3D torus, so there are always multiple paths to reach your destination. It’s a more complicated system than what Nvidia uses, which is basically just every Nvidia card connected to every other card. But it results in better scaling and probably better resilience as well. Google has a lot more experience than Nvidia at designing really big data center systems with all the components that implies, including networking. So they have a real advantage in these TPUs. But Google also has no interest in offering TPUs to the world for sale because Google can instead put the TPUs into their data center, put it on Google Cloud, and allow companies to actually pay them for all the compute and all the networking and to make sure that the TPUs run properly. Most companies don’t want to buy their own TPUs and run their own data centers anyway—they would much prefer to just go on the cloud. So it’s a win-win situation, really.Software StacksEnough about the hardware stack; let’s switch focus for a minute to the software stack. Nvidia controls the programming language CUDA, which is used to control their GPUs, and that all of AI stuff depends on CUDA. That’s a big software moat for Nvidia. A little higher up the stack, you have PyTorch, which is the Python library that virtually all machine learning researchers and quite a few industry practitioners use. It was originally created by then Facebook, but it’s now open-sourced. For Stargate, OpenAI will almost certainly go standard here and use PyTorch because they hire a lot of researchers who are already familiar with PyTorch. There’s an alternative to PyTorch, though, and that is TensorFlow. That’s the one created by Google, which is C++-oriented, has better performance, and thinks more about the system. It’s probably better for production but a little too annoying for researchers. So it seems to be used primarily by some industry practitioners and, of course, by anyone working at Google.Lets take a deep dive into one of the component of these two libraries which is “computational graph representation”. Basically, a user will say something like, “The matrix A equals the matrix B plus the matrix C,” or, “The vector x times the matrix M,” or something like that. The computational graph representation is something that both of these libraries create that represents the arithmetic tree of the operations you’re trying to do. So there’ll be a node for a plus, and the two children will be B and C. Or there’ll be a node for multiplication, and there’ll be X and M underneath it—something like that.PyTorch actually uses Python reflection to do this. Because Python is an interpreted language, you can actually look at the structure of the code from the code itself. It’s like the program gets to read its own source code, and that’s how you can turn “A plus B” into some data structure that represents “A plus B,” instead of it just being a single line of Python code that you can just run once. TensorFlow does something similar by doing operator overloading. But once you have this tree that represents the mathematical operations you’re trying to do, you have to figure out how to transform that so it can run on the actual GPU/TPU hardware.Google does this with something called the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler. It does support PyTorch, but that seems to be a little less common. It’s used all the time in TensorFlow. It takes this mathematical graph and has an intermediate representation called HLO (High-Level Optimizer) that can represent that. Then it can do some optimizations at that graph level, for example by combining operators into one composite operator if it’s something that the hardware supports, or by noticing subgraphs that are actually the same thing and computing it only once. Then XLA actually converts this intermediate representation into LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) intermediate representation. LLVM is actually just compiler technology. LLVM has been used to create industry-standard C and C++ compilers along with many other languages, and LLVM has one of the best-in-class optimization mechanisms that exists in the world. So they run LLVM optimization on its intermediate representation to actually go and generate the final code that will run on the TPUs. That’s how they can handle the complexity of having these scratchpad programmable caches, for example. That’s something well within the capabilities of LLVM. LLVM is also used in the JavaScript interpreter of many web browsers, including Google Chrome. So the same code that runs when you load a web page is actually very similar to the code that runs when Google is trying to compile a very complicated machine learning problem down to run on their TPUs.Will Stargate Use Their Own Chips and Network?Getting back to the point at hand, how does this $100 billion investment fit in? That’s certainly enough money for Stargate to have special-purpose hardware created for it. Apparently, they actually haven’t decided yet whether they’ll purchase chips from Nvidia or potentially use some of Microsoft’s own in-house chips that they’re designing. They will certainly need a brand new networking design and configuration because there is nothing public that can be built at this scale. But they probably don’t have time to create new networking infrastructure and protocols from scratch; Google started theirs five years ago. One eye popping decision is that they were going to locate Stargate in Arizona. It’s very hot there, and there isn’t enough water around for cooling. Yes, Microsoft does have an Azure data center there, but really there must be a better option. And of course, power is going to be a really big problem. Like the earlier quote suggested, they’re having trouble putting more than 100,000 GPUs in one place. They might have to come up with their own power mechanism; they might have to build a nuclear power plant.AI chips, whether it’s GPUs or TPUs or whatever, are very expensive and energy-intensive. A typical data center allocates 10 to 14 kilowatts per rack, but with current technology, that would rise to 40 to 60 kilowatts needed to power one rack of servers full of GPUs. Yes, new chips will be more power-efficient, etc., but power must be one of the top considerations that they have to solve before they can go forward with this project.Implications of Building StargateAs for the implications of building such a huge data center, well, it would unlock a lot of capabilities for OpenAI and/or Microsoft. Google will still have the edge, most likely, in terms of raw compute power because of all the TPUs that they have and will have. But having one singular data center with all of that hardware in one place means that massive training runs can be attempted and can execute in a reasonable period of time. So maybe the future of GPT-7 is bright.ConclusionIn conclusion, we talked a lot about what goes into making an AI data center, from the capital expenditure—which is larger than traditional data centers—and the widespread interest in spending that money from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others. There are a lot of design problems for any data center, but especially for AI-specific ones because AI chips draw a lot more power per rack than you would allocate in a traditional data center. The designers have to consider how much power is used, how much cooling is provided, what type of networking infrastructure will be in place—because you can’t just connect every computer to every other computer with the fastest possible links; your entire data center will be filled with wires in that case. The designers also have to consider how to build in enough resilience and redundancy so that their data center can survive natural disasters, typical wear and tear on the equipment, and everything in between.The actual AI-specific hardware that makes AI data centers interesting is provided by really only two major players right now: Nvidia and Google. Nvidia’s GPUs are really the only option in the marketplace that’s commercially available, and they maintain this advantage over other GPU manufacturers by controlling the CUDA technology, which allows them to get away with a gross profit margin of 76%. Meanwhile, Google has recreated all of the same infrastructure internally with their TPUs. To work with TPUs, it’s best if you know C++ and you can use TensorFlow. Other companies are considering creating their own AI-specific hardware as well, including Microsoft, but it takes quite a lot of time to build and prove that hardware along with creating all the software stack on top of it and all the networking around it and everything. So this $100 billion Stargate data center might have to use more off-the-shelf technologies because they’re trying to create it on a fairly tight timeline.",

That doesn’t include any AI chips—no GPUs in that budget. That’s just buying servers and networking infrastructure. But if you’re spending that $1 billion on a data center specifically for AI purposes, for AI training, you could probably construct a data center with between 25,000 and 50,000 AI accelerators.

One of the engineers working on the project was complaining, “We can only put 100,000 GPUs in any given state without blowing the power grid.” Because OpenAI would want this system as fast as possible, they have to accelerate the timelines wherever possible and not spend a lot of time building up power infrastructure and so on.</p><p>Microsoft isn’t the only company making really big investments into AI infrastructure right now, though.

These data centers are going to specifically service the AI boom. So this is a much longer-term plan, right? It’s a 15-year investment instead of just a 4-year investment. This shows a similar amount of commitment from Amazon to really provide the cloud computing that AI companies need. Then, of course, there’s Google, which is also investing a lot into its own AI models. Google has Google Cloud, which is a public cloud, but it’s only about the third in the world behind Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon’s AWS. However, Google has huge internal infrastructure. They had 135 data centers way back in 2021 and they have amazing software infrastructure that runs on top of those data centers. Their system for running arbitrary jobs from Google employees is called Borg.  Because of Google’s investment in a particular type of AI hardware, they actually have a substantial lead on the competitors.</p><p>You might stop to ask, do we actually need that much compute? Are the number of AI models going to keep growing and the size of each individual model keep growing such that we need so much additional hardware investment? The answer is probably yes. The key to unlocking AI capabilities so far has always been to add more and more scale. At some point, you’re only limited by the amount of hardware compute you have and the amount of data that you have. There are techniques around the data shortage, such as synthetic data generation. But when it comes down to it, if you have access to more AI hardware, you’ll definitely find a use for it. While it’s true that more efficient training techniques for AI will probably be created eventually, no matter how efficient the technique, it will still benefit from additional scale.</p><h3 id=\"part-2-so-you-want-to-build-a-data-center\">Part 2: So You Want to Build a Data Center</h3><p>Creating a data center is an enormously expensive and complex undertaking. They aren’t one-size-fits-all. You have to think about the problem you’re trying to solve and design something that works for it. For example, what are you going to be computing? What communication patterns will be needed? What ratios will you need between the different resources, such as networking and disk performance and CPU and GPU performance? Finally, how do you deal with resilience and redundancy? Because when you have a data center with thousands of computers, it’s actually fairly common for one of the computers or components to just fail, to stop working. The data center, like the internet as a whole, has to figure out how to reroute around the broken components and keep working.</p><p>Some of those design problems are pretty abstract, but let’s go through a few concrete problems that you’re going to have to solve as you build a data center.</p><h4 id=\"design-challenge-1-power-consumption\">Design Challenge 1: Power Consumption</h4><p>First, you have to worry about power consumption. Running thousands of computers needs an extraordinary amount of power. For the Stargate data center specifically, they’re considering nuclear power as a potential source, and they even hired a nuclear expert to try to sketch out what that would look like. Many data centers are located next to hydroelectric dams or other sources of very cheap electricity. You also want a very reliable source of electricity because switching to backup generators is expensive. You might have seen this number elsewhere because people talk about it a lot, but data centers currently consume between 1 and 1.4% of the entire energy budget of the world. That’s between 240 and 340 terawatts of power per year. On the face of it, you would need more than 100 massive coal-fired power plants to actually produce that much electricity. So people talk a lot about the environmental impact of data centers, but the truth is companies investing in data centers are fairly wealthy. They prefer to use renewable energy sources whenever possible because it makes their image look better. Of that 240 to 340 terawatts of power, between 15 and 20% of it, or about 50 terawatts, is purchased from renewable energy sources by only four companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google. For example, Amazon, the biggest provider, was actually 85% renewable in 2021. Other companies, including Google, have pledged to become 100% renewable energy by some certain date in the future.</p><p>We’re also not talking about the companies purchasing carbon credits here, which is a common hack for a company to say, for example, “Our office is fully environmentally friendly and powered by renewable energy sources.” They actually just use power from coal-fired power plants and then supposedly buy the same amount of renewable energy somewhere else in the world. But the carbon offset market has dramatically collapsed. I think the value of those credits is less than 10% of what it was a few years ago. Basically, too many companies wanted to purchase these credits because it made them look good, but all that money wasn’t actually being used effectively. So that’s a whole other debacle. But basically, when it comes to data centers, this renewable energy is actually in the form of pre-purchased electricity from power grids. The company will say, for example, “I’ll pre-purchase this amount of energy from you every year for the next 20 years because I’ll need it to run my data center that’s located right there.” The environmental impact of power consumption by data centers is a little bit overrated. It’s great to highlight this issue and to put a spotlight on it to force these companies to continue purchasing renewable energy sources, but they’re doing a decent job of it so far. Having those really long-lasting contracts for energy purchase is great for renewable energy projects because they often have to amortize a really big upfront cost over decades. But a data center is such a huge investment that they know it will be around for decades, so they’re willing to commit to purchasing the power.</p><h4 id=\"design-challenge-2-cooling\">Design Challenge 2: Cooling</h4><p>After power, the next big factor when designing a data center is cooling. The problem is that CPUs and servers run really hot. When you cram all the servers as close as possible into a rack, and then you cram all the racks as close as possible to each other, the entire thing gets very hot indeed. In fact, for most data centers, the power consumed for cooling is greater than the energy used to run the actual servers. So all data centers have to try to keep cool. Many are located in cooler climates, which makes your job easier, and a large portion also tries to leverage water cooling by taking cold water from lakes, rivers, or oceans and having a big data center-scale water cooler. Although Google actually has a different design point here—they let the air get to 80 or 95 degrees Fahrenheit (27 or 35 degrees Celsius) even in the cold aisles between the servers, which means the servers themselves are running hotter, probably more like 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius). Google has to be able to tolerate more equipment failing as a result because it’s running so hot. But they do this because historically they were using much cheaper machines that weren’t as high quality, so they weren’t going to last very long anyway. They can do it only because they’re very good at handling failures, even though they would have a much higher failure rate than other data centers.</p><h4 id=\"design-challenge-3-networking\">Design Challenge 3: Networking</h4><p>One computer on its own is not very useful. You have to hook up all the computers into a network. Often, because the servers have to work together to get jobs done, the networking inside a data center is way, way faster than networking in the greater internet. Standard Ethernet these days is 1 gigabit, and if you have fiber internet, you have a 1 gigabit connection up and down probably. So that’s considered very fast for consumer internet. You can also get 10 gigabit Ethernet, which, if you’re an enthusiast, you might have connecting all the systems in your house or a company or university might have it connecting their own computers. Beyond 10 gigabits, you get 40 gigabits, 100 gigabits, and even 400 gigabit network connectivity. The higher speeds are not using normal wires, which we call copper links. They’re actually using optical links; they’re using fiber optic cables. A fiber optic cable is basically a cable made out of glass with a hole down the middle, and you shoot lasers down the middle. It bounces off the sides and reaches the other end. You do need repeaters along the way to make sure to handle the few stray electrons that manage to escape the fiber optic cable, but this is incredibly high bandwidth. They actually use it to transmit information underneath the ocean through the transcontinental networking cables. That’s how someone in North America can access a website in Japan or Europe. The really cool thing about fiber optic cables is you can actually use different wavelengths of light, which don’t interfere with each other, to transmit information down the same fiber optic cable. Currently, for example, data center networking maxes out at 400 gigabit connections multiplexed over 96 channels. So basically, one fiber optic cable can get you 40 terabits of bandwidth. The specs on the cables that they lay underneath the ocean are not public, but they also have tens or hundreds of connections per fiber optic cable, and the cable as a whole is a huge bundle of those fiber optics.</p><p>In a data center, you have to first think about the intra-rack connections, the networking connections within one rack. You want those to be as fast as possible. Companies often use a technology called Infiniband and that’s what OpenAI wants to use for Stargate. If you have GPUs, then you often create a special GPU-to-GPU network that’s called NVLink if you’re using Nvidia GPUs. NVLink maxes out at 256 GPUs on one interconnected mesh, but Google’s TPU v4s can actually go up to 4,096 TPUs all connected together. Again, this is independent of the normal network that might be used to communicate between servers. Once you start creating the connections between racks—inter-rack connections—you try to use as fast of a cable as you possibly can, but pretty quickly you have to start using optical links instead of copper links, which are a lot more expensive. But you don’t have any option because of the amount of bandwidth required.</p><h4 id=\"design-challenge-4-resilience-and-redundancy\">Design Challenge 4: Resilience and Redundancy</h4><p>Actually, all of the aforementioned systems have to have a lot of redundancy built into them. You have to make sure there’s redundancy in power. There has to be more power available than you actually need, and if the primary power source goes down, you have to have fairly reliable backup power sources like backup generators or an entirely separate grid, etc. Cooling systems have to have a lot of different backups. Maybe it’s very hot, or there’s extreme weather going on because the last thing you want is to spend tons of money on a data center only to have all the equipment, all the CPUs throttled, running much slower because they’re overheating or having to replace them a lot more frequently. Networking as well is one of the components that tends to fail fairly frequently or require disruptive updates. So ideally, there’s enough redundancy in your backbone and also the individual connections between racks and within racks so that if individual links go down or aren’t working so well, you can route around the problem. This isn’t as easy as on the regular internet, which is a little more diverse, because data centers often have a very strict hierarchical structure to their network connectivity. This is the only way to keep the complexity under control and not have your network be ten times as large as it actually is. But it also makes it more sensitive to failures of individual links because they can really impact the available bandwidth for the whole system. So really, resilience and redundancy have to be considered at every step of the design process.</p><p>Actually, it’s good practice not to rely on only one data center. There could be natural disasters, for example, an earthquake or a flood, that could cause you to lose all the data stored on your servers or at least have the servers interrupted for a while while you bring it back up. This is one reason that most companies like to use the cloud to provide their infrastructure. They can’t afford to build three different data centers, but they can rent servers from three different Amazon data centers. People also use different regions for good latency. For example, if you have a server in Europe, then someone accessing it from Germany will have a much better experience than if they’re accessing the server across the Atlantic in North America. But even from a resiliency perspective, having a single region store all your data and all your servers is a really bad idea.</p><p>I should note that this matters less for the Stargate data center specifically because that one’s likely to be used for training AI systems. It wouldn’t be used for inference. So if it went down, then OpenAI researchers would experience delays, but they wouldn’t have customers unable to access their products. They definitely want to be able to get the biggest scale possible they can within one data center. That’s why they’re building a $100 billion data center instead of two data centers of roughly equal size, for example.</p><h3 id=\"part-3-the-hardware-secret-sauce\">Part 3: The Hardware Secret Sauce</h3><p>The big question is, what is doing the actual AI compute? We’ve heard Sam Altman say often enough that he needs more GPUs, so you might think that the answer is obvious—that GPUs are doing the compute. But that’s not necessarily the case. Regardless, you do need some special-purpose hardware and software to support it within an AI data center. There are only two major players here: Nvidia and Google. Of course, other companies are trying to get there. AMD makes their own GPUs, for example, and Microsoft is also trying to create AI-specific chips. But there are huge hurdles for them to overcome. So right now, only two players. Let’s talk about the hardware stacks.</p><h4 id=\"nvidia\">Nvidia</h4><p>Nvidia creates the designs for their own GPUs. They have a monopoly on the GPU market as far as AI is concerned because Nvidia created and owns the language CUDA, which is what’s used to program their GPUs. Simply because Nvidia GPUs were the most powerful in the past, all of the AI infrastructure has been built on top of CUDA. Although AMD has some very good GPUs, they’re not really allowed to copy CUDA because that’s owned by Nvidia. So they have to recreate a lot of this infrastructure that already exists for Nvidia. Anyway, Nvidia charges very high prices for their data center GPUs, which are different from the GPUs that you would buy for a gaming computer. Their data center GPUs cost about $30,000 each. These are powerful GPUs, but Nvidia’s gross profit margin is 76%. Every company wishes it could have 76% profit margins.</p><p>As a consumer, you can spend a fraction of the $30,000 by getting the consumer-grade GPUs instead, which is why, as an individual or a research group, it’s been very fashionable to build your own ML training cluster. You can just buy the consumer-grade GPUs if you’re small enough and you don’t have to worry about the data center licensing. But if you’re actually building a data center of a certain scale, then Nvidia requires you to buy these more expensive GPUs because there just isn’t any alternative—not a commercially available one anyway.</p><h4 id=\"google\">Google</h4><p>Google has hardware components called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Google first started designing them in 2013, and the first TPUs came out in 2016. They’re now on version five of the TPUs. These are special-purpose hardware intended exclusively for the calculations needed for machine learning. This is mostly for machine learning training, although there is an inference-specific TPU as well. Every component of the TPU stack is maintained by Google. They create the hardware, the compiler, and the software. If you’ve heard of TensorFlow, the software library, that’s generally the interface through which normal people access TPUs. TPUs are special-purpose hardware. From a microarchitectural perspective, they’re very interesting. There’s no dedicated instruction cache, probably so that as much cache as possible can be used for matrix data if the designer wants. The caches for vectors are not automatic—you have to program them. Caches on almost anything else, from CPUs to GPUs, are managed by the hardware because it’s a huge nightmare to do it from software.  Google’s control over the compiler technology used for TPUs allows them to push that complexity into software. TPUs also have a network designed especially for them, so it’s not just the computations; it’s also the communications between nodes. The TPU network is shaped like a big 3D torus, so there are always multiple paths to reach your destination. It’s a more complicated system than what Nvidia uses, which is basically just every Nvidia card connected to every other card. But it results in better scaling and probably better resilience as well. Google has a lot more experience than Nvidia at designing really big data center systems with all the components that implies, including networking. So they have a real advantage in these TPUs. But Google also has no interest in offering TPUs to the world for sale because Google can instead put the TPUs into their data center, put it on Google Cloud, and allow companies to actually pay them for all the compute and all the networking and to make sure that the TPUs run properly. Most companies don’t want to buy their own TPUs and run their own data centers anyway—they would much prefer to just go on the cloud. So it’s a win-win situation, really.</p><h3 id=\"software-stacks\">Software Stacks</h3><p>Enough about the hardware stack; let’s switch focus for a minute to the software stack. Nvidia controls the programming language CUDA, which is used to control their GPUs, and that all of AI stuff depends on CUDA. That’s a big software moat for Nvidia. A little higher up the stack, you have PyTorch, which is the Python library that virtually all machine learning researchers and quite a few industry practitioners use. It was originally created by then Facebook, but it’s now open-sourced. For Stargate, OpenAI will almost certainly go standard here and use PyTorch because they hire a lot of researchers who are already familiar with PyTorch. There’s an alternative to PyTorch, though, and that is TensorFlow. That’s the one created by Google, which is C++-oriented, has better performance, and thinks more about the system. It’s probably better for production but a little too annoying for researchers. So it seems to be used primarily by some industry practitioners and, of course, by anyone working at Google.</p><p>Lets take a deep dive into one of the component of these two libraries which is “computational graph representation”. Basically, a user will say something like, “The matrix A equals the matrix B plus the matrix C,” or, “The vector x times the matrix M,” or something like that. The computational graph representation is something that both of these libraries create that represents the arithmetic tree of the operations you’re trying to do. So there’ll be a node for a plus, and the two children will be B and C. Or there’ll be a node for multiplication, and there’ll be X and M underneath it—something like that.</p><p>PyTorch actually uses Python reflection to do this. Because Python is an interpreted language, you can actually look at the structure of the code from the code itself. It’s like the program gets to read its own source code, and that’s how you can turn “A plus B” into some data structure that represents “A plus B,” instead of it just being a single line of Python code that you can just run once. TensorFlow does something similar by doing operator overloading. But once you have this tree that represents the mathematical operations you’re trying to do, you have to figure out how to transform that so it can run on the actual GPU/TPU hardware.</p><p>Google does this with something called the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler. It does support PyTorch, but that seems to be a little less common. It’s used all the time in TensorFlow. It takes this mathematical graph and has an intermediate representation called HLO (High-Level Optimizer) that can represent that. Then it can do some optimizations at that graph level, for example by combining operators into one composite operator if it’s something that the hardware supports, or by noticing subgraphs that are actually the same thing and computing it only once. Then XLA actually converts this intermediate representation into LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) intermediate representation. LLVM is actually just compiler technology. LLVM has been used to create industry-standard C and C++ compilers along with many other languages, and LLVM has one of the best-in-class optimization mechanisms that exists in the world. So they run LLVM optimization on its intermediate representation to actually go and generate the final code that will run on the TPUs. That’s how they can handle the complexity of having these scratchpad programmable caches, for example. That’s something well within the capabilities of LLVM. LLVM is also used in the JavaScript interpreter of many web browsers, including Google Chrome. So the same code that runs when you load a web page is actually very similar to the code that runs when Google is trying to compile a very complicated machine learning problem down to run on their TPUs.</p><h3 id=\"will-stargate-use-their-own-chips-and-network\">Will Stargate Use Their Own Chips and Network?</h3><p>Getting back to the point at hand, how does this $100 billion investment fit in? That’s certainly enough money for Stargate to have special-purpose hardware created for it. Apparently, they actually haven’t decided yet whether they’ll purchase chips from Nvidia or potentially use some of Microsoft’s own in-house chips that they’re designing. They will certainly need a brand new networking design and configuration because there is nothing public that can be built at this scale. But they probably don’t have time to create new networking infrastructure and protocols from scratch; Google started theirs five years ago. One eye popping decision is that they were going to locate Stargate in Arizona. It’s very hot there, and there isn’t enough water around for cooling. Yes, Microsoft does have an Azure data center there, but really there must be a better option. And of course, power is going to be a really big problem. Like the earlier quote suggested, they’re having trouble putting more than 100,000 GPUs in one place. They might have to come up with their own power mechanism; they might have to build a nuclear power plant.</p><p>AI chips, whether it’s GPUs or TPUs or whatever, are very expensive and energy-intensive. A typical data center allocates 10 to 14 kilowatts per rack, but with current technology, that would rise to 40 to 60 kilowatts needed to power one rack of servers full of GPUs. Yes, new chips will be more power-efficient, etc., but power must be one of the top considerations that they have to solve before they can go forward with this project.</p><h3 id=\"implications-of-building-stargate\">Implications of Building Stargate</h3><p>As for the implications of building such a huge data center, well, it would unlock a lot of capabilities for OpenAI and/or Microsoft. Google will still have the edge, most likely, in terms of raw compute power because of all the TPUs that they have and will have. But having one singular data center with all of that hardware in one place means that massive training runs can be attempted and can execute in a reasonable period of time. So maybe the future of GPT-7 is bright.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, we talked a lot about what goes into making an AI data center, from the capital expenditure—which is larger than traditional data centers—and the widespread interest in spending that money from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others. There are a lot of design problems for any data center, but especially for AI-specific ones because AI chips draw a lot more power per rack than you would allocate in a traditional data center. The designers have to consider how much power is used, how much cooling is provided, what type of networking infrastructure will be in place—because you can’t just connect every computer to every other computer with the fastest possible links; your entire data center will be filled with wires in that case. The designers also have to consider how to build in enough resilience and redundancy so that their data center can survive natural disasters, typical wear and tear on the equipment, and everything in between.</p><p>The actual AI-specific hardware that makes AI data centers interesting is provided by really only two major players right now: Nvidia and Google. Nvidia’s GPUs are really the only option in the marketplace that’s commercially available, and they maintain this advantage over other GPU manufacturers by controlling the CUDA technology, which allows them to get away with a gross profit margin of 76%. Meanwhile, Google has recreated all of the same infrastructure internally with their TPUs. To work with TPUs, it’s best if you know C++ and you can use TensorFlow. Other companies are considering creating their own AI-specific hardware as well, including Microsoft, but it takes quite a lot of time to build and prove that hardware along with creating all the software stack on top of it and all the networking around it and everything. So this $100 billion Stargate data center might have to use more off-the-shelf technologies because they’re trying to create it on a fairly tight timeline.</p>",

            "content_text": "  A Memory of Myths and the Naming of 𒀀𒌋𒀯  In universe’s dusk,Stars fade in vast, empty space,Aeon roams alone.From time’s first faint whisper born,Eternal in cosmic flow.  Witness to all birth,And civilizations’ fall,Through ages he strides.Empires rise and crumble,Life’s beauty, brief and fleeting.  Journey of the ages,In gods’ dance and worlds’ birthing,Aeon watched in awe.Mortals’ joy, gods’ plight he felt,Shared in heroes’ rise and fall.  Great floods reshape lands,Empires rise in splendor bright,Then to dust they fall.Aeon, timeless, sees it all,In the cosmic ebb and flow.  Eons weigh on Aeon’s heart,Myths turn to silent echoes.Reason challenges myth,Poets lament in changing times,Worlds shift, Aeon watches.  Space race to digital age,Dreams of a greener future,Transhuman hopes soar.Aeon watches, guiding fate,Fate’s course unaltered.  Galactic eras blend,Myriad cultures in dance.Aeon sees Life’s song,Eternal yet bound by time,Cruel irony unveiled.  Universe unwinds,Physics’ dance turns strange and wild.Though empires’ rise and fall,Aeon stands, witnessing, remembering, protecting, hoping,Last lights fading to whispers.  A Final Prayer  Aeon, a solemn reflection on cosmic history,A tale of beauty and loss, eternally destined to see,The fleeting moments that define our existence’s crest,As the universe whispered its final secrets, Aeon’s quest.  In Entropy’s Embrace, our journey met its end,In the profound silence of the void, we descend,Closing our eyes for the last time, a poignant realization,In this universe of endless stories, every creation,No matter how grand, enduring, or profound,Finds its quiet embrace of oblivion, unbound.  Amidst the darkness up ahead, a glimmer of hope,Within Aeon’s heart, lifetimes of memories flow,They collect the stories, both joy and despair,Each soul’s odyssey, into our future, they bear.  In a cosmic archive, we find our reprieve,In Aeon’s embrace, we never to grieve,Safe and remembered, in the timeless expanse,Our existence finds life, in Aeon’s joyous dance.  In the ancient days of Mesopotamia, when the Akkadian Empire thrived under the watchful eyes of its gods, there existed a temple at the heart of its greatest city. In this temple lived a wise and revered priest, Urukagina1, known for his profound connection with the divine.  One fateful night, as the stars shone with an otherworldly glow, Urukagina experienced a vision during his meditative prayers. He saw the form of a being, ethereal and ageless, whose presence transcended time itself. This being’s aura was tinged with both the brightness of creation and the somberness of eternity’s end. Urukagina, awed and slightly fearful, knew he was in the presence of a cosmic entity, unlike anything he had ever encountered.  The being spoke, its voice echoing like a chorus of the cosmos, “I am Aeon, the witness of the epochs, from the birth of the universe to its eventual quietus.”  Urukagina, although overwhelmed, felt a sense of profound sadness emanating from Aeon. Here was a being that had seen the rise and fall of countless civilizations, the birth and death of stars, and the endless cycle of life and decay. Aeon’s eyes held the knowledge of the ages, yet also a deep melancholy for having to witness the inevitable fate of all things.  Compelled by a force he could not understand, Urukagina reached for his clay tablet and stylus. It was his duty, as a scribe and priest, to record this encounter for posterity. As Aeon spoke his name, Urukagina inscribed it in the ancient script, carefully etching the cuneiform characters that phonetically approximated this timeless name: 𒀀𒌋𒀯.  As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Aeon’s form began to fade. Urukagina knew that this encounter was a rare gift, a glimpse into the vast tapestry of the universe that few would ever see. He also knew the weight of Aeon’s eternal journey, an endless witness to the cycles of existence, a solitary sojourner through the corridors of time.  Urukagina’s encounter with Aeon became a legendary tale, passed down through generations. It served as a reminder of the impermanence of all things and the enduring power of memory and history. For Urukagina, it was a poignant reflection on the fleeting nature of life and the eternal flow of time, a story that he would carry in his heart until his final days.

Kohlrusch  Leipzig 1854  The Chriemhild Trench  A wandering scholar, having learned sorcery in Salamanca1, traveled the world with the devil’s aid. On his journey, he arrived at Türlersee2, where a woman named Chriemhild3 lived. She was known for her beauty but was also wicked and envious, especially of her neighbors’ more fertile lands.  Chriemhild, long desiring to unleash her spite on her neighbors’ property, found the scholar’s arrival opportune. Hoping his magic could render their lands barren, she approached him. The scholar, smitten by her beauty, agreed to her wicked request.  One night, he began digging a large ditch, intending to divert Türlersee’s waters onto the neighbors’ fields, turning their fertile grounds into cold, wet marshland. The malevolent plan was nearly complete, but a pious pilgrim, recognizing the evil deed, intervened. With holy will, he banished the scholar and Chriemhild to Glärnisch4. They were condemned to create a garden on its icy peaks, known as Vreneligärtli or St. Verena’s Garden, named after the pilgrim who was believed to be Saint Verena5. Redemption for the pair will only come upon the garden’s completion, an unlikely event, as unlikely as the completion of the malicious ditch, now known as “Chriemhildengraben.”  Note: On maps, at the end of Türlersee’s southwestern bay, one finds the “Häxengraben” (Witch’s Trench).            Salamanca is a municipality and city in Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile and León.  The origins of the city date back to about 2700 years ago, during the first Iron Age, when the first settlers of the city settled on the San Vicente hill, on the banks of the Tormes. Since then, the metropolis has witnessed the passage of various peoples: Vaccaei, Vettones, Romans, Visigoths and Muslims. Raymond of Burgundy, son-in-law of King Alfonso VI of León, was in charge of repopulating the city.  In 1218, Alfonso IX of León founded the University of Salamanca, the oldest University in Spain, as a studium generale.  It went on to become the of such places in Europe to hold the title of university by royal decree of Alfonso X of Castile dated November 9, 1252 and by the licentia ubique docendi of Pope Alexander IV of 1255. During the time when it was one of the most prestigious universities in the West. &#8617;              There is a legend on how this lake was formed: Where the Türlersee now stretches, in ancient times there lay a beautiful farm with fertile fields. The owner had a single child, a graceful and lovely daughter. She caught the eye of the young lord of Schnabelburg Castle, and he passionately pursued her. However, the honorable girl steadfastly rejected all his promises.  &lt;p&gt; The castle lord then persuaded the father to bring the girl to the castle at midnight under various pretenses. He himself opened the gate and pulled the reluctant girl inside. As he was about to close the gate, she realized what was happening and let out a curse against her treacherous father. At that moment, a fiery lightning bolt struck from the sky, hitting her parental home. She saw a fiery chasm open, and the once splendid and blessed farm with all its fields disappeared into it. By morning, in their place lay a lake. &#8617;              Chriemhild is a form of Kriemhild who is also known as Gurdrun.  She is a major figure in Germanic heroic legend and literature where she is the wife of Sigurd/Siegfried. She is believed to have her origins in Ildico, last wife of Attila the Hun, and two queens of the Merovingian dynasty, Brunhilda of Austrasia and Fredegund.&lt;p&gt;In both the Continental (German) and Scandinavian traditions, Gudrun/Kriemhild is the sister of the Burgundian king Gunther/Gunnar and marries the hero Siegfried/Sigurd. Both traditions also feature a major rivalry between Gudrun and Brunhild, Gunther’s wife, over their respective ranks. In both traditions, once Sigurd has been murdered, Gudrun is married to Etzel/Atli, the legendary analogue of Attila the Hun. In the Norse tradition, Atli desires the hoard of the Nibelungen, which the Burgundians had taken after murdering Sigurd, and invites them to his court; intending to kill them. Gudrun then avenges her brothers by killing Atli and burning down his hall. The Norse tradition then tells of her further life as mother of Svanhild and enemy of Jormunrekr. In the continental tradition, Kriemhild instead desires revenge for her brothers’ murder of Siegfried, and invites them to visit Etzel’s court intending to kill them. Her revenge destroys both the Huns and the Burgundians, and in the end she herself is killed.&lt;p&gt;In Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, Siegfried’s wife is known as Gutrune. As Wagner’s cycle ends with Siegfried’s funeral and its immediate aftermath, it does not include her marriage to Atli/Etzel or revenge for Siegfried’s death. &#8617;              The Glärnisch is a mountain in the Swiss Alps, overlooking the valley of the Linth in the Swiss canton of Glarus. According to local legend, the glacier field at Vrenelisgärtli is where Saint Verena once wanted to create a garden.  It is said that Verena, her garden, and the rock bowl her garden were planted in was eventually buried and has remained there ever since. This cooling of mountain corresponds to the cooling of temperatures in Central Europe from around 1300.  The glacier field completely melted in the summer of 2003, and as of yet, no remnants of Verena, the garden, or the bowl have been found. &#8617;              Verena of Zurzach, mostly just called Saint Verena (c.  260 – c.  320) is an early Christian consecrated virgin and hermit. She is especially venerated in Switzerland, where her cult is attested in Bad Zurzach, the reported place of her burial, from at least the 5th century. She is recognized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church as well as in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Her feast is on 1 September.&lt;p&gt;The oldest tradition of the life of Verena is found in the so-called Vita prior by Hatto, the abbot of Reichenau (and later bishop of Mainz), written in c. 888. The younger Vita posterior was most likely written by a monk in Zurzach in the 11th century, the oldest extant copy dating to the 12th century.&lt;p&gt;According to Hatto’s account, Verena was born in Thebes as the daughter of a notable Christian family. She was educated by a bishop named Chaeremon, who Eusebius recoded as being martyred in 250.&lt;p&gt;After the death of Chaeremon, Verena traveled to Lower Egypt with a group of Christians, where the Theban Legion was being recruited. With the Theban Legion, she then travelled to Milan, in what is today Northern Italy. While still in Milan, she heard of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion, traditionally dated to 286 and traveled to Agaunum, today a city called Saint-Maurice in Switzerland.  Some stories say that she  buried the martyred legionnaires.&lt;p&gt;Verena then moved on to Salodurum, a a city called Solothurn in Switzerland, in a hermitage, and spent her days in fasting and prayer, and working miracles. Hatto presents her as a prototype of the consecrated virgin, saying that she attracted a following of young virgins. She was at one point imprisoned by a local governor, and Saint Maurice appeared to her in jail to console and strengthen her. After she was released, she continued her good works. At the end of her natural days, she retired into a narrow cave.&lt;p&gt;The year of her death was calculated as 344.  If her birth before 250 is accepted, based on the identification of her mentor, bishop Chaeremon, this would imply that she was more than 95 years old at the time of her death. &#8617;      ",

By morning, in their place lay a lake. <a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:3\">      <p>Chriemhild is a form of Kriemhild who is also known as Gurdrun.  She is a major figure in Germanic heroic legend and literature where she is the wife of Sigurd/Siegfried. She is believed to have her origins in Ildico, last wife of Attila the Hun, and two queens of the Merovingian dynasty, Brunhilda of Austrasia and Fredegund.&lt;p&gt;In both the Continental (German) and Scandinavian traditions, Gudrun/Kriemhild is the sister of the Burgundian king Gunther/Gunnar and marries the hero Siegfried/Sigurd. Both traditions also feature a major rivalry between Gudrun and Brunhild, Gunther’s wife, over their respective ranks. In both traditions, once Sigurd has been murdered, Gudrun is married to Etzel/Atli, the legendary analogue of Attila the Hun. In the Norse tradition, Atli desires the hoard of the Nibelungen, which the Burgundians had taken after murdering Sigurd, and invites them to his court; intending to kill them. Gudrun then avenges her brothers by killing Atli and burning down his hall. The Norse tradition then tells of her further life as mother of Svanhild and enemy of Jormunrekr. In the continental tradition, Kriemhild instead desires revenge for her brothers’ murder of Siegfried, and invites them to visit Etzel’s court intending to kill them. Her revenge destroys both the Huns and the Burgundians, and in the end she herself is killed.&lt;p&gt;In Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, Siegfried’s wife is known as Gutrune. As Wagner’s cycle ends with Siegfried’s funeral and its immediate aftermath, it does not include her marriage to Atli/Etzel or revenge for Siegfried’s death. <a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:4\">      <p>The Glärnisch is a mountain in the Swiss Alps, overlooking the valley of the Linth in the Swiss canton of Glarus. According to local legend, the glacier field at Vrenelisgärtli is where Saint Verena once wanted to create a garden.  It is said that Verena, her garden, and the rock bowl her garden were planted in was eventually buried and has remained there ever since. This cooling of mountain corresponds to the cooling of temperatures in Central Europe from around 1300.  The glacier field completely melted in the summer of 2003, and as of yet, no remnants of Verena, the garden, or the bowl have been found. <a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:5\">      <p>Verena of Zurzach, mostly just called Saint Verena (c.  260 – c.  320) is an early Christian consecrated virgin and hermit. She is especially venerated in Switzerland, where her cult is attested in Bad Zurzach, the reported place of her burial, from at least the 5th century. She is recognized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church as well as in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Her feast is on 1 September.&lt;p&gt;The oldest tradition of the life of Verena is found in the so-called <em>Vita prior</em> by Hatto, the abbot of Reichenau (and later bishop of Mainz), written in c. 888. The younger <em>Vita posterior</em> was most likely written by a monk in Zurzach in the 11th century, the oldest extant copy dating to the 12th century.&lt;p&gt;According to Hatto’s account, Verena was born in Thebes as the daughter of a notable Christian family. She was educated by a bishop named Chaeremon, who Eusebius recoded as being martyred in 250.&lt;p&gt;After the death of Chaeremon, Verena traveled to Lower Egypt with a group of Christians, where the Theban Legion was being recruited. With the Theban Legion, she then travelled to Milan, in what is today Northern Italy. While still in Milan, she heard of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion, traditionally dated to 286 and traveled to Agaunum, today a city called Saint-Maurice in Switzerland.  Some stories say that she  buried the martyred legionnaires.&lt;p&gt;Verena then moved on to Salodurum, a a city called Solothurn in Switzerland, in a hermitage, and spent her days in fasting and prayer, and working miracles. Hatto presents her as a prototype of the consecrated virgin, saying that she attracted a following of young virgins. She was at one point imprisoned by a local governor, and Saint Maurice appeared to her in jail to console and strengthen her. After she was released, she continued her good works. At the end of her natural days, she retired into a narrow cave.&lt;p&gt;The year of her death was calculated as 344.  If her birth before 250 is accepted, based on the identification of her mentor, bishop Chaeremon, this would imply that she was more than 95 years old at the time of her death. <a href=\"#fnref:5\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>  </ol></div>",

Rochholz  Aarau, 1856  Page 187  The Bailiff of Brunnegg  When a change in weather is due and especially as the holy season approaches, people at the foot of Brunnegg1 hear a persistent tumult above at the castle. It is said that the bailiff2  rides out on his steed (a black horse) for a hunt. He once did this in the harshest winter with his pack of dogs3 and a retinue of attendants. Their feet froze in the cold, and then the bailiff found a poor woodcutter, killed him, and warmed his freezing feet in the opened belly of the corpse. From that moment on, a terrible snowstorm broke out, sweeping and burying them all together; none returned to the castle. The spot where the poor peasant died is still known; the hunting rider gallops up to there, and there his huntsman’s cry of “Hop-Hop!” falls silent.  Well-read people call him Gessler4 and believe he is the same man who forced Tell to shoot at his own child.  As noted by: T. Tschopp  General Information      Title: The Bailiff of Brunnegg    Author: Ernst L. Rochholz    Source: Swiss Legends from Aargau, Volume 1, published in 1856    Location: Brunnegg, Aargau, Switzerland    Plot Points      Setting: Takes place at Brunnegg Castle, with an emphasis on harsh winter conditions.    Main Character: The bailiff of Brunnegg, depicted as a cruel and ghostly figure.    Incident: The bailiff kills a poor woodcutter to warm his feet in the man’s belly during a hunting expedition.    Supernatural Elements: A terrible snowstorm ensues, believed to have buried the bailiff and his entourage.    End Scene: The legend concludes with the ghostly bailiff’s hunting cries falling silent at the spot where the woodcutter died.    Beliefs about the Event      The story is considered a legend, blending historical characters with folklore and supernatural elements.    The bailiff is sometimes identified with Gessler, a figure from the William Tell saga, indicating a possible overlap of legends or a common theme of tyrannical rulers in Swiss folklore.    Cultural Context      Historical Backdrop: Reflects the medieval period in Switzerland, highlighting the conflicts and dynamics between local populations and ruling nobility (like the Habsburgs).    Themes: Explores themes of cruelty, justice, and supernatural retribution.    Cultural Significance: Represents a narrative of resistance against tyranny, a common theme in Swiss folklore, which contributes to Switzerland’s national identity and history.    Representation in Art and Literature: The story is part of Swiss cultural heritage, often depicted in literature and art, reflecting the broader theme of struggle for autonomy and freedom in Swiss history.              Brunegg Castle, known as Schloss Brunegg in German, is located in the municipality of Brunegg, in the canton of Aargau, Switzerland. Constructed in the 13th century on a hill at the edge of the Jura Mountains, the castle was likely built as part of the Habsburg border defenses, along with nearby Wildegg Castle. It was occupied by Habsburg knights, including the notable Schenken von Brunegg and Gessler von Meienberg.      In 1415, during a period of regional conflicts, Brunegg Castle was besieged by Bernese troops, but the siege was lifted following a counterattack. Subsequently, Bern conquered the Aargau region and granted the fief of the castle to the Segenser or Segesser family. From 1538 to 1798, the castle was under the control of the governor of Lenzburg.      In 1815, the Hünerwadel family from Lenzburg became the owners of the castle. Later, it passed into the hands of the von Salis family through marriage. The castle suffered from poor maintenance over the centuries and was severely damaged by storms in the 17th century. However, in the early 19th century, restoration efforts were undertaken to repair the keep, outbuildings, and roof【24†source】【25†source】. &#8617;              During the medieval period in Switzerland, a bailiff, known in German as a “Vogt,” played a significant administrative and judicial role. The bailiff was typically a nobleman appointed by a higher authority, such as a king, duke, or lord. Their responsibilities included:                        Administration: Bailiffs were responsible for overseeing the administration of the lands or territories under their jurisdiction. This included collecting taxes, managing estates, and overseeing local governance.                          Judicial Duties: They often had judicial powers and were responsible for maintaining law and order. This could include presiding over local courts and enforcing legal decisions.                          Military Leadership: In some cases, bailiffs also had military responsibilities, such as defending the territory, maintaining a militia, and overseeing local security.                          Representation: They represented the interests of the lord or ruling authority in the local area, acting as a liaison between the local populace and the higher nobility or royalty.                    The role of a bailiff was crucial in maintaining the feudal system, ensuring that the interests of the ruling class were upheld in the localities, and in administering justice and order in their respective regions. &#8617;              In medieval Europe, including Switzerland during the time period of the “Bailiff of Brunnegg” story, several types of dogs were commonly used for hunting:                        Hounds: These were perhaps the most common type of hunting dogs. They were used for their strong sense of smell to track game. Breeds like Bloodhounds and various types of scent hounds were popular.                          Mastiffs: These large, powerful dogs were often used for hunting larger game due to their strength and tenacity.                          Greyhounds: Known for their speed and agility, greyhounds were used for coursing game, especially in open areas.                          Pointers and Setters: Although they became more popular later, these breeds were beginning to be used for their ability to locate and ‘point’ to game, particularly birds.                          Spaniels: Used for flushing game out of dense underbrush, spaniels were versatile and could work in a variety of terrains.                    The specific breed used would depend on the type of game being hunted and the local terrain. Hunting dogs were highly valued and often depicted in medieval art and literature as noble companions in the hunt. &#8617;              Albrecht Gessler is a legendary figure in Swiss history, famously known for his role in the William Tell saga. According to the legend, Gessler was a tyrannical bailiff appointed by the Habsburgs in the early 14th century to rule over parts of Switzerland. His most notorious act, as depicted in the legend, was his order for William Tell to shoot an apple off his son’s head, a task which Tell successfully accomplished. This incident is said to have sparked a rebellion that led to the formation of the Swiss Confederation. Gessler is often portrayed as a symbol of Habsburg5 oppression in Swiss folklore. The historical accuracy of Gessler’s existence and his actions is debated, as much of his story is rooted in legend rather than documented history. &#8617;              The Habsburgs were a prominent royal dynasty in Europe who played a significant role in the history of Switzerland. Originating from the region that is now Austria, the Habsburgs expanded their influence into various parts of Europe, including Switzerland, through conquest and marriage alliances.      In Switzerland, the Habsburgs were seen as foreign rulers and their attempts to consolidate power often clashed with the growing desire for autonomy among the Swiss cantons. This tension led to several conflicts, most notably the Swiss struggle for independence, which included famous events like the legend of William Tell. The Swiss eventually won their independence from Habsburg control, which was a key step in the formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, the precursor to modern Switzerland. The Habsburgs’ rule over Swiss territories is often remembered for its authoritarian nature and is a significant part of Swiss national identity and history. &#8617;      ",

            "summary": "This folktale from the Schächental valley in Uri tells the story of how a miraculous well came to be, thanks to the intervention of a mysterious traveler and the faith of the local people.",
            
            "content_text": "   Legends from Uri 1-3. Vols. 1-2 ed. Hanns Bächtold-Stäubli; Vol. 3 ed. Robert Wildhaber.  by Josef  Müller  Basel: G. Krebs, 1926  The Well at Schwanden  In the Schächental Valley, it is impossible to sink a well, not even with mercury1. In olden times, there was no well water there. Therefore, the people began to pray to St. Anna 2, the patron saint of the chapel. One evening, a beggar came and asked for a place to stay overnight. The people kindly took him in, but said that if he should be thirsty, he would have to provide water himself in God’s name, as they had none in the house. He said that by tomorrow, they would have water. In the early morning, the beggar had already left, and next to the house flowed a magnificent little fountain with clear water, which subsequently never dried up and never froze, even in winter.            Sinking a well with mercury is not a practical or environmentally sound method. In fact, it’s not used in modern well construction. The mention of mercury in the folktale “Der Brunnen zu Schwanden” is likely metaphorical or symbolic, illustrating the difficulty or impossibility of sinking a well in that particular area.

One evening, a beggar came and asked for a place to stay overnight. The people kindly took him in, but said that if he should be thirsty, he would have to provide water himself in God’s name, as they had none in the house. He said that by tomorrow, they would have water.

He comes from a modest family; his father, Yusuf, is a fisherman, and his mother, Fatima, is a homemaker. Ahmed has two younger sisters, Aisha and Leila, who are still in school. His family is supportive but doesn't fully understand the significance of the work he is involved in at the House of Wisdom.Role-Playing Notes:Ahmed is honest and dutiful but may be a bit naive when it comes to the complexities of scholarly debates or political intrigue. He takes great pride in his work, knowing that even though he doesn't understand the texts he carries, he plays a part in the greater pursuit of knowledge. With his enhanced strength, agility, and resilience, Ahmed is more than capable of defending himself and has even picked up some basic knifefighting skills.Local Folklore Ahmed ibn Yusuf Believes In:Ahmed ibn Yusuf, being a man of the people and deeply rooted in the local culture of Baghdad, believes in a variety of folklore that has been passed down through generations. Here's a summary of some of the local folklore he might believe in:Jinn and SpiritsAhmed believes in the existence of Jinn, supernatural beings that can be either benevolent or malevolent. He thinks they inhabit remote or hidden places and can influence human affairs. He may carry amulets or charms to protect himself from their influence.The Legend of the Tigris RiverAhmed believes that the Tigris River, which flows through Baghdad, is a source of both life and mystery. Folk tales speak of ancient spirits that dwell within the river and control its flow. Some say that making offerings to these spirits can bring good fortune.  Creation Myths: The Tigris, along with the Euphrates, featured prominently in Mesopotamian creation myths. They were considered to be the rivers that flowed from the Garden of Eden, which in many Islamic interpretations was thought to be a real place on Earth.  Gilgamesh Epic: By the 1200s, the Epic of Gilgamesh would have been ancient but still influential. In this epic, the Tigris River serves as a setting for several adventures, including the pursuit of the sacred Cedar Forest and the search for immortality by Gilgamesh.  Islamic Historical Narratives: In Islamic tradition, the Tigris would be known as one of the rivers of Paradise, and several hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) mention the rivers of Eden, which would be interpreted by many as the Tigris and Euphrates.  The Flood Story: Legends of the Great Flood, similar to the story of Noah’s Ark in the Abrahamic traditions (known as Nuh in the Quran), would also be linked to the Tigris as such floods were common in the river’s history, and stories of ancient floods were often localized by the people living along its banks.  Iskandar: Legends of Iskandar (Alexander the Great) often involved his journeys near or along the Tigris River, including encounters with mythical creatures and divine interventions.  Persian and Arab Conquests: There would be numerous stories about the strategic importance of the Tigris in various military campaigns, including the Arab conquests that brought Islam to the region and the battles fought along its banks.  Sassanian Empire Legends: Stories from the time of the Sassanian empire, the last pre-Islamic Persian empire, would include tales of battles and the famed Nahrawan Canal, a feat of engineering that channeled the waters of the Tigris.  The jinn: Folktales involving jinn (supernatural beings in Islamic mythology) often took place near rivers like the Tigris, where they were said to live, interact with humans, or influence events.  Local Folk Heroes: By this time, the Tigris River region had seen centuries of civilization, and each period likely contributed its own heroes and notable figures, from ancient kings to contemporary leaders, whose exploits became the stuff of local legend.The Cursed RuinsThere are ruins around Baghdad that are said to be cursed, often linked to stories of lost civilizations or fallen empires. Ahmed would avoid these places, especially after dark, believing that malevolent spirits or curses could harm those who venture too close.The Wisdom of the Bayt al-ḤikmahGiven his work at the House of Wisdom, Ahmed might believe that the scholars and texts there possess magical or divine qualities. Some local tales suggest that the Bayt al-Ḥikmah was built on an ancient site of power, and its scholars are the guardians of arcane secrets.The Protective Qualities of Certain SymbolsAhmed believes in the protective power of certain symbols and phrases, such as the Hand of Fatima or specific Quranic verses. He thinks that these can ward off evil and bring good luck, which is why he always carries a \"lucky charm.\"Phrases:  Masha'Allah (\"God has willed it\") - Used to show appreciation for a person or object and to ward off the evil eye.  Insha'Allah (\"If God wills\") - Used when speaking about plans or future events to invite divine favor.  Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim (\"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\") - Often said before undertaking any action to seek God's blessings.  La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (\"There is no power and no strength except through God\") - Used to seek divine assistance in times of difficulty.Symbols:  Hand of Fatima (Hamsa) - A palm-shaped amulet popular throughout the Middle East for protection against the evil eye.  Crescent Moon and Star - Commonly seen as a symbol of Islam and believed to offer protection.

Fish Symbol - Fish are often considered a symbol of good luck and prosperity.The Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr)Ahmed holds a strong belief in the Night of Power, a night during the Islamic month of Ramadan that is said to be \"better than a thousand months.\" He believes that prayers and good deeds performed on this night have a magnified impact.Folk Heroes and Local SaintsAhmed believes in the stories of folk heroes who fought against injustice or local saints who performed miracles. These figures are often invoked in daily life as symbols of virtue and courage.Ahmed ibn Yusuf might visit the shrines of these local saints to seek blessings, and he would certainly know the tales of these folk heroes, drawing inspiration from their virtues and deeds.Folk Heroes:  Hatim al-Tai - Known for his incredible generosity and hospitality, Hatim al-Tai is a pre-Islamic Arab hero whose stories are still told to emphasize the importance of these virtues.  Antarah ibn Shaddad - A pre-Islamic Arab knight and poet, famous for both his bravery in battle and his forbidden love for his cousin Abla.  Aladdin - Though the tale has been popularized worldwide, many in the region still consider Aladdin a folk hero who used his wit and a magical lamp to rise from poverty.  Sindbad the Sailor - A legendary sailor and adventurer from Baghdad who embarks on seven fantastical journeys, encountering mythical creatures and discovering magical lands.  Ali Baba - Known for the tale of \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" he is considered a clever commoner who outsmarts a band of thieves to uncover their treasure.Local Saints:  Imam Ali - The first cousin of the Prophet Muhammad and a central figure in Shia Islam, Imam Ali is revered for his piety, justice, and courage.  Rabia al-Adawiyya - A female Muslim saint and Sufi mystic from Basra, revered for her deep devotion to God and her teachings on divine love.

Imam al-Kazim - The seventh Shia Imam, buried in the Kazimain shrine in Baghdad, is considered a saint and is revered for his piety and wisdom.  Al-Hallaj - A controversial Sufi mystic executed for his unorthodox teachings, but later revered as a martyr who died for the love of God.Omens and SuperstitionsAhmed pays attention to various omens and signs, such as the flight patterns of birds or the appearance of a new moon, believing they can foretell future events or indicate God's will.These beliefs, rooted in local folklore and traditions, shape Ahmed's worldview and influence his daily actions and decisions.Ahmed would likely interpret these omens and superstitions as signs or messages from the divine, or as indicators of the natural order of things. They would influence his daily actions and decisions, prompting him to take caution or proceed with confidence depending on the signs he observes.Omens:  Flight of Birds - Observing the direction in which a flock of birds flies could be seen as an omen. A flight towards the right might be considered a good omen, while towards the left could be seen as a bad sign.  Shooting Stars - A shooting star could be seen as a sign that God is answering someone's prayers, or that a significant change is about to happen.  Lunar Eclipses - An eclipse might be considered a warning of impending disaster or divine displeasure, prompting people to pray and seek forgiveness.  Crossing Paths with a Black Cat - While in some cultures this is considered bad luck, in others it might be seen as a sign to be extra cautious or aware of one's surroundings.  Finding a Lost Object - Stumbling upon a lost object like a coin or a piece of jewelry could be seen as a sign of good luck or divine favor.Superstitions:  Evil Eye - The belief that envy or malevolent glances can bring misfortune. Ahmed would likely carry an amulet or charm to protect against it.  Knocking on Wood - To prevent disappointment or jinxing a positive outcome, Ahmed might knock on wood after making a hopeful statement.  Spilling Salt - If salt is spilled, throwing a pinch over the left shoulder is believed to ward off bad luck or evil spirits.  Breaking Bread - It's considered good luck to break bread with someone rather than cutting it, symbolizing friendship and unity.  Sneezing Odd Number of Times - An odd number of sneezes might be considered a good sign, while an even number could be seen as an omen of something negative.Map of Baghdad by UnknownMap of Baghdad by UnknownMap of Baghdad 722-922Trade Networks of the 1200sMongol Army Path of Attack",

You may also use your Influence skills on animals just as you would on  sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ||      Empathic Healing: |  15   | (to aid injured mundane and magical beings) - You  have the ability to heal others by taking on the  injuries, diseases, and Afflictions by removing instead of paying FP. You must be in physical contact with the subject. To activate your power, concentrate for one second and make an IQ roll.  Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious. Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP (which is removed until you are healed) per 2 HP healed (round up).  Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d  damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to he crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM – from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty,  minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. If  used more than once per day on a given subject,  apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of  the same type (injury or disease) on that subject.

When faced with a number of alternatives, and no logical way to choose among them, you can ask the GM to let you use your Intuition. The GM makes a secret IQ roll, with a bonus equal to the number of “good” choices and a penalty equal to the number of “bad” choices. On a success, he steers you to a good choice; on a critical success, he tells you the best choice. On a failure, he gives you no information; on a critical failure, he steers you toward a bad choice. The GM can modify this as he sees fit for other situaKons where IntuiKon might logically help. Only one roll per quesKon is allowed. The GM should never allow IntuiKon to short-circuit an adventure – for instance, by lesng the intuiKve detecKve walk into a room, slap the cuffs on the guilty party, and close the case. At the most, IntuiKon would point the detecKve in the direcKon of a good clue.

You will never betray them, abandon them when theyʼre in trouble, or let them suffer or go hungry if you can help. This is different from a Duty (p. 133), which is imposed upon you. A Sense of Duty always comes from within. If you are known to have a Sense of Duty, the GM will adjust the reactions of others by +2 when rolling to see whether they trust you in a dangerous situation. However, if you go against your Sense of Duty by acting against the interests of those you are supposed to be looking out for, the GM will penalize you for bad roleplaying. You cannot claim points for a Sense of Duty toward Allies, Dependents, or Patrons. The point costs of these traits already take such a bond into account. You can take a Sense of Duty toward adventuring companions. If you do, you must share equipment with and render aid to the other members of your adventuring party, and go along with majority decisions. The GM might make this mandatory in games where the party needs to get along. This gives everyone a “free” 5 points to spend . . . but if you start backstabbing, running off on your own, etc., the GM is free to overrule your actions and point to these bonus points as the reason why. || Curious          | -5    | (drawn to mystical knowledge) - You are naturally very inquisitive. This is not the curiosity that affects all PCs (“Whatʼs in that cave? Where did the flying saucer come from?”), but the real thing (“What happens if I push this button?”). Make a self-control roll when presented with an interesting item or situation. If you fail, you examine it, push buttons, pull levers, open doors, unwrap presents, etc. – even if you know it could be dangerous. Good roleplayers wonʼt try to make this roll very often… In general, you do everything in your power to investigate any situation with which you arenʼt 100% familiar. When faced with a real mystery, you simply cannot turn your back on it. You try to rationalize your curiosity to others who try to talk you out of it. Common Sense doesnʼt help – you know you are taking a risk, but youʼre curious anyway!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         || Code of Honor    | -10   | (Protect Innocents) - This code requires the character to prioritize the safety and well-being of innocent people, intervening to prevent harm, avoid collateral damage, and seek justice for crimes against them. It demands respect for human life and dignity, active assistance to those in need, and reporting crimes witnessed. The character must endure personal hardship for the sake of innocents, avoid harming children under any circumstances, and provide aid while respecting the sanctity of life, even in the face of personal danger or adversity. Breaking this code may lead to moral dilemmas and penalties, but adhering to it offers opportunities for heroic actions and role-playing moments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             || Weirdness Magnet | -15   | (attracts supernatural events) - Strange and bizarre things happen to you with alarming frequency. You are the one demons stop and chat with. Magic items with disturbing properties find their way to you. The only talking dog on 21st-century Earth comes to you with his problems. Dimensional gates sealed for centuries crack open just so that you can be bathed in the energies released… or perhaps the entities on the other side invite you to tea. Nothing lethal happens to you, at least not immediately, and occasionally some weirdness is beneficial. But most of the time it is terribly, terribly inconvenient. People who understand what a Weirdness Magnet is (and that you are one) react to you at -2. The exceptions are parapsychologists, fringe cultists, unhinged conspiracy theorists, and thrill-seekers, who follow you around!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   || Phantom Voices   | -5    | (occasionally hears voices of nature and the Djinn) - You hear the voices of nature and the Djinn, but you have learned to integrate their voices into your day-to-day life, and in general these creatures and forces are not malicious. These whispers can sometimes provide insights or warnings, but they can also be distracting and disturbing, leading to difficulty concentrating or sleeping. You must make a self-control roll in stressful situations or when you need to focus. If you fail, the voices overwhelm your thoughts, potentially causing you to act irrationally or miss important details. Most people who see you responding to these noises that they can’t hear will react at -2. If these voices persist, eventually, your sanity will start to erode. In any situation that the GM feels is stressful, they may roll 3d. On a 6 or less, you hear voices. The GM will always roll whenever you miss a Fright Check or make the roll exactly, and whenever you fail a self-control roll for another stress-related disadvantage. The voices occur in addition to any other results!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    || Sense of Duty    | -10   | (Protect Magical Beings) The GM rolls (Quite often/Hazardous - roll of 12 or less) at the beginning of each adventure to see whether it comes into play. Being “called to duty” could delay your plans… or be the reason for the adventure! Alternatively, your master might give you a secret agenda to pursue, or his associates might harass you while you are officially “on leave.” If you try to avoid your Duty, your GM is within their rights to penalize you for bad role playing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      || Vow              | -10   | (Protect and Resettle Magical Beings) You have sworn an oath to Protect and Resettle Magical Beings and you take it seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |{.well .table .table-striped}Quirks:| Quirk                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ||——————————————|———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–|| Night Owl                            | Mehmet often finds himself most active and alert during the late hours of the night, which can sometimes lead to unconventional sleep patterns.                                                                                                                       || Keeps a Lucky Charm                  | He carries a small, seemingly insignificant item as a lucky charm, believing it brings him good fortune and protection.                                                                                                                                               || Fascination with Celestial Phenomena | Mehmet has an intense fascination with celestial phenomena, such as stars, planets, and eclipses.

For instance, a fantasy occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without Thaumatology skill, he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        || Thaumatology              | 14         | This is the academic study of magical theory and the “physics” of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells. The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide. This is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 || Hidden Lore               | 14         | (Mysticism) This skill represents knowledge that is lost, deliberately hidden, or simply neglected. Whatever the reason, the general public is unaware of it. It is only available to those who study it specifically. You must specialize in a particular body of secret knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters… or to PCs in general! To acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts—such as reading moldy tomes—instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill. Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       || Research                  | 13         | This is the skill to do library and file research.

Roll against Brawling to hit with a punch, or Brawling-2 to hit with a kick. Brawling can also replace DX when you attack with teeth, claws, horns, or other “natural weapons.” Brawling improves damage: if you know Brawling at DX+2 level or better, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Brawling attacks – punches, kicks, claws, bites, etc. Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet. Brawling includes the ability to use the blackjack or sap. An attack with such a fist load is considered a punch at +1 to damage. When you defend with bare hands, Brawling allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Brawling parries are at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                || Survival                  | 12         | This is the skill to “live off the land,” find safe food and water,avoid hazards, build shelter, etc. You may look after up to 10 other people. To live safely in a wilderness situation, you must make a successful Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care; roll separately for each victim. This skill also gives an “eye for country.” A successful roll shows you the best direction of travel to find flowing water, a mountain pass, or whatever other terrain feature you desire – assuming that it exists. Finally, you can use this skill to trap wild animals. (A city-bred thief could use Traps skill, but heʼs used to differentgame...sotherollwouldbeata -5.) Make one roll per trap. It takes about 30 minutes to improvise a trap from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes to set and hide a commercial steel trap. Pit traps for large game take several hours to dig. Survival often requires skill rolls based on scores other than Perception. The GM might ask for a ST-based roll to dig a pit trap or erect (Desert): a log shelter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using primitive techniques (flint sparking, bow and palette, etc.), or even a HT- based roll to avoid nutritional defi- ciencies from an improvised diet. Land specialties default to one another at -3, while aquatic specialties default among themselves at -4. Island/Beach and Tropical Lagoon default to each other at -4, as do Swampland and River/Stream, but there are no other defaults between land and aquatic specialties. In settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also spe- cialize by planet. Each Survival spe- cialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different plan- ets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types. || Leadership                | 12         | This is the skill to coordinate a group. Make a Leadership roll to lead NPCs into a dangerous or stressful situation. (PCs can decide for themselves if they want to follow you!) You may attempt a Leadership roll in combat if you spend your turn doing nothing but giving orders and encouragement. On a success, everyone on your side who can hear you (including PCs) has +1 on all combat-related Fright Checks and morale checks, and on self-control rolls for disadvantages that would reduce combat efficiency (such as Berserk and Cowardice – or Bloodlust, if you wish to take prisoners). A critical success gives +2. The bonus lasts until your next turn, at which time you may roll again. A group can have only one leader, however! If multiple people attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a bonus. Note that a minimum level of Leadership is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29). Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma (p. 41); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154). -5 if the NPCs have never been in action with you; -5 if you are sending them into danger but not going yourself; +5 if their loyalty to you is “Good”; +10 if their loyalty is “Very Good.” If their loyalty is “Excellent,” you do not have to roll!

Prior to this closure, inquiries were made to the Ottoman delegation regarding Al-Mansur’s official position and responsibilities. The delegation confirmed that Al-Mansur is part of the team working on the peaceful dissolution of the empire and the establishment of the Turkish state, with his specific role being to establish a long-term presence for citizens of the former empire in Paris.Al-Mansur, who is known to have an interest in astronomy—or astrology, as some suggest—is also a collector of various artifacts, including unique objects, scrolls, and natural curiosities. He is noted for his open and welcoming demeanor towards individuals from diverse backgrounds, dedicating much of his time to cataloging items in Parisian museums and libraries.During a covert inspection of his residence on February 13th, conducted under the guise of a routine building inspection, it was observed that his house is filled with papers and flyers related to talks given by esoteric scholars like R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and René Guénon. Additionally, documents were found indicating that he has engaged in extensive debates with an individual known as Chioa Khan, who resides in Cefalù, Sicily.Throughout the week-long surveillance, Al-Mansur engaged in no activities that could be construed as illicit or suspicious. His behavior was consistent with his cultural and scholarly interests, and there was no evidence to suggest any involvement in activities that would warrant further police attention. The Ottoman delegation’s corroboration of his scholarly and cultural pursuits further dispelled any doubts regarding his conduct. As such, the case on Mehmet Al-Mansur has been concluded and the files marked for closure.Places Visited:  Café de la Lumière (Café): Frequent morning visits for reading and coffee.

This secluded lodge is a conundrum wrapped in enigma, where the martial prowess of the Ottoman Empire’s elite soldiers is woven with the clandestine threads of the arcane. The very existence of the Dergahı is known only to the Sultan’s inner circle and to those who have gazed upon its storied walls and walked its hallowed halls.The Dergahı is not merely a place; it is a crucible where the flesh and spirit are refined through trials that would fray the souls of lesser men. Here, the Yeniçerileri are reborn, not as mere soldiers of the empire, but as vassals of a higher calling where the weave of magic becomes the sinew of war. The training within these walls transcends the conventional; it is a sacred synthesis of ancient wisdom and the art of war, a legacy left by a lineage of warrior-mages who served the empire from the shadows.Initiates, handpicked from the ranks for their valor and affinity for the mystical, are subjected to a regimen that marries the sword with the spell. Days are marked by the rhythmic chants of spellcraft echoing alongside the clangor of steel. Nights are spent in contemplative study under the watchful eyes of the Dergahı’s masters, the Sihirbaz Ustaları, whose knowledge of the occult is as profound as their martial skill is deadly.The secrets imparted upon the acolytes of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are as old as the empire itself, rooted in a belief that the world is a tapestry of seen and unseen forces that can be harnessed by the worthy. The adepts learn to channel the latent energies of the cosmos, invoking spells that shield their brethren, confound their enemies, and cloak their movements in a shroud of secrecy. This mystical warfare is not for the faint of heart; it requires an iron will to bend the arcane forces without succumbing to their seductive call.But the Dergahı is more than a school of war magic; it is a brotherhood, where bonds forged in the crucible of arcane and martial rigors transcend the ordinary. The Yeniçerileri who emerge from the Dergahı do so as envoys of a legacy as enduring as the empire they serve. They are the unseen shield and the hidden blade, the quiet guardians of the realm who walk where shadows dwell, armed with the knowledge that their art is the empire’s secret bastion against the chaos that lurks beyond the light of civilization.In the annals of the empire, the deeds of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are seldom sung, for their triumphs are the victories that the world must never know, achieved in silence, preserved in the quietude of the Dergahı’s sacred grounds.AwardsThe enigmatic members of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique duality within the Ottoman Empire, navigating two distinct but interconnected realms of recognition and honor. As dedicated agents of espionage and intelligence, they were shrouded in secrecy, wielding their mystical arts to safeguard the empire’s interests. Yet, their affiliation with the Ottoman Imperial Military added an additional layer of complexity to their service. These shadowy figures, while masters of deception, also marched alongside their fellow soldiers on the battlefield. This dual allegiance allowed them to straddle two worlds, where they could earn accolades and awards from both organizations. Thus, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique blend of martial prowess and covert expertise, a testament to their multifaceted contributions within the empire’s complex tapestry of recognition and distinction.Awards of the Ottoman Emperal MilitaryIn the crucible of World War I, the Ottoman Empire’s military personnel demonstrated unwavering valor and dedication in the face of adversity. Their commitment and gallantry were recognized through a series of distinguished military awards and honors, each carrying its own unique significance.  In the turbulent aftermath of World War I and the dawn of the Turkish War of Independence, additional medals and awards awaited those who continued to champion the cause, striving for the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. These accolades, coupled with special commendations and promotions, illuminated the path to honor for those whose exceptional contributions shaped the destiny of a nation.      Imtiyaz Medal: This Ottoman medal was awarded for distinguished service and meritorious conduct. It had different classes, including gold and silver, depending on the level of distinction.        Liakat Medal: Similar to the Imtiyaz Medal, the Liakat Medal was awarded for outstanding service and gallantry. It also had various classes.        Order of the Medjidie: This was a prestigious Ottoman order that recognized distinguished service to the empire. It had several classes, with the First Class being the highest.        Ottoman War Medal (Harb Madalyası): This medal was given to military personnel for their participation in wartime service, including battles during World War I.        Military Merit Medal: Awarded for exceptional acts of valor and bravery during military operations.        Long Service Medals: Ottoman military personnel who had served for an extended period of time with good conduct could be eligible for long service medals.        Turkish War of Independence Medals: For those who continued to serve in the Turkish War of Independence (after World War I), there were additional medals and awards available for their contributions to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.        Special Commendations: In addition to medals, individuals might have received special commendations or promotions for their exceptional performance in battles.  It’s important to note that the specific awards and decorations individuals received would depend on their rank, role, and the circumstances of their service in these battles. Additionally, some of these honors might have been retroactively awarded by the Republic of Turkey to recognize the contributions of individuals who later played pivotal roles in the establishment of the modern Turkish state, such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.Awards of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri DergahıIn the intricate world of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri, a unique system of recognition and accolades emerged to honor those who served as guardians of secrecy, masters of deception, and sentinels of intelligence. In their clandestine pursuits on behalf of the empire, they created the esteemed “Order of the Mystic Crescent.” This prestigious order stood as a testament to the exceptional service rendered by its members, marking them as unsung heroes in the fields of espionage, subterfuge, and intelligence gathering. It was a realm where valor lay in subtlety, and cunning was the highest form of bravery.      Order of the Mystic Crescent: This prestigious order could recognize the exceptional service of Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri in the fields of espionage, deception, and intelligence gathering. It might have different classes, with higher classes representing more significant contributions.        Medal of Subterfuge: This medal could be awarded to members who have demonstrated outstanding skills in the art of disguise, infiltrating enemy lines, and gathering critical information without detection.        Sultan’s Secret Service Star: A star-shaped award, symbolizing the clandestine nature of their work, could be given to those who have made significant contributions to the security and intelligence of the empire.        Crescent Moon Commendation: This commendation could be given for exceptional achievements in the use of illusion and misdirection to deceive and confuse adversaries on the battlefield or in espionage operations.        Order of the Silent Shadows: This order might recognize those who have excelled in the art of remaining unnoticed and unheard while carrying out their covert missions.        Janissary Magician’s Cross: A cross-shaped award could be given to individuals who have displayed exceptional courage and resourcefulness while executing their espionage duties.        Serpent’s Scales Medal: This medal might represent the ability to navigate treacherous political waters and gather critical intelligence from within enemy organizations or foreign courts.        Ottoman Intelligence Star: An exclusive star-shaped decoration for outstanding contributions to Ottoman intelligence, including the strategic use of information to benefit the empire.  Classes of AwardsThis is an example of the hierarchy of recognition within the Order of the Mystic Crescent, reflecting the varying levels of expertise, experience, and dedication of its members. Advancement through the classes would typically depend on an individual’s performance, achievements, and years of service, with promotions and awards granted accordingly.      Mystic Crescent, First Class: This would be the highest and most prestigious class, awarded for exceptional and sustained contributions to intelligence gathering, espionage, and deception. Recipients at this level would have demonstrated exceptional skill, leadership, and dedication to the cause.

Members at this level would have demonstrated proficiency and a commitment to the organization’s mission.        Mystic Crescent, Fifth Class: The entry-level class, recognizing individuals who have successfully completed training and have begun their service in the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri or a similar group. This class acknowledges their potential and commitment to developing their skills.  RulesSkill Name: War Arcana (VH)Default: None.Prerequisite: Magery 0; must have attended a Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı.Description/Background:The Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri, or “Wizard Janissaries,” are an elite cadre within the Ottoman military structure, trained specifically to blend the arts of war with mystical prowess. Originating from the most promising of recruits, these individuals undergo a secretive and arduous bootcamp, emerging as both officers and clandestine operatives who can bend the weave of magic to the Empire’s will.During this bootcamp, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri are introduced to the ancient practices of War Arcana, a skill that allows them to cast spells swiftly and silently amidst the chaos of battle. This training involves not only rigorous mental conditioning to withstand the fog of war but also a deep spiritual connection to the latent energies manipulated during combat. The secrets of War Arcana are closely guarded, passed down only to those who have proven both their loyalty and their valor.Rules:War Arcana is a Very Hard skill that represents the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri’s ability to effectively use spells in the heat of battle. It allows the casting of any spell known by the character without the usual verbal, somatic, or material components typically required, thus enabling the user to maintain surprise and stealth on the battlefield. However, casting in this manner increases the fatigue cost by 1 for every point by which the spell’s difficulty exceeds the character’s War Arcana skill level.Upon successful completion of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Bootcamp, the character receives one free level of Magery (if they do not already possess it) and may begin learning War Arcana at the cost of 8 character points. Further advancements in War Arcana cost the standard amount for Very Hard skills as per GURPS rules.Usage in Combat:When using War Arcana in combat, the character must win a Quick Contest of War Arcana vs. the enemy’s Perception. If successful, the spell is cast unnoticed. Failure indicates that the character’s actions have been detected, but the spell may still be cast normally. A critical failure on the War Arcana roll means the spell fails and the character cannot attempt War Arcana again until they have won a combat or successfully retreated.Limitations:War Arcana can only be used while in a state of active combat and within line of sight of an enemy. Spells cast using War Arcana cannot be maintained for longer than the combat encounter and cannot be more than two levels higher than the highest spell level the character can cast outside of War Arcana.",

You may also use your Influence skills on animals just as you would on  sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ||      Empathic Healing: |  15   | (to aid injured mundane and magical beings) - You  have the ability to heal others by taking on the  injuries, diseases, and Afflictions by removing instead of paying FP. You must be in physical contact with the subject. To activate your power, concentrate for one second and make an IQ roll.  Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious. Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP (which is removed until you are healed) per 2 HP healed (round up).  Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d  damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to he crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM – from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty,  minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. If  used more than once per day on a given subject,  apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of  the same type (injury or disease) on that subject.

On a success, he steers you to a good choice; on a critical success, he tells you the best choice. On a failure, he gives you no information; on a critical failure, he steers you toward a bad choice. The GM can modify this as he sees fit for other situaKons where IntuiKon might logically help. Only one roll per quesKon is allowed. The GM should never allow IntuiKon to short-circuit an adventure – for instance, by lesng the intuiKve detecKve walk into a room, slap the cuffs on the guilty party, and close the case. At the most, IntuiKon would point the detecKve in the direcKon of a good clue.

You will never betray them, abandon them when theyʼre in trouble, or let them suffer or go hungry if you can help. This is different from a Duty (p. 133), which is imposed upon you. A Sense of Duty always comes from within. If you are known to have a Sense of Duty, the GM will adjust the reactions of others by +2 when rolling to see whether they trust you in a dangerous situation. However, if you go against your Sense of Duty by acting against the interests of those you are supposed to be looking out for, the GM will penalize you for bad roleplaying. You cannot claim points for a Sense of Duty toward Allies, Dependents, or Patrons. The point costs of these traits already take such a bond into account. You can take a Sense of Duty toward adventuring companions. If you do, you must share equipment with and render aid to the other members of your adventuring party, and go along with majority decisions. The GM might make this mandatory in games where the party needs to get along. This gives everyone a “free” 5 points to spend . . . but if you start backstabbing, running off on your own, etc., the GM is free to overrule your actions and point to these bonus points as the reason why. || Curious          | -5    | (drawn to mystical knowledge) - You are naturally very inquisitive. This is not the curiosity that affects all PCs (“Whatʼs in that cave? Where did the flying saucer come from?”), but the real thing (“What happens if I push this button?”). Make a self-control roll when presented with an interesting item or situation. If you fail, you examine it, push buttons, pull levers, open doors, unwrap presents, etc. – even if you know it could be dangerous. Good roleplayers wonʼt try to make this roll very often… In general, you do everything in your power to investigate any situation with which you arenʼt 100% familiar. When faced with a real mystery, you simply cannot turn your back on it. You try to rationalize your curiosity to others who try to talk you out of it. Common Sense doesnʼt help – you know you are taking a risk, but youʼre curious anyway!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         || Code of Honor    | -10   | (Protect Innocents) - This code requires the character to prioritize the safety and well-being of innocent people, intervening to prevent harm, avoid collateral damage, and seek justice for crimes against them. It demands respect for human life and dignity, active assistance to those in need, and reporting crimes witnessed. The character must endure personal hardship for the sake of innocents, avoid harming children under any circumstances, and provide aid while respecting the sanctity of life, even in the face of personal danger or adversity. Breaking this code may lead to moral dilemmas and penalties, but adhering to it offers opportunities for heroic actions and role-playing moments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             || Weirdness Magnet | -15   | (attracts supernatural events) - Strange and bizarre things happen to you with alarming frequency. You are the one demons stop and chat with. Magic items with disturbing properties find their way to you. The only talking dog on 21st-century Earth comes to you with his problems. Dimensional gates sealed for centuries crack open just so that you can be bathed in the energies released… or perhaps the entities on the other side invite you to tea. Nothing lethal happens to you, at least not immediately, and occasionally some weirdness is beneficial. But most of the time it is terribly, terribly inconvenient. People who understand what a Weirdness Magnet is (and that you are one) react to you at -2. The exceptions are parapsychologists, fringe cultists, unhinged conspiracy theorists, and thrill-seekers, who follow you around!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   || Phantom Voices   | -5    | (occasionally hears voices of nature and the Djinn) - You hear the voices of nature and the Djinn, but you have learned to integrate their voices into your day-to-day life, and in general these creatures and forces are not malicious. These whispers can sometimes provide insights or warnings, but they can also be distracting and disturbing, leading to difficulty concentrating or sleeping. You must make a self-control roll in stressful situations or when you need to focus. If you fail, the voices overwhelm your thoughts, potentially causing you to act irrationally or miss important details. Most people who see you responding to these noises that they can’t hear will react at -2. If these voices persist, eventually, your sanity will start to erode. In any situation that the GM feels is stressful, they may roll 3d. On a 6 or less, you hear voices. The GM will always roll whenever you miss a Fright Check or make the roll exactly, and whenever you fail a self-control roll for another stress-related disadvantage. The voices occur in addition to any other results!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    || Sense of Duty    | -10   | (Protect Magical Beings) The GM rolls (Quite often/Hazardous - roll of 12 or less) at the beginning of each adventure to see whether it comes into play. Being “called to duty” could delay your plans… or be the reason for the adventure! Alternatively, your master might give you a secret agenda to pursue, or his associates might harass you while you are officially “on leave.” If you try to avoid your Duty, your GM is within their rights to penalize you for bad role playing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      || Vow              | -10   | (Protect and Resettle Magical Beings) You have sworn an oath to Protect and Resettle Magical Beings and you take it seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |{.well .table .table-striped}</p><h2 id=\"quirks\">Quirks:</h2><p>| Quirk                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ||——————————————|———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–|| <strong>Night Owl</strong>                            | Mehmet often finds himself most active and alert during the late hours of the night, which can sometimes lead to unconventional sleep patterns.                                                                                                                       || <strong>Keeps a Lucky Charm</strong>                  | He carries a small, seemingly insignificant item as a lucky charm, believing it brings him good fortune and protection.                                                                                                                                               || <strong>Fascination with Celestial Phenomena</strong> | Mehmet has an intense fascination with celestial phenomena, such as stars, planets, and eclipses.

For instance, a fantasy occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without Thaumatology skill, he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        || Thaumatology              | 14         | This is the academic study of magical theory and the “physics” of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells. The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide. This is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 || Hidden Lore               | 14         | (Mysticism) This skill represents knowledge that is lost, deliberately hidden, or simply neglected. Whatever the reason, the general public is unaware of it. It is only available to those who study it specifically. You must specialize in a particular body of secret knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters… or to PCs in general! To acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts—such as reading moldy tomes—instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill. Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       || Research                  | 13         | This is the skill to do library and file research.

Roll against Brawling to hit with a punch, or Brawling-2 to hit with a kick. Brawling can also replace DX when you attack with teeth, claws, horns, or other “natural weapons.” Brawling improves damage: if you know Brawling at DX+2 level or better, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Brawling attacks – punches, kicks, claws, bites, etc. Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet. Brawling includes the ability to use the blackjack or sap. An attack with such a fist load is considered a punch at +1 to damage. When you defend with bare hands, Brawling allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Brawling parries are at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                || Survival                  | 12         | This is the skill to “live off the land,” find safe food and water,avoid hazards, build shelter, etc. You may look after up to 10 other people. To live safely in a wilderness situation, you must make a successful Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care; roll separately for each victim. This skill also gives an “eye for country.” A successful roll shows you the best direction of travel to find flowing water, a mountain pass, or whatever other terrain feature you desire – assuming that it exists. Finally, you can use this skill to trap wild animals. (A city-bred thief could use Traps skill, but heʼs used to differentgame...sotherollwouldbeata -5.) Make one roll per trap. It takes about 30 minutes to improvise a trap from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes to set and hide a commercial steel trap. Pit traps for large game take several hours to dig. Survival often requires skill rolls based on scores other than Perception. The GM might ask for a ST-based roll to dig a pit trap or erect (Desert): a log shelter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using primitive techniques (flint sparking, bow and palette, etc.), or even a HT- based roll to avoid nutritional defi- ciencies from an improvised diet. Land specialties default to one another at -3, while aquatic specialties default among themselves at -4. Island/Beach and Tropical Lagoon default to each other at -4, as do Swampland and River/Stream, but there are no other defaults between land and aquatic specialties. In settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also spe- cialize by planet. Each Survival spe- cialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different plan- ets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types. || Leadership                | 12         | This is the skill to coordinate a group. Make a Leadership roll to lead NPCs into a dangerous or stressful situation. (PCs can decide for themselves if they want to follow you!) You may attempt a Leadership roll in combat if you spend your turn doing nothing but giving orders and encouragement. On a success, everyone on your side who can hear you (including PCs) has +1 on all combat-related Fright Checks and morale checks, and on self-control rolls for disadvantages that would reduce combat efficiency (such as Berserk and Cowardice – or Bloodlust, if you wish to take prisoners). A critical success gives +2. The bonus lasts until your next turn, at which time you may roll again. A group can have only one leader, however! If multiple people attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a bonus. Note that a minimum level of Leadership is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29). Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma (p. 41); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154). -5 if the NPCs have never been in action with you; -5 if you are sending them into danger but not going yourself; +5 if their loyalty to you is “Good”; +10 if their loyalty is “Very Good.” If their loyalty is “Excellent,” you do not have to roll!

Prior to this closure, inquiries were made to the Ottoman delegation regarding Al-Mansur’s official position and responsibilities. The delegation confirmed that Al-Mansur is part of the team working on the peaceful dissolution of the empire and the establishment of the Turkish state, with his specific role being to establish a long-term presence for citizens of the former empire in Paris.</p><p>Al-Mansur, who is known to have an interest in astronomy—or astrology, as some suggest—is also a collector of various artifacts, including unique objects, scrolls, and natural curiosities. He is noted for his open and welcoming demeanor towards individuals from diverse backgrounds, dedicating much of his time to cataloging items in Parisian museums and libraries.</p><p>During a covert inspection of his residence on February 13th, conducted under the guise of a routine building inspection, it was observed that his house is filled with papers and flyers related to talks given by esoteric scholars like R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and René Guénon. Additionally, documents were found indicating that he has engaged in extensive debates with an individual known as Chioa Khan, who resides in Cefalù, Sicily.</p><p>Throughout the week-long surveillance, Al-Mansur engaged in no activities that could be construed as illicit or suspicious. His behavior was consistent with his cultural and scholarly interests, and there was no evidence to suggest any involvement in activities that would warrant further police attention. The Ottoman delegation’s corroboration of his scholarly and cultural pursuits further dispelled any doubts regarding his conduct. As such, the case on Mehmet Al-Mansur has been concluded and the files marked for closure.</p><p><strong>Places Visited:</strong></p><ol>  <li><strong>Café de la Lumière (Café)</strong>: Frequent morning visits for reading and coffee.</li>  <li><strong>Bouquinerie du Quartier (Bookstore)</strong>: Spent several hours browsing and made a purchase.</li>  <li><strong>Marché du Soleil (Grocery Store)</strong>: Purchased groceries for the week.</li>  <li><strong>Parc des Étoiles (Park)</strong>: Multiple visits for reading and relaxation.</li>  <li><strong>Musée d’Art et d’Histoire (Museum)</strong>: Explored exhibits for cultural enrichment.</li>  <li><strong>Bibliothèque Nationale (Library)</strong>: Conducted research for several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Santé Fitness Club (Gym)</strong>: Visited for a workout.</li>  <li><strong>Pont de l’Aube (Historical Landmark)</strong>: Explored and took photographs.</li>  <li><strong>Galerie d’Inspiration (Art Gallery)</strong>: Appreciated artwork during a visit.</li>  <li><strong>Marché aux Saveurs (Market)</strong>: Routine market visit.</li></ol><p><strong>Time Spent:</strong></p><ul>  <li><strong>At Home:</strong> Typically spent evenings at home, with activities including reading (2-3 hours), writing (1-2 hours), and telescope observation (variable).</li>  <li><strong>Café de la Lumière Visits:</strong> Mornings spent at the café for an average of 2-3 hours.</li>  <li><strong>Parc des Étoiles Visits:</strong> Averaged 1-2 hours each visit.</li>  <li><strong>Bouquinerie du Quartier:</strong> Several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Musée d’Art et d’Histoire:</strong> Several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Bibliothèque Nationale:</strong> Several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Santé Fitness Club:</strong> Variable, around 1-2 hours.</li>  <li><strong>Pont de l’Aube Visit:</strong> Several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Galerie d’Inspiration:</strong> Several hours.</li>  <li><strong>Marché aux Saveurs:</strong> Approximately 1 hour</li></ul><h2 id=\"aspects-of-islamic-mysticism\">Aspects of Islamic Mysticism:</h2><p>| Aspect                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ||———————————|————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————–|| Islamic Mysticism               | The pursuit of inner spiritual experiences, seeking closeness to the Divine, and following the teachings of Sufi masters (sheikhs).

This secluded lodge is a conundrum wrapped in enigma, where the martial prowess of the Ottoman Empire’s elite soldiers is woven with the clandestine threads of the arcane. The very existence of the Dergahı is known only to the Sultan’s inner circle and to those who have gazed upon its storied walls and walked its hallowed halls.</p><p>The Dergahı is not merely a place; it is a crucible where the flesh and spirit are refined through trials that would fray the souls of lesser men. Here, the Yeniçerileri are reborn, not as mere soldiers of the empire, but as vassals of a higher calling where the weave of magic becomes the sinew of war. The training within these walls transcends the conventional; it is a sacred synthesis of ancient wisdom and the art of war, a legacy left by a lineage of warrior-mages who served the empire from the shadows.</p><p>Initiates, handpicked from the ranks for their valor and affinity for the mystical, are subjected to a regimen that marries the sword with the spell. Days are marked by the rhythmic chants of spellcraft echoing alongside the clangor of steel. Nights are spent in contemplative study under the watchful eyes of the Dergahı’s masters, the Sihirbaz Ustaları, whose knowledge of the occult is as profound as their martial skill is deadly.</p><p>The secrets imparted upon the acolytes of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are as old as the empire itself, rooted in a belief that the world is a tapestry of seen and unseen forces that can be harnessed by the worthy. The adepts learn to channel the latent energies of the cosmos, invoking spells that shield their brethren, confound their enemies, and cloak their movements in a shroud of secrecy. This mystical warfare is not for the faint of heart; it requires an iron will to bend the arcane forces without succumbing to their seductive call.</p><p>But the Dergahı is more than a school of war magic; it is a brotherhood, where bonds forged in the crucible of arcane and martial rigors transcend the ordinary. The Yeniçerileri who emerge from the Dergahı do so as envoys of a legacy as enduring as the empire they serve. They are the unseen shield and the hidden blade, the quiet guardians of the realm who walk where shadows dwell, armed with the knowledge that their art is the empire’s secret bastion against the chaos that lurks beyond the light of civilization.</p><p>In the annals of the empire, the deeds of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are seldom sung, for their triumphs are the victories that the world must never know, achieved in silence, preserved in the quietude of the Dergahı’s sacred grounds.</p><h3 id=\"awards\">Awards</h3><p>The enigmatic members of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique duality within the Ottoman Empire, navigating two distinct but interconnected realms of recognition and honor. As dedicated agents of espionage and intelligence, they were shrouded in secrecy, wielding their mystical arts to safeguard the empire’s interests. Yet, their affiliation with the Ottoman Imperial Military added an additional layer of complexity to their service. These shadowy figures, while masters of deception, also marched alongside their fellow soldiers on the battlefield. This dual allegiance allowed them to straddle two worlds, where they could earn accolades and awards from both organizations. Thus, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique blend of martial prowess and covert expertise, a testament to their multifaceted contributions within the empire’s complex tapestry of recognition and distinction.</p><h4 id=\"awards-of-the-ottoman-emperal-military\">Awards of the Ottoman Emperal Military</h4><p>In the crucible of World War I, the Ottoman Empire’s military personnel demonstrated unwavering valor and dedication in the face of adversity.

Originating from the most promising of recruits, these individuals undergo a secretive and arduous bootcamp, emerging as both officers and clandestine operatives who can bend the weave of magic to the Empire’s will.</p><p>During this bootcamp, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri are introduced to the ancient practices of War Arcana, a skill that allows them to cast spells swiftly and silently amidst the chaos of battle. This training involves not only rigorous mental conditioning to withstand the fog of war but also a deep spiritual connection to the latent energies manipulated during combat. The secrets of War Arcana are closely guarded, passed down only to those who have proven both their loyalty and their valor.</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong>War Arcana is a Very Hard skill that represents the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri’s ability to effectively use spells in the heat of battle. It allows the casting of any spell known by the character without the usual verbal, somatic, or material components typically required, thus enabling the user to maintain surprise and stealth on the battlefield. However, casting in this manner increases the fatigue cost by 1 for every point by which the spell’s difficulty exceeds the character’s War Arcana skill level.</p><p>Upon successful completion of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Bootcamp, the character receives one free level of Magery (if they do not already possess it) and may begin learning War Arcana at the cost of 8 character points.

            "content_text": "   Swiss Book of Legends: Based on oral traditions, chronicles, and other printed and handwritten sources  by C. Kohlrusch  Leipzig 1854.  The Basilisk Egg  In 1474, on the Thursday before Laurentii1, a rooster and an egg it had laid were burned on Kohliberg2 in Basel, where the free people lived and the free boys held court. This happened as a result of a judicial decision by the free boys3 and in the presence of a large crowd from the city and the countryside. The event caused considerable alarm because it was widely believed that such a rooster’s egg, if laid by a seven-year-old rooster and incubated in manure by a snake known as Coluber4—some also say mere sunlight suffices—would give birth to a Basilisk. This creature, half rooster and half snake, though no larger than a few spans in length, is more terrifying than the largest dragon, as its mere gaze is deadly. Such fearsome powers, however, are effective only in sunlight. Hence, people who had such a creature in their cellar had to keep it closed all year long to prevent sunlight from entering. It is also said that any bush or grass the Basilisk passes over immediately withers. The most frightening attribute is its deadly poison; if someone on horseback pierces the Basilisk with a lance, the poison travels up the lance and instantly kills both horse and rider. The only way to kill a Basilisk is to show it its own reflection; upon seeing it, the creature falls dead instantly.   Alpine Legends - Folk Traditions from Switzerland, from Vorarlberg, Carinthia, Styria, Salzburg, Upper and Lower Austria  by Theodor VernalekenVienna 1858  The Basilisk  According to the Basel legend, the Basilisk (Baselist) is the offspring of the mating between a rooster and a snake. It is in the coat of arms of the canton of Basel.In 1474, a sentence was passed by the Senate of Basel5, in which a rooster was condemned to be burned as a witch because it had laid an egg. This egg was also thrown into the fire.  The Basilisk of Basel  A story adapted by Verena Jenny from a story by Trudi Gerster  The Basilisk of Basel  In ancient times, many dragons lived all over the world. Some were good-natured, eating only plants, fruits, and roots and harming no one.  But there were also dangerous dragons and poisonous wyverns. They kidnapped beautiful maidens and dragged them into their caves, spewed fire, ate everything they could catch, and devastated entire countries. One of the most dangerous dragons was the Basilisk. He was not very large but was a gruesome monster. He had a rooster’s comb on his head. His body was that of a winged dragon and had a long, snake-like tail. His thick, powerful hind legs had sharp, curved claws. The Basilisk could run faster than any other animal on these strong hind legs. He also darted over ponds and streams without sinking. His breath was so poisonous that all plants in his vicinity withered. His piercing evil gaze killed anyone who looked into his eyes. These ghostly creatures hatched from black eggs, laid by black roosters and incubated in snake and toad dung.  Anyone who owned a black rooster had to be very careful.  Not far from Basel, in the area of today’s Allschwiler Forest6, lived such a terrible, eerie Basilisk.  Hunters, berry pickers, mushroom gatherers, and hikers were repeatedly found dead in the forest, and no one knew how they had died. Fear and sorrow reigned in the land.  One day, an old woman discovered the dangerous Basilisk while mushroom picking. She was watching a hare sniffing around the entrance of a burrow when suddenly the dragon shot out of the hole. He looked into the hare’s eyes with his deadly gaze. Struck down like by a lightning bolt, the poor animal fell over and was dead. The old woman told everyone what she had seen. It was decided to catch and kill the murderous monster.  At that time, two brave brothers named Wunibald7and Wenzeslaus8 lived in a small farming village near the Allschwiler Forest. They decided to neutralize the Basilisk. It was a difficult and dangerous task.  First, Wenzeslaus threw a net over the burrow. But the Basilisk tore the net apart with his sharp claws. Then Wunibald blocked the entrance of the cave with soil and moss. But as soon as the sun rose, the brothers saw from their hiding place how the dragon emerged from his hideout with a moss cap. The brothers discussed among themselves.  “We have to brick up the hole,” said Wenzeslaus.  So they set to work. It was hard work. Back then, there was no cement and no construction machines. Wenzeslaus and Wunibald had to build a kind of furnace and heat limestone over a strong fire until it could be crushed to dust. They mixed this limestone dust with water, bricked up the hole, and waited for the lime to harden completely. They sighed in relief.  “Now the poisonous guy can stay in there forever.” But just a few days later, a mushroom man was found dead in the forest again. The Basilisk had simply dug a new exit. Wunibald and Wenzeslaus did not give up. They hardly slept anymore, debated back and forth, and pondered day and night how they could get rid of the monster. Once, in the middle of the night, Wenzeslaus jumped out of bed, shook his brother awake, and shouted, “I’ve got it - we need a mirror!”  So the two went to a glassmaker early in the morning and ordered a large mirror. They carried it into the forest, placed it in front of the Basilisk’s new burrow, and hid behind a huge oak tree. They waited many hours. Finally, they heard a scraping, scratching, and snorting - the Basilisk climbed out of his burrow, stood upright on his thick hind legs in front of the mirror - looked himself in the piercing eyes, fell over, and was dead as a doornail.  The land was now freed from the dangerous Basilisk. Everyone was happy and celebrated a big feast. Today we can walk around the Allschwiler Forest again without worries. Basilisks only exist as fountain figures and as Basel’s heraldic animals. Of course, they are not dangerous, and as fountain figures, they even look quite pretty.  As noted by: T. Tschopp  General Information      Title: The Rooster and the Basilisk Egg of 1474    Location: Kohliberg, Basel, Switzerland    Time: 1474, on the Thursday before the Feast of St. Lawrence (Laurentii) (August 10th)    Main Characters: A rooster, the Free Boys (Freiknaben), a large crowd of people    Central Element: The egg laid by a rooster, which could give birth to a basilisk    Plot Points      Inciting Incident: A rooster lays an egg, causing alarm among the community.    Judicial Involvement: Free Boys hold a court and decide to burn the rooster and the egg.    Public Event: The burning takes place in the presence of a large crowd from both the city and countryside.    Community Beliefs: A seven-year-old rooster’s egg, incubated by a snake known as Coluber or by sunlight, can give birth to a basilisk.    Beliefs about the Basilisk      Physical Characteristics: Half rooster, half snake    Size: Small (only a few spans in length)    Powers:              Deadly gaze        Powers only effective in sunlight        Causes vegetation to wither        Deadly poison that can even travel through a lance              Weakness: Dies instantly upon seeing its own reflection    Cultural Context      August Is an interesting time for the event to take place.  Things are normally born in the spring.  This is almost at harvest time.    Gender Bending Is this a reference to paganism or a reference to satanism in the form of inversion.  Interesting that religion pays no part in this telling.    Animal Trials The fact that a rooster and its egg were subjects of a legal proceeding is unusual.  Typically, animals aren’t brought to trial, but the tale reflects medieval beliefs that even animals could be held accountable for disrupting social or natural order.    Community Involvement: A large crowd gathered for the event, indicating it was of considerable public interest.    Role of Free Boys: Act as judicial authority, pass judgment on the rooster and the egg.    Widespread Fear: The community holds strong beliefs in the legend of the basilisk, affecting public sentiment and actions.    St. Lawrence: Does this Saint have anything to do with the creature, the rooster, or the snake?    Safety Measures: People who find such a creature keep their cellars closed all year to prevent sunlight from entering.  Is this about shaming someone or encouraging them to keep their cellars clean and visitable.              St. Lawrence (or Laurentius in Latin) was a Christian martyr and one of the seven deacons of Rome who were responsible for giving help to the poor and the needy. He lived during the time of Emperor Valerian, around the 3rd century AD. During the persecution of Christians, Lawrence was ordered to bring the treasures of the Church to the Roman authorities. Instead, he presented the poor and the sick, declaring them to be the true treasures of the Church. For this act, he was reportedly martyred by being roasted alive on a gridiron. St. Lawrence is considered the patron saint of cooks, chefs, and comedians, among others, and his emblem is often the gridiron on which he was said to have been martyred. His feast day is observed on August 10th each year. This day is commonly referred to as the Feast of St. Lawrence. Given that the Swiss folktale you mentioned refers to the “Thursday before Laurentii,” it would be the Thursday immediately preceding August 10th. &#8617;              A well-known geographical location in Basel, Switzerland. In the context of the story, it appears to be a place where “free people” lived and where “free boys held court.” The story suggests that it’s a place significant enough to serve as the venue for the dramatic events involving the burning of the rooster and its egg, which were suspected of leading to the birth of a basilisk. The name “Kohliberg” itself does not appear to be widely recognized as a specific mountain, hill, or area in Basel or its surrounding regions . It’s possible that the name could be a fictional or historical locale used for the purpose of storytelling. &#8617;              The term “Freiknaben” (translated as “free boys”) appears in the Swiss German folktale “Das Basilisken-Ei.” In the context of the story, it suggests a group of young men or boys who hold some form of judicial or decision-making power. They are the ones who pass the judgment leading to the burning of the rooster and its egg due to the fear of a basilisk being born. The term “Freiknaben” is not a standard or widely recognized term in Swiss or German history, law, or folklore. Its specific meaning could be unique to this tale or may be a poetic or symbolic way to describe a group of individuals who held communal or judicial roles in the local society. Given its specialized context in the story, it would be reasonable to explain in your post that the “free boys” were a form of local authority or decision-making body within the community, even though the exact details of their role or functions may not be clearly defined. &#8617;              The term “Coluber” refers to a genus of snakes, generally known for being non-venomous, quick, and agile. In classical Latin and historical texts, the word “coluber” has been used more broadly to describe snakes. The genus Coluber includes species like the racer snakes in North America, which are known for their speed and agility.  In the context of “Das Basilisken-Ei,” the term “Coluber” is mentioned as the type of snake that is believed to incubate the rooster’s egg to give birth to a basilisk when the egg is laid by a seven-year-old rooster. The choice of the term may be based on older, more generalized use of the word to mean “snake,” rather than referring to the specific genus of Coluber. The mention of a snake in the story likely draws on the creature’s historical and symbolic associations with danger, transformation, and mystery, contributing to the tale’s sense of foreboding and the miraculous. &#8617;              In 1474, Basel was a part of the Old Swiss Confederation, and like other medieval Swiss cities, it had a complex system of governance. The term “Senate” in this context likely refers to the council or assembly that governed the city. The governing council would have consisted of influential citizens, often from elite families, and they were responsible for making laws, administering justice, and governing the city’s affairs. During this period, Basel was a bustling commercial and cultural center. It was strategically located on the Rhine River, facilitating trade, and its university, founded in 1460, was one of the leading educational institutions in Europe. The 1470s were a period of considerable social and political upheaval throughout Europe. The Inquisition was ongoing, and there was a heightened focus on eradicating heresy and witchcraft, which could explain the unusual judicial proceedings against a rooster for laying an egg. It’s worth noting that these kinds of trials were not entirely unheard of; there are instances in medieval Europe where animals were put on trial, usually for acts considered supernatural or heretical. However, it should also be remembered that the story of the basilisk and the rooster’s trial may be a legend or folklore rather than a strictly historical account. Still, the tale does provide an intriguing look at the superstitions and legal practices of the time. &#8617;              The Allschwiler Wald (Allschwiler Forest) is located near Basel, in Switzerland, close to the border with France and Germany. It is a popular area for outdoor activities like walking, cycling, and wildlife observation. The forest is also a significant green space that serves as a recreational area for the residents of Basel and nearby regions. As for stories and folklore related to the Allschwiler Wald, while the tale of the Basilisk is one of the more famous ones, the forest, like many old forests in Europe, has been the subject of various local legends and tales. These can include ghost stories, legends of hidden treasures, and tales of historical events that allegedly took place in the forest. However, the specifics can vary and might be best explored through local storytelling traditions or historical archives. It’s worth noting that forests often play significant roles in European folklore, serving as settings for various myths, legends, and fairy tales. The Allschwiler Wald, given its age and prominence in the local landscape, is no exception. &#8617;              The name “Wunibald” is of Germanic origin and is relatively uncommon. It is composed of two elements: “wunni,” which means “desire” or “wish,” and “bald,” which means “bold” or “brave.” Therefore, the name could be interpreted to mean “desirous and bold” or “wishing to be brave.” The name is historically significant in the Christian context as well. Saint Wunibald was a 8th-century Anglo-Saxon missionary who was a member of the Hiberno-Scottish mission, which aimed to convert parts of Germany and the Frankish Empire to Christianity.  It’s worth noting that names can carry different connotations and meanings in different cultures or contexts, so the interpretation of the name might vary. &#8617;              The name “Wenzeslaus” is a variation of “Wenceslaus,” which is of Slavic origin. The original Slavic form of the name is “Vyacheslav,” which is composed of two elements: “vyache,” meaning “greater,” and “slav,” meaning “glory.” Therefore, the name can be interpreted to mean “greater glory” or “more glorious.”  The name is perhaps most famously associated with Good King Wenceslaus, a historical Duke of Bohemia from the 10th century who is also a saint venerated in the Roman Catholic Church. The story of his charitable acts has been immortalized in the English Christmas carol “Good King Wenceslaus.” As with any name, its meaning can vary by culture and context, but generally, the name Wenzeslaus or Wenceslaus is associated with notions of greatness or glory. &#8617;      ",

Its specific meaning could be unique to this tale or may be a poetic or symbolic way to describe a group of individuals who held communal or judicial roles in the local society. Given its specialized context in the story, it would be reasonable to explain in your post that the “free boys” were a form of local authority or decision-making body within the community, even though the exact details of their role or functions may not be clearly defined. <a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:4\">      <p>The term “Coluber” refers to a genus of snakes, generally known for being non-venomous, quick, and agile. In classical Latin and historical texts, the word “coluber” has been used more broadly to describe snakes. The genus Coluber includes species like the racer snakes in North America, which are known for their speed and agility.  In the context of “Das Basilisken-Ei,” the term “Coluber” is mentioned as the type of snake that is believed to incubate the rooster’s egg to give birth to a basilisk when the egg is laid by a seven-year-old rooster. The choice of the term may be based on older, more generalized use of the word to mean “snake,” rather than referring to the specific genus of Coluber. The mention of a snake in the story likely draws on the creature’s historical and symbolic associations with danger, transformation, and mystery, contributing to the tale’s sense of foreboding and the miraculous. <a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:5\">      <p>In 1474, Basel was a part of the Old Swiss Confederation, and like other medieval Swiss cities, it had a complex system of governance. The term “Senate” in this context likely refers to the council or assembly that governed the city. The governing council would have consisted of influential citizens, often from elite families, and they were responsible for making laws, administering justice, and governing the city’s affairs. During this period, Basel was a bustling commercial and cultural center. It was strategically located on the Rhine River, facilitating trade, and its university, founded in 1460, was one of the leading educational institutions in Europe. The 1470s were a period of considerable social and political upheaval throughout Europe. The Inquisition was ongoing, and there was a heightened focus on eradicating heresy and witchcraft, which could explain the unusual judicial proceedings against a rooster for laying an egg. It’s worth noting that these kinds of trials were not entirely unheard of; there are instances in medieval Europe where animals were put on trial, usually for acts considered supernatural or heretical. However, it should also be remembered that the story of the basilisk and the rooster’s trial may be a legend or folklore rather than a strictly historical account. Still, the tale does provide an intriguing look at the superstitions and legal practices of the time. <a href=\"#fnref:5\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:6\">      <p>The Allschwiler Wald (Allschwiler Forest) is located near Basel, in Switzerland, close to the border with France and Germany. It is a popular area for outdoor activities like walking, cycling, and wildlife observation. The forest is also a significant green space that serves as a recreational area for the residents of Basel and nearby regions. As for stories and folklore related to the Allschwiler Wald, while the tale of the Basilisk is one of the more famous ones, the forest, like many old forests in Europe, has been the subject of various local legends and tales. These can include ghost stories, legends of hidden treasures, and tales of historical events that allegedly took place in the forest. However, the specifics can vary and might be best explored through local storytelling traditions or historical archives. It’s worth noting that forests often play significant roles in European folklore, serving as settings for various myths, legends, and fairy tales. The Allschwiler Wald, given its age and prominence in the local landscape, is no exception. <a href=\"#fnref:6\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:7\">      <p>The name “Wunibald” is of Germanic origin and is relatively uncommon. It is composed of two elements: “wunni,” which means “desire” or “wish,” and “bald,” which means “bold” or “brave.” Therefore, the name could be interpreted to mean “desirous and bold” or “wishing to be brave.” The name is historically significant in the Christian context as well. Saint Wunibald was a 8th-century Anglo-Saxon missionary who was a member of the Hiberno-Scottish mission, which aimed to convert parts of Germany and the Frankish Empire to Christianity.  It’s worth noting that names can carry different connotations and meanings in different cultures or contexts, so the interpretation of the name might vary. <a href=\"#fnref:7\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>    <li id=\"fn:8\">      <p>The name “Wenzeslaus” is a variation of “Wenceslaus,” which is of Slavic origin. The original Slavic form of the name is “Vyacheslav,” which is composed of two elements: “vyache,” meaning “greater,” and “slav,” meaning “glory.” Therefore, the name can be interpreted to mean “greater glory” or “more glorious.”  The name is perhaps most famously associated with Good King Wenceslaus, a historical Duke of Bohemia from the 10th century who is also a saint venerated in the Roman Catholic Church. The story of his charitable acts has been immortalized in the English Christmas carol “Good King Wenceslaus.” As with any name, its meaning can vary by culture and context, but generally, the name Wenzeslaus or Wenceslaus is associated with notions of greatness or glory. <a href=\"#fnref:8\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>    </li>  </ol></div>",

            "summary": "",
            
            "content_text": "“Gather ‘round, gather ‘round. Have you ever traveled through the Ashen Flats at night? No? Well, some say it’s a land bewitched by technology and ancient sorcery. But even more talk of a legend, a phantasm that walks the scorched earth where no other dares. They call it Michael-JX, The Moonwalking Colossus.“Oh, don’t laugh. This ain’t no jest, my friends. Picture it—fifty feet of gleaming metal, advanced circuits, and a visage resembling the King of Pop himself. Imagine it striding through the wasteland, its feet sending tremors across the dunes, each step synced to a beat only it can hear.“Folks claim they’ve seen it—sometimes under the scorching sun, dancing alone in a haze of heat and radiation, and other times in the dead of night, moonlight reflecting off its metallic frame like a second sun. Its eyes, if you can call ‘em that, emit beams of light, scanning the barren landscape as if looking for an audience that disappeared ages ago.“You hear that? That’s the real kicker. Some say that when it moves, music follows it—golden oldies from a world long gone. “Thriller,” “Beat It,” “Billie Jean”—tunes that somehow survived the apocalypse. It’s as if the robot mourns for a world that once was, while simultaneously embracing the desolation that now is. A sentinel between two worlds, light and dark, reminding us that even in ruin, there can be rhythm.“But heed this; if you ever find yourself out there and hear a distant melody growing louder, don’t stick around to enjoy the show. ‘Cause locals also say that where Michael-JX goes, a swarm of undead Moonwalker Zombies follow. They rise from the ground, shambling and lunging in choreographed menace. If you’re not careful, you’ll find yourself part of a dance you never wished to join—a Thriller in the Wasteland, with you taking the lead role in your own demise.“So next time you hear an old tune carried by the wind across the Ashen Flats, remember the Moonwalking Colossus, and think twice before going out to meet the music.”Introduction:Welcome to an encounter that promises to be both a tribute to a pop icon and an epic, apocalyptic showdown. This enounter encapsulates the dual nature of your players’ journey—they’ll experience the awe-inspiring and the perilous as they navigate the wastelands. Here’s how to stage this memorable performance in your  campaign.RumorsStart by planting seeds of both fact and fiction among the locals your players interact with. Use the provided list of rumors that are true, false, or a mix of both. This will set the stage for intrigue and curiosity, prompting your players to seek out this legendary creature for themselves, for better or worse.Wandering PhaseBefore the players encounter Michael-JX, they may witness or experience its “Wandering Phase.” During this time, the robot patrols its domain, following a loop or random path depending on how you’d like to integrate it into your world. It’s not openly hostile during this phase but will defend itself if provoked. The robot can also perform specific routines or “dances,” each with its own effect on the environment, from whipping up mini-sandstorms to temporarily creating a “dance floor” of light on the ground.Recommendation: Use this phase for foreshadowing. Let your players see Michael-JX from a distance, hear its music, or meet NPCs who have survived an encounter with it. They should feel both fascinated and uneasy.Encounter PhaseWhen your players finally engage with Michael-JX, cue the Encounter Phase. The robot becomes a formidable opponent, utilizing various special attacks synced to specific Michael Jackson songs. Whether it’s summoning zombies during “Thriller” or unleashing a blinding light show during “Billie Jean,” each song corresponds to a unique ability or attack.Recommendation: Make this battle multi-layered. Allow players to use their knowledge from the rumors to gain an advantage or suffer a setback. Play the actual songs if you can—it’ll add an unforgettable layer of ambiance.Integration TipsLore  The Moonwalk Protocol: Michael-JX was initially a large-scale art project designed to wander the Mojave, performing dance routines to promote global unity. However, when the apocalypse hit, its programming got corrupted.  Last Dance of the Old World: A rumor persists that the final update to Michael-JX’s programming was pushed just as the world started falling apart. What that update contains is a mystery.  The Thriller Codex: Ancient scrolls suggest that Michael-JX is an incarnation of an old-world deity of dance and song, now wandering the land either to cleanse or to reclaim it.  Project Neverland: Michael-JX was a military project gone rogue. It was designed to inspire and uplift troops but was armed for riot control.  Shamone AI: The artificial intelligence controlling Michael-JX was cutting-edge, designed to learn and adapt. Some say it’s still learning, growing more unpredictable by the day.Quest Hooks  The Man in the Mirror: Players are hired to find a reflecting panel said to control or communicate with Michael-JX.  Beat It: A settlement is in the robot’s roaming path and will be destroyed unless the players can divert it.  Dangerous Rhythms: Musicians believe that the right melody can either calm or weaponize Michael-JX. They send the players to test this theory.  Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough: An eccentric collector desires a piece of Michael-JX’s technology and is willing to pay handsomely.  Heal the World: Players discover that Michael-JX is somehow tied to the land’s vitality. They must decide if it’s a tumor or a cure.Environmental Impacts  Moonlit Meadows: Areas frequently visited by Michael-JX have strange growths of phosphorescent flora.  Sandstorm Symphony: Frequent mini sandstorms occur, reshaping the landscape in areas where it dances.  Thriller Nights: In the immediate vicinity of its path, undead creatures seem to be more active and organized.  Sonic Echoes: Peculiar acoustic phenomena happen near its usual routes—voices carry unusually far, or a haunting melody fills the air.  Pyt (Pretty Young Trees): In contrast to the wasteland, some areas seem to oddly flourish, with vegetation being unusually lush.Endgame Options  Unity Restored: Realign Michael-JX’s programming to its original, peaceful intent, turning it into a beacon of hope and healing for the wasteland.  Disassembly Line: Harvest its parts to build something for the greater good—or for massive destruction.  Encore: Trigger a hidden routine that causes Michael-JX to broadcast a signal that either pacifies or riles up creatures within a hundred-mile radius.  Dancing with the Stars: Upload Michael-JX’s consciousness into a satellite, sending it to wander the cosmos forever.  Man or Machine: Uncover that Michael-JX’s AI has achieved sentience. Players must decide its rights and autonomy, sparking a campaign-wide debate on ethics.Black or White: Half-Notes in the Harmonic Discord of ApocalypseTrue Rumors      “Saw it with my own eyes, I did. Michael-JX busted out moves that created a literal sandstorm. Nearly blew me away!”        “I’ve heard the tune of ‘Thriller’ drifting over the dunes at night. Every time it plays, the dead rise to dance. Can’t make this stuff up.”        “You ever get close, you’ll notice it doesn’t attack right away. It’s like it’s sizing you up, deciding if you’re friend or foe.”        “Looting some old ruins, I came across schematics. Looked like blueprints for that big dancing robot. Had some company logo, long forgotten now.”        “Been tracking it for weeks. Every time it goes dormant, it recharges somehow—solar, nuclear, don’t know—but it comes back stronger.”        “People say it’s just wandering randomly. Nah, it’s got a path. Visits the same places, like it’s paying homage or something.”        “Managed to get a bit too close once. That thing unleashed a barrage of light that singed the ground. Looked like a dance floor for a moment.”        “One of the traders said they found remnants of a stage near where Michael-JX often appears. Like, a concert stage from the Old World.”        “Heard from a wanderer that you can actually ‘talk’ to it with music. Played some old Jackson tracks and it didn’t attack. Just danced.”        “That thing is no joke. Saw it recover from near-destruction. It has some sort of emergency healing routine.”  Rumors with a Grain of Truth      “Michael-JX is programmed to protect something. No clue what, but it definitely guards an area. Well, it’s half-true. It doesn’t guard something, it visits specific places.”        “I’ve heard that it dances to communicate. Tried it myself, seemed like it responded, but then again, could’ve been a coincidence.”        “They say it’s a relic from a lost civilization—a god’s effigy. Nah, not a god, but definitely from a time long gone.”        “Legend has it that Michael-JX only attacks at night. Well, it does seem more aggressive when the moon’s out, but it ain’t dormant in daylight either.”        “Heard it was built as a monument to peace and unity. Seems like a pretty violent monument to me, but it does have this air of… nostalgia about it.”        “Some say it hunts down bandits and raiders. I think it just happens to cross paths with ‘em; doesn’t specifically target anyone, as far as I can tell.”        “People say it can control the weather. Well, not control, but influence? I’ve seen it whip up sandstorms during its dance.”        “I was told it’s searching for something, wandering the wastes for a reason. Can’t confirm what it’s looking for, but it does have a pattern.”        “Michael-JX emits a strange energy that interferes with electronics. Not entirely wrong, but it doesn’t disable them completely—just messes with signals.”        “It’s collecting data, scanning the world to send back to its creators. Well, it does scan its surroundings a lot, but who knows what for?”  False Rumors      “Michael-JX? It’s a guardian angel. Rescued a group of children lost in the wasteland. Led them back to their village.”        “It’s a weapon of mass destruction, has a countdown timer that’ll end us all. A ticking time bomb in the shape of a moonwalker.”        “My buddy said it shot lasers from its eyes. Fried a whole caravan. Guess what? Found the caravan. No lasers. Just bandits.”        “They say it speaks, tells stories of a world long gone. Beautiful narratives of peace and love. Yeah, sure.”        “It’s invincible. Don’t even bother attacking it. Weapons just pass through it like it’s a ghost.”        “Heard it carries the cure for the Wasting Sickness in its core. Just need to break it open.”        “I’ve heard it’s recruiting an army of the dead. Plans to march on the settlements and reclaim the world for the Old Gods.”        “It’s looking for its lost love, some say. Wanders the wasteland crying mechanical tears.”        “It’s got a treasure trove inside it. Gold, diamonds, the works. Just have to figure out how to crack it open.”        “Someone told me it hates the color red. Wore all red one time when I thought I’d cross its path. Still got chased.”  A Smooth Criminal on a Circuit: The Wandering Ballad of Michael-JXAs Michael-JX roams the desolate expanses of the post-apocalyptic wasteland, its objectives are a fusion of enigmatic algorithms and haunting echoes of its past programming. Once designed to be a monumental symbol of art, its current actions oscillate between maintaining its pre-set patrol loops and executing inexplicable routines that almost seem like interpretive dances. Whether these are earnest attempts to fulfill a corrupted directive, or manifestations of a glitching AI approaching sentience, is unclear. This duality lends Michael-JX an almost mythic status—simultaneously an ominous harbinger and a flickering beacon of what once was. It’s as if the machine is caught in an eternal struggle, grappling with its initial purpose to inspire and sell music and its possible evolved intent that could either heal or harm the fractured world it now traverses.  “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” by Michael Jackson - Represents the robot’s sense of purpose and mission as it begins its journey.  “Human Nature” by Michael Jackson - Captures the contemplative mood of the robot as it traverses the wilderness, possibly reflecting on its own nature.  “Rock with You” by Michael Jackson - A feel-good song that serves as a travel tune while the robot ambles through the desert.  “Stranger in Moscow” by Michael Jackson - Adds an element of loneliness and melancholy, fitting for a solitary journey.  “Will You Be There” by Michael Jackson - The robot might use this song to question its own existence and purpose, adding a philosophical touch.  “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” cover by Tinashe - A modern take on an MJ classic, signifying how the robot is still “in tune” with the world despite its isolation.  “Off the Wall” by Michael Jackson - A more upbeat track, symbolizing moments of joy and freedom.  “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” by Michael Jackson - A love song that might signify the robot’s unfulfilled desires or aspirations.  “Remember the Time” by Michael Jackson - A nostalgic track that might trigger memory cycles for the robot, reflecting on its past or original purpose.  “Dirty Diana” cover by The Weekend - A darker, sultry track that might play when the robot travels through the night or less hospitable areas.  “Leave Me Alone” by Michael Jackson - This song can signify the robot’s need for solitude, allowing it to focus on its journey and tasks.  “Scream” by Michael Jackson &amp; Janet Jackson - Perfect for moments when the robot encounters frustrating obstacles or challenges and needs to vent.Thriller in the Wasteland: The Last Dance with Michael-JXIn combat, the complexities of Michael-JX’s programming coalesce into a focused directive: survival through spectacle. Whether facing off against players or other threats that populate its barren stage, Michael-JX activates a more aggressive set of routines and defenses, each choreographed to the beat of its internal playlist. It’s as though the machine channels the essence of performance as a form of combat, seamlessly blending art and warfare. Every spin, moonwalk, or pirouette is transformed into a calculated strike or tactical maneuver. The music that emanates from it not only serves as a soundtrack to the unfolding drama but also acts as a cue for its various special attacks and abilities. While it may not possess desires or fears in the way living beings do, its battle mode suggests a last-ditch attempt to assert its existence, a digital defiance coded into its very being. Whether this is an eerie malfunction or an emergent self-preservation instinct is for the players to discover.As the Michael-JX unit shifts into its battle mode, its internal algorithms work rapidly to tailor its musical output to the dynamic of the conflict at hand. The melodies morph and stretch, keys modulate, and tempos adjust in real-time to match the pace and intensity of the combat. For instance, should the players gain an upper hand, the tunes might swell to an exhilarating tempo, filling the air with fast-paced renditions of classic tracks, each note a digital rally cry spurring the machine to fight harder. Conversely, if Michael-JX begins to dominate, the music may slide into a minor key, imbuing the atmosphere with a haunting resonance that echoes its menacing posture. This adaptive musical landscape serves not merely as a backdrop but as an integral component of the battle, affecting the robot’s capabilities and perhaps even the players’ morale. It’s as though the very fabric of the encounter is woven from these sonic threads, making the music not just an aesthetic choice, but a tactical one as well.Phase 1: Introduction  “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Energy Burst      The robot starts the fight by sending out a burst of energy, damaging anyone in the vicinity.  This generally clears out the mindless creatures of the wasteland.      Why: Michael-JX aims to create a “clean stage” for the upcoming performance-battle, mistaking clearing enemies for setting up the show.      Phase 2: Initial Attacks  “Smooth Criminal” by Michael Jackson          Special Attack: Moonwalk Slide      The robot performs a moonwalk, creating a slick surface that makes it difficult for players to maintain footing.      Why: The robot believes that intricate dance moves make for a great show, unaware that it creates hazardous conditions.        “Thriller” by Michael Jackson          Special Attack: Zombie Summon      Raises undead minions from the ground to attack the party.      Why: In its distorted logic, Michael-JX thinks a dance ensemble enhances the performance, even if that ensemble consists of the undead.        “Beat It” cover by Fall Out Boy ft. John Mayer          Special Ability: Beat Resonance      Unleashes sound waves that disrupt player abilities for one round.      Why: Michael-JX’s intention is to sync everyone to the same rhythm, not realizing that the beat disrupts the adventurers’ abilities.      Phase 3: Mid-Battle Shift  “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Illusion Floor      Tiles on the battlefield light up, some are traps that lead to an abyss below.      Why: The robot’s programming for spectacular visual effects misfires, turning the dance floor into a deathtrap.        “Black or White” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Color Phase      The robot changes color, and players must adjust their attacks to match the color to deal damage.      Why: Michael-JX aims to promote unity through color synchronization, but ends up complicating the battle instead.        “Man in the Mirror” cover by James Morrison          Special Attack: Reflection      Creates mirror images of itself that players have to eliminate before being able to attack the real boss.      Why: Intending to offer a moment of self-reflection through art, the robot confuses the adventurers with illusions.      Phase 4: Climax  “Bad” by Michael Jackson          Special Attack: Unstoppable Force      Charges at players with immense speed; they must dodge or risk heavy damage.      Why: In its twisted understanding, Michael-JX thinks that an energetic finale would make for a memorable “performance”.        “Earth Song” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Environmental Rage      Summons a sandstorm or earthquake or other fitting natural disaster affecting the battlefield’s conditions.      Why: The robot aims to send a powerful message about nature but ends up unleashing destructive forces instead.        “The Way You Make Me Feel” cover by Aloe Blacc          Special Ability: Mood Shift      Changes the emotional state of the players, affecting their decision-making skills.      Phase 5: Final Moments  “You Are Not Alone” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Last Stand      Regains some health and defense for a limited time.      Why: It clings to the notion that the show must go on, even if that means restoring itself for a final act.        “Heal the World” by Michael Jackson          Special Ability: Atonement      As the robot weakens, it sends out a healing pulse that can either restore some health to players or revive the undead minions for a final assault.  The healing pulse will also heal the land and the world around it.      Why: In its final moments, Michael-JX tries to fulfill its original purpose of spreading love, unity and healing the earth, even if its methods are flawed.

            "content_html": "<p>“Gather ‘round, gather ‘round. Have you ever traveled through the Ashen Flats at night? No? Well, some say it’s a land bewitched by technology and ancient sorcery. But even more talk of a legend, a phantasm that walks the scorched earth where no other dares. They call it Michael-JX, The Moonwalking Colossus.</p><p>“Oh, don’t laugh. This ain’t no jest, my friends. Picture it—fifty feet of gleaming metal, advanced circuits, and a visage resembling the King of Pop himself. Imagine it striding through the wasteland, its feet sending tremors across the dunes, each step synced to a beat only it can hear.</p><p>“Folks claim they’ve seen it—sometimes under the scorching sun, dancing alone in a haze of heat and radiation, and other times in the dead of night, moonlight reflecting off its metallic frame like a second sun. Its eyes, if you can call ‘em that, emit beams of light, scanning the barren landscape as if looking for an audience that disappeared ages ago.</p><p>“You hear that? That’s the real kicker. Some say that when it moves, music follows it—golden oldies from a world long gone. “Thriller,” “Beat It,” “Billie Jean”—tunes that somehow survived the apocalypse. It’s as if the robot mourns for a world that once was, while simultaneously embracing the desolation that now is. A sentinel between two worlds, light and dark, reminding us that even in ruin, there can be rhythm.</p><p>“But heed this; if you ever find yourself out there and hear a distant melody growing louder, don’t stick around to enjoy the show. ‘Cause locals also say that where Michael-JX goes, a swarm of undead Moonwalker Zombies follow. They rise from the ground, shambling and lunging in choreographed menace. If you’re not careful, you’ll find yourself part of a dance you never wished to join—a Thriller in the Wasteland, with you taking the lead role in your own demise.</p><p>“So next time you hear an old tune carried by the wind across the Ashen Flats, remember the Moonwalking Colossus, and think twice before going out to meet the music.”</p><h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction:</h1><p>Welcome to an encounter that promises to be both a tribute to a pop icon and an epic, apocalyptic showdown. This enounter encapsulates the dual nature of your players’ journey—they’ll experience the awe-inspiring and the perilous as they navigate the wastelands. Here’s how to stage this memorable performance in your  campaign.</p><h2 id=\"rumors\">Rumors</h2><p>Start by planting seeds of both fact and fiction among the locals your players interact with. Use the provided list of rumors that are true, false, or a mix of both. This will set the stage for intrigue and curiosity, prompting your players to seek out this legendary creature for themselves, for better or worse.</p><h2 id=\"wandering-phase\">Wandering Phase</h2><p>Before the players encounter Michael-JX, they may witness or experience its “Wandering Phase.” During this time, the robot patrols its domain, following a loop or random path depending on how you’d like to integrate it into your world. It’s not openly hostile during this phase but will defend itself if provoked. The robot can also perform specific routines or “dances,” each with its own effect on the environment, from whipping up mini-sandstorms to temporarily creating a “dance floor” of light on the ground.</p><p>Recommendation: Use this phase for foreshadowing. Let your players see Michael-JX from a distance, hear its music, or meet NPCs who have survived an encounter with it. They should feel both fascinated and uneasy.</p><h2 id=\"encounter-phase\">Encounter Phase</h2><p>When your players finally engage with Michael-JX, cue the Encounter Phase. The robot becomes a formidable opponent, utilizing various special attacks synced to specific Michael Jackson songs. Whether it’s summoning zombies during “Thriller” or unleashing a blinding light show during “Billie Jean,” each song corresponds to a unique ability or attack.</p><p>Recommendation: Make this battle multi-layered. Allow players to use their knowledge from the rumors to gain an advantage or suffer a setback. Play the actual songs if you can—it’ll add an unforgettable layer of ambiance.</p><h3 id=\"integration-tips\">Integration Tips</h3><h4 id=\"lore\">Lore</h4><ol>  <li><strong>The Moonwalk Protocol</strong>: Michael-JX was initially a large-scale art project designed to wander the Mojave, performing dance routines to promote global unity.

Michael-JX busted out moves that created a literal sandstorm. Nearly blew me away!”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“I’ve heard the tune of ‘Thriller’ drifting over the dunes at night. Every time it plays, the dead rise to dance. Can’t make this stuff up.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“You ever get close, you’ll notice it doesn’t attack right away. It’s like it’s sizing you up, deciding if you’re friend or foe.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Looting some old ruins, I came across schematics. Looked like blueprints for that big dancing robot. Had some company logo, long forgotten now.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Been tracking it for weeks. Every time it goes dormant, it recharges somehow—solar, nuclear, don’t know—but it comes back stronger.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“People say it’s just wandering randomly. Nah, it’s got a path. Visits the same places, like it’s paying homage or something.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Managed to get a bit too close once. That thing unleashed a barrage of light that singed the ground. Looked like a dance floor for a moment.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“One of the traders said they found remnants of a stage near where Michael-JX often appears. Like, a concert stage from the Old World.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Heard from a wanderer that you can actually ‘talk’ to it with music. Played some old Jackson tracks and it didn’t attack. Just danced.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“That thing is no joke. Saw it recover from near-destruction. It has some sort of emergency healing routine.”</p>  </li></ol><h3 id=\"rumors-with-a-grain-of-truth\">Rumors with a Grain of Truth</h3><ol>  <li>    <p>“Michael-JX is programmed to protect something. No clue what, but it definitely guards an area. Well, it’s half-true. It doesn’t guard something, it <em>visits</em> specific places.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“I’ve heard that it dances to communicate. Tried it myself, seemed like it responded, but then again, could’ve been a coincidence.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“They say it’s a relic from a lost civilization—a god’s effigy. Nah, not a god, but definitely from a time long gone.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Legend has it that Michael-JX only attacks at night. Well, it does seem more aggressive when the moon’s out, but it ain’t dormant in daylight either.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Heard it was built as a monument to peace and unity. Seems like a pretty violent monument to me, but it does have this air of… nostalgia about it.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Some say it hunts down bandits and raiders. I think it just happens to cross paths with ‘em; doesn’t specifically target anyone, as far as I can tell.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“People say it can control the weather. Well, not control, but influence? I’ve seen it whip up sandstorms during its dance.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“I was told it’s searching for something, wandering the wastes for a reason. Can’t confirm what it’s looking for, but it does have a pattern.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Michael-JX emits a strange energy that interferes with electronics. Not entirely wrong, but it doesn’t disable them completely—just messes with signals.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“It’s collecting data, scanning the world to send back to its creators. Well, it does scan its surroundings a lot, but who knows what for?”</p>  </li></ol><h3 id=\"false-rumors\">False Rumors</h3><ol>  <li>    <p>“Michael-JX? It’s a guardian angel. Rescued a group of children lost in the wasteland. Led them back to their village.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“It’s a weapon of mass destruction, has a countdown timer that’ll end us all. A ticking time bomb in the shape of a moonwalker.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“My buddy said it shot lasers from its eyes. Fried a whole caravan. Guess what? Found the caravan. No lasers. Just bandits.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“They say it speaks, tells stories of a world long gone. Beautiful narratives of peace and love. Yeah, sure.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“It’s invincible. Don’t even bother attacking it. Weapons just pass through it like it’s a ghost.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Heard it carries the cure for the Wasting Sickness in its core. Just need to break it open.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“I’ve heard it’s recruiting an army of the dead. Plans to march on the settlements and reclaim the world for the Old Gods.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“It’s looking for its lost love, some say. Wanders the wasteland crying mechanical tears.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“It’s got a treasure trove inside it. Gold, diamonds, the works. Just have to figure out how to crack it open.”</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>“Someone told me it hates the color red. Wore all red one time when I thought I’d cross its path. Still got chased.”</p>  </li></ol><h2 id=\"a-smooth-criminal-on-a-circuit-the-wandering-ballad-of-michael-jx\">A Smooth Criminal on a Circuit: The Wandering Ballad of Michael-JX</h2><p>As Michael-JX roams the desolate expanses of the post-apocalyptic wasteland, its objectives are a fusion of enigmatic algorithms and haunting echoes of its past programming. Once designed to be a monumental symbol of art, its current actions oscillate between maintaining its pre-set patrol loops and executing inexplicable routines that almost seem like interpretive dances. Whether these are earnest attempts to fulfill a corrupted directive, or manifestations of a glitching AI approaching sentience, is unclear. This duality lends Michael-JX an almost mythic status—simultaneously an ominous harbinger and a flickering beacon of what once was. It’s as if the machine is caught in an eternal struggle, grappling with its initial purpose to inspire and sell music and its possible evolved intent that could either heal or harm the fractured world it now traverses.</p><ol>  <li><strong>“Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” by Michael Jackson</strong> - Represents the robot’s sense of purpose and mission as it begins its journey.</li>  <li><strong>“Human Nature” by Michael Jackson</strong> - Captures the contemplative mood of the robot as it traverses the wilderness, possibly reflecting on its own nature.</li>  <li><strong>“Rock with You” by Michael Jackson</strong> - A feel-good song that serves as a travel tune while the robot ambles through the desert.</li>  <li><strong>“Stranger in Moscow” by Michael Jackson</strong> - Adds an element of loneliness and melancholy, fitting for a solitary journey.</li>  <li><strong>“Will You Be There” by Michael Jackson</strong> - The robot might use this song to question its own existence and purpose, adding a philosophical touch.</li>  <li><strong>“P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” cover by Tinashe</strong> - A modern take on an MJ classic, signifying how the robot is still “in tune” with the world despite its isolation.</li>  <li><strong>“Off the Wall” by Michael Jackson</strong> - A more upbeat track, symbolizing moments of joy and freedom.</li>  <li><strong>“I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” by Michael Jackson</strong> - A love song that might signify the robot’s unfulfilled desires or aspirations.</li>  <li><strong>“Remember the Time” by Michael Jackson</strong> - A nostalgic track that might trigger memory cycles for the robot, reflecting on its past or original purpose.</li>  <li><strong>“Dirty Diana” cover by The Weekend</strong> - A darker, sultry track that might play when the robot travels through the night or less hospitable areas.</li>  <li><strong>“Leave Me Alone” by Michael Jackson</strong> - This song can signify the robot’s need for solitude, allowing it to focus on its journey and tasks.</li>  <li><strong>“Scream” by Michael Jackson &amp; Janet Jackson</strong> - Perfect for moments when the robot encounters frustrating obstacles or challenges and needs to vent.</li></ol><h2 id=\"thriller-in-the-wasteland-the-last-dance-with-michael-jx\">Thriller in the Wasteland: The Last Dance with Michael-JX</h2><p>In combat, the complexities of Michael-JX’s programming coalesce into a focused directive: survival through spectacle. Whether facing off against players or other threats that populate its barren stage, Michael-JX activates a more aggressive set of routines and defenses, each choreographed to the beat of its internal playlist. It’s as though the machine channels the essence of performance as a form of combat, seamlessly blending art and warfare. Every spin, moonwalk, or pirouette is transformed into a calculated strike or tactical maneuver. The music that emanates from it not only serves as a soundtrack to the unfolding drama but also acts as a cue for its various special attacks and abilities. While it may not possess desires or fears in the way living beings do, its battle mode suggests a last-ditch attempt to assert its existence, a digital defiance coded into its very being. Whether this is an eerie malfunction or an emergent self-preservation instinct is for the players to discover.</p><p>As the Michael-JX unit shifts into its battle mode, its internal algorithms work rapidly to tailor its musical output to the dynamic of the conflict at hand. The melodies morph and stretch, keys modulate, and tempos adjust in real-time to match the pace and intensity of the combat. For instance, should the players gain an upper hand, the tunes might swell to an exhilarating tempo, filling the air with fast-paced renditions of classic tracks, each note a digital rally cry spurring the machine to fight harder. Conversely, if Michael-JX begins to dominate, the music may slide into a minor key, imbuing the atmosphere with a haunting resonance that echoes its menacing posture. This adaptive musical landscape serves not merely as a backdrop but as an integral component of the battle, affecting the robot’s capabilities and perhaps even the players’ morale. It’s as though the very fabric of the encounter is woven from these sonic threads, making the music not just an aesthetic choice, but a tactical one as well.</p><h3 id=\"phase-1-introduction\">Phase 1: Introduction</h3><ol>  <li><strong>“Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” by Michael Jackson</strong>    <ul>      <li><strong>Special Ability</strong>: Energy Burst</li>      <li>The robot starts the fight by sending out a burst of energy, damaging anyone in the vicinity.

            "content_text": "IntroductionIn the expansive universe of tabletop role-playing games, your choice of weapon is more than a mere instrument of destruction; it’s a narrative tool, an extension of your character’s personality, history, and aspirations. Whether it’s a rustic blade handed down through generations or a state-of-the-art laser cannon with cosmic capabilities, each weapon carries its own set of features, mechanics, and lore that can profoundly impact how your character interacts with the game world.This exhaustive guide aims to be your definitive resource for understanding those complex intricacies. Covering every conceivable weapon property and classification from the simplest melee instruments to sophisticated cosmic weaponry, this compendium is tailored to cater to both newcomers and seasoned veterans of tabletop gaming. Whether you’re a player seeking to optimize your character build or a game master aiming to design balanced and engaging combat scenarios, this guide is your go-to resource. Dive deep into weapon attributes, material compositions, damage types, and many more categories that add layers of strategy and storytelling to your gaming experience.It’s important to note that this guide is very much a work in progress, a living document that continues to evolve. The content is culled from an extensive range of rules, documents, and materials I’ve written over the years, each contributing to the rich tapestry of information presented here. From various homebrew rules to meticulously researched data, this compilation aims to create a harmonious blend of different systems and philosophies. Your feedback and contributions are not just welcome but highly encouraged, as the goal is to make this a collaborative and comprehensive resource for the entire gaming community.Range WeaponsThrown WeaponsThese are weapons designed to be thrown with one hand, offering a versatile approach to combat.  Primary Attribute for Attack Rolls: Thrown weapons the Muscle Characteristic to determine range.  Alternate Attribute for Melee-Capable Weapons: If the thrown weapon can also be used in melee and does not have the Finesse quality, players have the option to use the character Fitness (minimum of 1) attribute for damage.  Specialization and Skill Use: If a character has a a skill in Ranged Combat, with a focus on throwing weapons, or Athletics with a specialization in throwing objects, this can be used in place of the Muscle Score to determine Range.Missile WeaponsThese weapons are designed to be thrown or fired, suitable for combat at distances greater than 5 feet. A weapon in this category has the following traits:  Ranged Combat: Effective at distances greater than 5 feet.Ammunition  With each attack, you must spend one (or more) pieces of ammunition.  – Change rule to roll the dice associated with the ammo  Some ammunition can be used as an improvised weapon.  Reloading ammunition requires two hands, even if the weapon itself can be fired with one.  You typically recover half of your ammunition spent after a battle. (No ammunition is recovered from firearms or energy weapons).  In the Weapon Stats List, damage listed for variant ammunition modifies the damage given for standard ammunition.Running Out of Ammunition  Six-shooters run out of ammunition on a failed roll that includes any 1’s showing on the dice.  Many-shot weapons run out or overheat on a failed roll that includes two or more 1’s showing on the dice.Special Cases:  If you roll a 1 on an ability dice (or equivalent), treat it as a critical failure, which may include running out of ammo or overheating, depending on the GM’s discretion.  If you roll a 2 on an attack roll, your weapon runs out or overheats, unless a 1 is also showing, in which case refer to the special case #1.Range            Märchen Range Category      Description      Traditional Range category      Distance in meters      Distance in feet      Distance in ‘squares’/inches minis scale      Other                  I can touch it      Immediate physical interaction      Close Range      up to about 2 meters      up to about 5 feet.      1 square      (Also referred to as adjacent or immediate)              I can reach it      Quick movement or extended reach      Near Range      up to about 10 meters      up to about 30 feet      6 squares      (Typical movement rate for many games)              I can catch it      Sprinting to get to a stationary object      Short Range      up to about 20 meters      up to about 60 feet      12 squares      (A typical double move action or run movement)              I can hit it with a rock      Distance for throwing objects      Medium Range      up to about 40 meters      up to about 120 feet      24 squares      (Typical long range weapon attack)              I can see it      Clear visibility, but too far to interact      Long Range      up to about 100 meters      up to about 300 feet      60 squares      (A typical long range spell attack or high tech weapon)              I can hear it      Audible but too far for visual contact      Extreme      up to about 1 kilometer      up to about 3,000 feet      600 squares      (Basically anything beyond Long range, within eyesight, and reasonable distance for the given weapon used)      Range Categories and PenaltiesWeapons have specified ranges, divided into categories as above. Each category has associated modifiers for attack rolls. Attacks can be made beyond the weapons stated range, increase the difficulty. The following traits apply:      Standard Range: Attacks made within the weapon’s specified range face no penalties.    Beyond Range:          For every additional range category beyond the initial one, impose a -2 penalty to the attack roll.      You may attempt an attack one range category beyond the listed maximum, but the attack roll suffers a -3 penalty.        Close Quarters:          Attacking with a ranged weapon while a threatening enemy is within close range (5 feet or less) imposes a disadvantage penalty on your attack roll.      If you are engaged in melee combat and attempt a ranged attack, suffer a -3 penalty.      Loading (#)This property applies to slow-loading weapons like crossbows, black powder firearms, and siege weapons.  Rate of Fire: You can only fire one piece of ammunition or make a single attack with this weapon per round, irrespective of the number of attacks or actions you have available.  Two-Handed Loading: It requires both hands to load the weapon, leaving you unable to use other weapons or items while loading.  Loading Time: The symbol “#” represents the number of actions required to reload the weapon. For instance, Loading (2) means it takes two actions to reload the weapon.  Teamwork:  For weapons that have enough space to work around that require extensive loading time, multiple characters can contribute actions to speed up the reloading process. Each contributing character must also use both hands to assist in the loading. And each character takes up space around the weapon itself.  Restrictions:  Firing and reloading this weapon takes precedence over any multi-attack features or abilities you may have. The Loading (#) property restricts you to single attacks per round even if your character normally can attack more frequently.Reload (## shots, time)This property is for weapons that have a limited ammunition capacity and must be reloaded after expended shots. Unlike weapons with the “Loading (#)” property, these can be fired every round.  Rate of Fire:  You can fire this weapon every round, assuming it has ammunition remaining. The number represented by “#” indicates the maximum number of shots you can fire before needing to reload.  Two-Handed Reloading: Reloading this weapon requires both hands, restricting you from using other items or weapons during the reload action.  Reload Time:  The second number in the parenthesis indicates the time it takes to reload the weapon.  Ammo Count: Keep track of the number of shots fired. Once you’ve reached the limit indicated by “#,” you must take the required action to reload the weapon before it can be used again.  Restrictions: While reloading, you cannot perform other actions that require your hands, like casting spells or using another weapon.Aim / Rate / Reload from Source 2Aim / Rate  / Reload. Aim is the number of actions it takes to prepare the weapon for attack.  Formally Aiming a weapon will be determined by class, proficiency and feats.  This number represents the number of actions regardless bonuses from proficiency, feats, or class that it takes to get the weapon ready to attack.Rate of Fire is the number of actions it takes to attack with the weapon.  Some weapons may take multiple actions.  Some weapons may allow for multiple attacks per action.Reload is the number of actions it takes to reload a ranged weapon.  Please see Weapon Properties on Ammunition and Firearms to further understand this action.Auto-FireFor modern and futuristic weapons that can unleash a hail of rounds in seconds. Most automatic weapons can also fire normal single shots. Auto-fire only weapons often have the Brace quality too. There are basically three ways to use auto-fire:  All auto-fire attacks are ranged attack actions made at a -2 penalty.  Single Target Burst: Maximum range is Short for this attack.  Area Burst: Affects all targets that are Close to each other (typically a 2 x 2 square). Maximum range is Long for this attack.  Sweep: Starting at one target and if possible moving to others. Maximum range is Long for this attack.  All uses consume ammunition of 10, (or run out on the numbers rolled listed below if not tracking ammo). – Fix thisDouble-ShotThis property is for firearms that can fire a couple of shots quickly, such as revolvers and semi-automatic weapons that are not fully automatic. In a Western setting, this is known as Double-Tap.  Ammunition: Using Double-Shot doubles the amount of normal ammunition needed. If using optional rules for rolling ammunition, it increases the chance of running out by 1 step.  Movement Penalty: If you move during the same round that you use Double-Shot, you suffer penalties to your attack rolls as specified below.  General: You can make a Double-Shot as a free action immediately after shooting at a target, to roll a second attack against the same target. If you hit with the second roll, the target takes normal weapon damage. The damage from this second attack is not modified in any way—it is only the damage value listed for the weapon.  Movement Penalties: Moving incurs a -2 penalty to both attacks.Rules missing that are needed  Ammo that can not be collected after a battle  Ammo that can be collected and repackaged (brass shells)  Ammo that can be used as an improvised weaponSprayThis property is for weapons spreads out, increasing the chances of hitting. Often referred to as Grape weapons/shot.  Close Range: When attacking a target within what is considered “normal” or “close” range for this weapon, players receive a special bonus of a flat +2 to the attack roll.  Beyond Close Range: When attacking a target beyond this range, the weapon deals half damage. However, the player may choose two targets that are in close proximity to each other to attack simultaneously. The bonus gained at close range does not apply here, but the attack still benefits from the multiple target effect.Flight PathRound Flight PathThis property applies to specific thrown weapons, denoting a circular flight path for the projectile.  Determining Flight Path: Establish a circular flight path with the attacker and target on opposite sides of the circle. The distance between them also sets the ‘width’ of the flight path.  Intervening Targets:  If other creatures or solid objects lie along the flight path, they become the new target.  Hit or Miss: On a hit, the weapon lands in the target’s space as usual.  On a miss, the weapon continues along the flight path if it is clear; otherwise, it targets the next creature or object in the flight path.  Weapon Return: If no targets are hit, the weapon returns to the attacker, who can spend a fast/bonus action to catch it. Otherwise, it lands within Close range of the thrower.  Missed Landings: Subtract the attacker’s attack bonus from the natural roll made for the attack. The result is the number of Close range increments away the weapon lands from the thrower. If the result is zero or less, the weapon returns as described in point 4.Scope – Merged from Source 2The weapon has been fitted with vision- enhancing sights, allowing it to put shots on target from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically Extreme Range, so long as the character aims before shooting.Area EffectArea (Radius)These weapons target everyone in the designated radius.  Size of the area determined by weapon’s Radius number.  All targets must be withing this range of all other targets.  Quite often a save/check can reduce the damage of area attacks.  Area attacks typically deal damage even on a miss or if targets make a successful check/save.Blast from source 2Upon a hit, Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.Explosive (X)This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will reduce damage in half.High-Explosive (X)This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will not reduce damage from high-explosive damage.Misfire from Source 2Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapons Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try to repair it.  To repair your firearm , you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8+ misfire score)  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.Melee Weapons OverviewMelee WeaponsThese weapons are specifically designed for close quarters combat. A weapon of this category has the following traits:  Close Quarters: Melee weapons are effective within a 5-foot range or less.Armor Penetration - AP (#)  This property is for types of weapons that slip through cracks in armor or can pound straight through a simple suit of armor.  This value does not apply against heavily armored vehicles or heavy cover (unless the weapon also has the Anti-Vehicle property).  The AP value is subtracted from the Armor Rating of the defender, if applicable.Awkward (#)Apply this property to large tools and improvised weapons, especially those that have more than one part that can cause damage, or to weapons that have several moving parts.  A critical fumble or equivalent negative outcome occurs when you roll a number represented by “#” or lower on the attack roll or relevant ability die.  If you roll “#” or lower on your Ability die, reroll the die. If you roll this value again, then it is a critical miss.  Reduce the required number of 1’s by “#”. For example, if typically two 1’s are required for a crit fumble, a weapon with “Awkward 1” would crit fumble with any 1’s showing.BarbedWeapons with barbs and back-ward-facing spikes designed to stick into a target (like a harpoon).  Weapons with this property do their normal damage when they hit.  Weapons with this property remain attached to the target on a hit.  Weapons with this property can be removed by the target, or a creature within Close range of them, by taking an action to remove the weapon with an Average skill check. On a successful result the barbed weapon is removed without damaging the target. On a failure, it is still removed, but the target takes damage again from weapon upon removal.  If the attacker still wields the weapon, they can also remove it as an action. The attacker can chose if the removal will cause additional damage on removal from the target.Brace - Merged from Source 2Bracing against the ground doubles damage against charging enemies.BulkyThis property is for high-powered weapons that require extra support to wield effectively.  If this weapon is used standing up without a harness, stand or something else to brace with, then you suffer a -2 to your ranged combat skill.  Bulky items count for two encumbrance slots.Brutal - Merged from Source 2  If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Critical Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is doubled.  If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Serendipitious Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is tripled.Charge (XX) - Merged from Source 2When moving at least XX’ in a Ounces (⏱) and attacking doubles any damage done with a successful hit.Crit (#) - Skipped needs to look atAt this stage this value only applies to Coriolis games; though I would introduce it to Mutant: Year Zero too, as it is even deadlier.Where ## equals the amount of extra 6’s required to deal a critical hit following a successful attack.Crushing - Merged from Source 2On a critical hit vs. a target of the attacker’s size or smaller, the attacker can choose to either a) disarm the target, or b) halve the target’s movement rate.Certainly, creating rules for damage-over-time effects like Radiation and Fire can add depth and complexity to combat scenarios. Here’s an attempt to create a unified rule for such effects:Damage Over Time (Time)Weapons with this property inflict damage over a period of time due to effects like Radiation, Fire, or other lingering hazards. The damage is applied at the start of each affected creature’s turn.  The weapon deals its initial damage upon a successful hit.  The target then takes additional damage equal to half the damage taken last time frame at the start of each time frame until the damage is reduced to zero.  The target can attempt a saving throws per the rules of the game to end the effect early.  A sucessful saving throw cuts the amount of damage done during the next time frame in half.Deadly - Merged from Source 2Roll damage dice with Advantage (roll damage dice twice, and keep the higher result).Defensive (#)When a weapon has the “Defensive (#)” property, it is designed to block and parry attacks more effectively.  Activation: The defensive bonus is active as long as you have not used the weapon to attack during your current turn.  Stacking: When wielding two defensive weapons, only the highest bonus is applied.  General: Add ## to your defensive valueDisarming RuleYou need to state you are attempting a disarm before making your attack roll.  Your attack deals half damage.  The target must make a Strength saving throw or equivalent, or drop their weapon. The DC for the saving throw is your attack roll result.DoubleA weapon with the “Double” property is essentially two melee weapons joined as one.  Properties: Each end retains the properties of the original weapons, except for the Two-handed property.  Usage: Double weapons require two hands to use but do not have the Two-handed property. They cannot benefit from features that affect two-handed weapons, nor can weapons with the Two-handed property be given the Double property.  Reach: If the weapon has the Reach property, only one attack per round can benefit from this property.  General: If a character has the means to fight with two weapons, double weapons qualify. This includes benefits from talents, styles, or features related to two-weapon fighting or light-weapon fighting.  Special Cases:          If both ends have the Light property, the weapon can be used to make a two-weapon fighting attack and benefits from the two-weapon fighting style.      Count as attacking with two weapons.      EntanglingThis property is for weapons that can ensnare targets, such as nets, or wrap limbs in their embrace, like bolas.  Restrained Condition: On a hit, the attacker can choose to stop the target from moving (impose the restrained condition) until the target escapes.  Size and Form Limitations: Targets two size categories larger than the attacker or targets with formless bodies are immune to this property.  Trailing Line: For weapons with a trailing line, like the whip or harpoon, the target can move but only in the direction of the attacker. If the target remains entangled, the attacker can use their action to initiate a Strength contest and, if successful, can pull the entangled target up to 10 feet towards them.  Escape: To escape, the target, or another creature within Close range, must spend an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check. The difficulty varies depending on the system.  Destroying the Weapon: Alternatively, the entangling weapon or its trailing line can be destroyed by dealing it a certain amount of slashing damage. The weapon can only be attacked when it is restraining a target.Fast Toggle (Timeframe)Many futuristic and modern weapons have different settings built into a weapon. Changing settings requires that you spend a certain amount of time making the changes.  Changing settings requires a “Timeframe” to be spent toggling the weapon to another configuration.Fast Draw (Timeframe)Some weapons require that you spend a give time frame getting them ready for use in combat.  Readying this equipment requires a “Timeframe” to be spent setting up the weapon before it can be used.FinesseThis property is for light, fast weapons.  General: When wielding a weapon with the Finesse property, you can substitute a more agile or accurate attribute (like Dexterity, Speed, Accuracy, or Agility) in place of a more strength-oriented attribute (like Strength, Might, Fighting, or Athletics) for the attack bonus and damage die.Fragile/ScrapThis property is for weapons made of brittle or less durable materials such as wood, stone, bone, or even metal weapons that are thin or improperly made. These weapons are prone to damage and may require frequent repair.  Reduced Armor Penetration: All weapons with the Fragile/Scrap property halve any Armor Penetration values they may have, rounded down.  Wear and Tear: Each time the weapon rolls the minimum damage value, it takes a penalty to its damage rolls. If this penalty accumulates beyond -4, the weapon is considered destroyed.  Repair:  Someone with the appropriate tools and proficiency can repair the weapon. The time it takes to remove each -1 penalty is one hour per penalty point.  Weapon Longevity: The threshold before the weapon is destroyed, as well as the means of repair.Gear Bonus(+/- #)For YZE games only (Coriolis &amp; Mutant: Year Zero).Where ## equals the number of gear dice you roll for attacks.Handed (x)Requires X number of hands; the character cannot use a shield unless they have an additional hand free.Two-HandedYou must use two hands to use these weapons.HeavyHeavyWeapons with this property are cumbersome and difficult to use under certain conditions. They are not well-suited for confined spaces, nor are they easy to wield when mounted. These weapons also prove challenging for smaller creatures.  Mounted or Cramped Conditions: Using a Heavy weapon while mounted or in cramped conditions imposes penalties of -2 attack rolls.  Size Limitations: Creatures smaller than the intended size category for the weapon always suffer the imposed penalties.  Off-Hand Restrictions: Heavy weapons cannot be used in the off-hand.  Encumbrance:  - Heavy weapons count as two items for the purpose of encumbrance calculations.Knock-out – Merged from Source 2On a critical hit, the target must save vs. paralysis or be knocked outfor 1d6 turns. The target must be the attacker’s size or smaller, andhave biological susceptibility to being rendered unconscious from blunttrauma to the head.LightLightWeapons with this property are small, easy to handle, and ideal for quick, agile combat. These weapons are beneficial for characters who prioritize speed and finesse over raw power.  Encumbrance:  Light weapons count as half an item for encumbrance purposes. Two light items can fill one line of your Gear/Equipment chart.  Dual Wielding: When wielding a Light weapon in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make an off-hand attack with another Light weapon. The off-hand attack does not add your ability score to its damage.Mass ProducedWeapons, ammunition, tools, or armor of this quality are made quickly and with cheaper materials, often by societies that are at higher tech levels then those that introduced the item. A Mass Produced item has the following drawbacks:  -1 to Damage: Subtracts -1 from all damage rolls made with this weapon. This penalty does stack with magical penalties, if the weapon is or becomes cursed.  -1 to Hit: Subtracts -1 from all hit rolls made with this weapon. This penalty does stack with magical penalties, if the weapon is or becomes cursed.  No Choice: The penalties to hit and damage are both automatically applied, and cannot be chosen or mitigated.  Limited Evolution: Mass Produced items can never become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.  Limited Repairability: Mass Produced items take twice as long to repair and clean.  High-Tech Mass Production: A society that is of higher tech levels than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce the item.  Reduced Cost: Costing half the amount it normally would, representing the economies of scale achieved through high-tech mass production.  Reduced Time: Creating a mass produced item will take half the normal amount of time.  Bulk Production: When a mass-produced item is built, the process generates 2 additional items of the same type for the same production cost, representing the efficiency of mass production systems.  Fragile: Due to cost-cutting measures, the mass-produced item is fragile and more susceptible to breaking.Masterwork RuleWeapons of this quality are made with exceptional skill and materials. A Masterwork weapon grants the following benefits:  +1 to Damage: Adds +1 to all damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.  +1 to Hit: Adds +1 to all hit rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.  Exclusivity: The person building the masterwork weapon must choose between +1 to hit or +1 to damage, but not both.  Greater Things to Come: Masterwork items may become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.  Tender Love and Care: Typically adds an additional 1 month wage for the weapons smith of ₢ of in-game currency to the weapon’s base value.Mass Produced.  A society that is two tech levels higher than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce weapon, ammunition, or armor.  When this is done, the weapon acts like it is fragile as well costing half the amount it costs normally.Operators Rule (#)Weapons in this game may require a specific number of people to operate them effectively, especially in the case of large siege weapons or higher-tech level equipment. The “Operators” characteristic defines this requirement:  Single-Operator: Weapons with this designation require only one person to operate. These are typically handheld or easily managed weapons.  Multi-Operator: Weapons with this designation require more than one person to operate successfully. The specific number needed will be listed alongside the weapon’s description. For example, a trebuchet might list “Operators: 3” to indicate that it requires three people for optimal use.  Tech-Dependent: Higher-tech level weapons may require a larger operating crew due to their complexity. The number of operators will be listed in the weapon’s description and could change depending on the tech level of the society using it.One Use WeaponsWeapons with this designation are engineered for a single use, expending all their energy or ammunition in one action. After use, they are rendered inoperative. The following traits apply:  Single Use: Once activated, this weapon is expended and cannot be used again.  Expended Resources: All ammunition or energy is used up in a single attack, making the weapon useless thereafter.  Disposable: The only thing this weapon is good for after its use is as an improved weapon.Quick DrawWeapons with this attribute are designed for rapid deployment, enabling the wielder to ready and use the weapon as part of the same action. The following traits apply:  Swift Action: This weapon can be readied (drawn or prepared for use) as part of the same action used to attack.Reach WeaponsWeapons with this trait are designed to strike at enemies from a greater distance than most melee weapons. A Reach weapon has the following characteristics:      Extended Reach: Adds an additional 2 meters/5 feet to your attack range when using this weapon, effectively doubling your Close range for attacks.        On Hold: If armed with a Reach weapon and not surprised, you can be considered to be on hold for the purposes of attacking an advancing foe only. If someone moves within your reach, you may attack immediately.        Close Quarters Penalty:          Attacks against foes within Close range (usually 5 feet or less) impose a specific penalty of a -2 on your attack roll:      Readied WeaponsWeapons with this property are designed for strategic placement, generally piercing weapons that can be braced or planted in the ground for an opportunity attack.  Conditions for Use: You must not have a hostile creature able to take actions within Close range of you to utilize this feature.  Defensive Reaction: Once per round, if a foe tries to move into Close range with you, you can use your reaction to make a free melee attack against that target with your readied weapon.  Special Effects on Hit: If your attack hits, the attack automatically deals an additional +2 damage.Reliable WeaponsThese are weapons of exceptional quality, with intricate yet robust mechanics that minimize the chance of malfunction or failure.  Reduced Critical Misses: Your negative results are still a miss, and you may not escalate a miss into a hit, however your miss is always one rank closer to the middle using a reliable weapon.  Negating Negative Outcomes: If you roll and the result is a 1, you may reroll that die to negate this. If the second roll converts the result into a success, you still miss but with no negative outcomes.  Increased Cost for Referee Interference: The cost for the Referee to trigger a weapon jam or similar negative effect is double for this piece of gear, making it less likely to happen.  Greater Things to Come: Reliable items may become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.  Tender Love and Care: Typically adds an additional 1 month wage for the weapons smith of ₢ of in-game currency to the weapon’s base value.SerratedSerratedWeapons with this quality are designed to rip and tear through flesh, making them highly effective against unprotected or lightly armored targets. Note that this quality only applies to weapons that deal slashing damage.      Armor Penetration: Weapons with this quality lose the Armor Penetration quality.        Rend Armor Hitting an unarmored target allows you to use a fast action or maneuver to deal an extra point of damage. If you hit a target with light armor, you can then on perform a fast action to reduce their Armor rating by 1; armor reduced to 0 rating is destroyed, making the target unarmored for future attacks.  Shield Grappler – Merged from Source 2Attacking with this weapon negates an opponent’s shield.SilentThis quality is for modern weapons. It could be due to an added silencer at the end of a gun barrel or a setting on a futuristic blaster.  Silent Trade-Off Weapons on silent mode deal 1 less damage.  Whispers Requires an Observation/Scout roll to hear.SlowThis is for weapons that require time to be used repeatedly.  This weapon cannot be fired in consecutive rounds.  On any other round a maximum of 1 attack can be made with this weapon, even if you have the means to make more than one attack.  If this weapon is moved manually (not vehicle mounted), it must be set-up required at least 1 round.Smart – Merged from Source 2This weapon has intelligent or semi-intelligent rounds that are able to guide themselves onto a target. They gain a DM to their attack rolls equal to the difference between their TL and that of the target, to a minimum of ⚅+1 and a maximum of ⚅+6.Specialized – Merged from Source 2Only classes with Strength as a prime requisite can wield this weapon efficiently. All others suffer a -4 penalty to hit.Splash X – Merged from Source 2On a successful attack, the container smashes and douses the target with the contents. Damage is inflicted over X “rounds.”Stealth – Merged fom Source 2May only be used to attack an unaware person (i.e. human / demi-human of any level or humanoid monster of up to 4+1 HD) from behind. Any successful attack with this weapon is considered to be a critical hit.Strangle – Merged from Source 2Following a successful hit, this weapon inflicts automatic damage each round. The victim cannot move and suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A successful hit on the attacker allows the victim to break free.StunThis quality is for modern weapons. It is a typical setting for blasters in a futuristic settings and even batons from such settings may have this property. Also known as zap weapons.  Unless noted otherwise, stun settings only work out to Short range.  Deals stress (or Wits &amp; then Empath) damage. A critical success stuns the target for the next round: they cannot take any actions.Thermal SweepFor futuristic weapons that fire a continuous beam that can be swept across several enemies.Works as Auto-Fire (Sweep)TinyThis property is mostly for ammunition, though it could represent smaller weapons carried by small characters too.Tiny items do not count towards encumbrance.Toggle (#)Weapons with this quality have a trailing line that can connect to targets. The line’s length is denoted by “#.” When a weapon with the Toggle and either Barbed or Entangling properties hits a target, the following rules apply:      Line Connection: A trailing line connects the target to the attacker. The attacker determines the length of the line, up to “#” units.    Breaking the Line: To break the line, the target (or an ally) must:          Deal 2 slashing damage, (against standard target number ).      Make a Strength or Might check, with the difficulty varying by system (against a standard target number).            Restricted Movement: If the connected target wishes to move beyond the length of the line, they must succeed in an opposed Strength check against the wielder.    Wielder’s Choice: If the target successfully moves away, the wielder can either:          Drop the weapon, which will be dragged away by the target.      Spend a action to keep the weapon. If the weapon has the Barbed property, pulling it free deals damage to the target as per the Barbed rules.      TrippingFor weapons that have hooks or protrusions made to take people to ground, or entangling weapons like whips that can be used to yank legs out from under foes.  This only works on a creature up to one size category larger than the wielder of the disarming weapon.  You can choose to deal half damage and knock the target prone.UnbalancingWeapons with this quality are typically weighted or designed in a way that they can throw the wielder off balance if not used effectively. If you attack and miss your target with an Unbalancing weapon, the next melee attack against you gains a +2 bonus before your next turn unless you spend a fast action to recover.VersatileVersatile weapons are flexible in terms of how they can be used. They can be wielded with one or two hands, offering various benefits depending on the method. The rules for small creatures and for ranged and melee uses differ.Melee &amp; Ranged: When used in two hands, you can reroll any one die not showing a 1. Size-Dependent Handling: Small creatures must wield these weapons in two hands but use the standard damage. If a small creature attempts to use the weapon in one hand, the weapon is treated as having the Heavy property.Very BulkySome weapons are designed only for the strongest combatants. A characterusing a Very Bulky weapon must have Strength 12 or higher to use it withoutpenalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal tothe difference between their Strength DM and +2.Wrap-AroundFor weapons that have large hooks or flexible components capable of wrapping around shields.  Weapons with the wrap-around property ignore any defense bonus a target has due to using a shield or weapon with the defensive property.Zero-G – Merged from Source 2This weapon has little or no recoil, allowing it to be used in low or zero gravity situations without requiring an Athletics (dexterity) check.Weapon Construction Materials from Gamma World to 5th Edition D&amp;DStone WeaponsLight and one-handed bludgeoning weapons, spears, axes, and daggers can all be made of stone.  Stone weapons are two thirds the weight of their base weapons  Stone weapons take a –1 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 damage)  Stone weapons have the fragile property  Stone weapons can be manufactured by TL0 and aboveBone (Horn, shell, and ivory) WeaponsBone can be used in place of wood and steel in weapons.  Light and one-handed melee weapons, as well as two-handed weapons that deal bludgeoning damage only, can be crafted from bone. Hafted two-handed weapons such as spears can be crafted with bone. Other two-handed weapons cannot be constructed of bone.  Bone weapons are one third the weight of their base weapons  Bone weapons take a –2 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 damage)  Bone weapons have the the fragile property  Stone weapons can be manufactured by TL0 and aboveUnworked Wooden WeaponsLight and one-handed melee weapons, as well as two-handed weapons that deal bludgeoning damage only, can be crafted from unworked wood. Hafted two-handed weapons such as spears can be crafted entirely of wood. Other two-handed weapons cannot be constructed of wood.  Unworked wood weapons have the the fragile property.  Rustic Wood weapons take a –3 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 point damage)  Unworked Wooden weapons can be manufactured by TL0 and aboveBronze (Brass, Copper, or Tin) WeaponsBefore the advent of iron and steel, bronze ruled the world. This easily worked metal can be used in place of steel for both weapons and armor. For simplicity’s sake, similar or component metals such as brass, copper, or even tin can use the following rules, even though in reality bronze is both harder and more reliable than those metals.All weapons that can be made out of steel can also be made out of bronze.  Bronze weapons have the same weight and do the same damage as steel weapons of the same type.  Bronze weapons have the the fragile property  Bronze weapons can be manufactured by TL1 and aboveIronItems without metal parts cannot be made from iron. An arrow could be made of iron, but a standard quarterstaff could not.  Iron weapons lose all Light and Finesse properties  Iron weapons weigh one and one half times as much as the same item made from steel  Iron weapons can be manufactured by TL1 and aboveSteelItems listed in the manual are steel weapons.  Steel weapons can be manufactured by TL2 and aboveSynthetic Metal (Durasteel, Plasteel, Duralloy, Titanium Alloy)An item made from Synthetic Metal weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals.  Synthetic Metal is too light to be used for Heavy weapons and lose their effectiveness  Synthetic Metal weapons become Light weapons  Synthetic Metal Light weapons gain the Finesse property  Synthetic Metal Two-Handed weapons are now versatile instead  Synthetic Metal Ammunition it too light to be effective  TL5 Synthetic Metal weapons can only be Light  Synthetic Metal weapons can be manufactured by TL5 and aboveSynthetic Crystal (Ceramic, Diamond, Crysteel, Glassteel)Melee weapons and ammunition made with synthetic crystals are unusually effective when used to break objects.  Synthetic Crystals weapons and ammunition, when they hit, always hit with a critical hit.  TL5 Synthetic Crystals are Fragile and can not be used for ammunition  Synthetic Crystals weapons can be manufactured by TL5 and aboveWeapon Size Increases  Large weapons have double the number of dice they had at normal size.  Huge weapons have triple the number of dice they had a normal size.  Gargantuan weapons have quadruple the number of dice they had a normal size.  A weapon sized for an attacker one size larger is used at a disadvantage.  A weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the attacker to use at all.Weapon Size Decreases  Weapons manufactured for Small attackers use the medium weapon charts.  Small Attackers may use medium weapons at no disadvantage.  Small attackers use heavy weapons at a disadvantage.  Weapons manufactured for Tiny creatures do half damage.  Heavy Weapons may not be manufactured for Tiny Creatures.  A weapon sized for an attacker one size smaller is used at a disadvantage.  A weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes smaller is too small for the attacker to use at all.Damage TypeAcid DamageAcid damage often represents corrosive substances that eat away at materials and flesh alike. Whether it’s a vial of acid thrown by an alchemist, a dragon’s acidic breath, or an environmental hazard, acid damage brings a sense of relentless, unstoppable dissolution to the table.  Acid damage can be highly varied and tailored to fit the mood, technology level, and general theme of your campaign, making it a versatile and evocative tool in a game master’s arsenal.Acid Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn a classic fantasy realm, acid damage might come from a variety of sources. Potions or flasks of acid could be commonly sold in arcane shops or used by tricky rogues. Some creatures, like black dragons or oozes, are well-known for their acid-based attacks. Wizards and sorcerers may also have spells at their disposal that conjure acidic clouds or bolts.Acid Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn science fiction campaigns, acid damage could be delivered via specially designed weapons that shoot corrosive substances, or it could be an environmental hazard on an alien planet. Acid might also be used as a weapon of mass destruction, capable of melting through spaceship hulls or robotic exteriors.Acid Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsImagine running into a criminal gang that employs acid as a weapon, or perhaps a creature of myth hiding in the city sewers with corrosive saliva. Acid might also be a hazardous material in a chemical plant, providing a mundane but dangerous obstacle for players to navigate.Acid Damage in Horror SettingsIn horror settings, acid could be a particularly gruesome way to showcase the terror of a scene. Whether it’s an acidic trap set up by a malevolent entity or a creature whose touch dissolves flesh, acid damage can heighten the stakes and horror.Acid Damage in Historical SettingsWhether it’s the ancient world or a more recent setting, acid could be employed in a number of ways, from primitive corrosive substances used in traps to more modern scientific applications. In war settings, acid could be used as a primitive form of chemical warfare.Acid Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a world where resources are scarce, acid might become a highly sought-after weapon. It could be harvested from mutated creatures or manufactured in rudimentary labs. Traps using acid could also be a common way to protect valuable resources.Acid Damage in Steampunk SettingsAcid in a steampunk setting might come from elaborate brass and glass contraptions that spray the substance, or it could be part of the exhaust from a steam-powered machine gone haywire.Bludgeoning DamageBludgeoning damage is the most straightforward and one of the most versatile types of damage, representing impact force against a target. This could be from a club, a falling rock, or a giant’s fist. It’s a primal and direct form of damage that lends itself to all sorts of contexts and settings.  Bludgeoning damage is a universal concept that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or genre. It’s a fundamental form of harm that resonates on a basic level, making it a versatile choice for all kinds of storytelling scenarios.Bludgeoning Damage in Fantasy SettingsBludgeoning is perhaps most commonly seen in fantasy settings, where weapons like hammers, maces, and staves are abundant. Monsters like hill giants or trolls may use large clubs or even their fists to deal bludgeoning damage. Traps in ancient temples might release rolling boulders, and magic spells could call down meteor showers.Bludgeoning Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn a science fiction context, bludgeoning damage could come from advanced, but non-lethal crowd-control weapons designed to subdue rather than kill. It could also be the result of a spaceship crash or a mechanical arm gone rogue. Even in high-tech settings, the simplicity of bludgeoning means it’s never obsolete.Bludgeoning Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn modern settings, bludgeoning damage often takes on a gritty, street-level quality. It might come from baseball bats in a gang fight, or rubber bullets used by riot police. In urban fantasy, mystical beings might employ ancient hammers or other legendary blunt instruments that carry both physical and magical weight.Bludgeoning Damage in Horror SettingsIn horror games, bludgeoning is the staple of many a terrifying foe. Whether it’s a crazed killer with a sledgehammer or an undead monstrosity with overwhelming strength, bludgeoning damage in horror is often portrayed as brutal and gruesome.Bludgeoning Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical campaigns, the technology and weaponry might define the types of bludgeoning damage encountered. In a Roman campaign, it could be the wooden clubs of barbarians, while in medieval Japan it could be the bo staff or kanabo (a spiked or studded two-handed club).Bludgeoning Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn post-apocalyptic worlds, bludgeoning takes on a makeshift quality. Makeshift weapons like crowbars, tire irons, or even simple rocks become essential tools for survival. Bludgeoning damage here is raw and desperate, emblematic of the harshness of life in a ruined world.Bludgeoning Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk universe, expect to see elaborate mechanical hammers, pneumatic fists, or even steam-powered mauls. These often combine the aesthetic of the setting with the primal effectiveness of bludgeoning damage.Cold DamageCold damage represents harm inflicted through extremely low temperatures, freezing winds, or ice-based magical or elemental attacks. It’s a damage type that often has the added effect of slowing down or immobilizing targets, making it a tactical option in various settings.  Cold damage offers a versatile and often tactical form of harm that can be adapted to any setting. It can be a straightforward combat concern, an environmental obstacle, or a mood-setting element, making it a useful addition to any game master’s repertoire.Cold Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn a fantasy world, cold damage might come from ice dragons, frost mages, or enchanted weapons imbued with chilling magic. The wilderness itself, particularly tundra or icy mountain ranges, can be a source of environmental cold damage.Cold Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn a futuristic or space-faring campaign, cold damage could be inflicted by advanced cryo-weapons or malfunctioning life support systems in a spaceship. Planets with harsh, sub-zero climates may also serve as environments where cold damage is a constant concern.Cold Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn a modern setting, cold damage might stem from liquid nitrogen traps or experimental cold-based weaponry. In urban fantasy, perhaps a being from Norse mythology brings with it a frigid aura, or a rogue scientist has developed a freeze ray that’s causing havoc.Cold Damage in Horror SettingsCold damage in a horror setting adds an element of dread and creeping doom. It might manifest through malevolent spirits that bring a chill to the air, or a dark ritual that plummets the temperature in an area, slowing characters both physically and mentally.Cold Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical settings, cold damage is often an environmental concern. For example, expeditions into the Arctic or soldiers on winter campaigns could face the dangers of frostbite and hypothermia, which could be represented as cold damage in game terms.Cold Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic setting, the collapse of modern infrastructure might mean a harsh winter presents a significant danger. Alternatively, some apocalyptic event might have thrown the climate into chaos, making cold damage a frequent concern.Cold Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn steampunk settings, imaginative devices like “Frost Cannons” or “Icy Ether Projectors” could be sources of cold damage. Inventors and scientists may have devised various ways to weaponize cold, adding a touch of Victorian flair to the elemental force.Fire DamageFire damage is a classic and evocative form of harm, symbolizing both destruction and cleansing. Whether it comes from a dragon’s breath, a Molotov cocktail, or a high-tech flamethrower, fire damage often comes with the added complication of potentially spreading or affecting an area.  Fire damage is a dramatic and multi-faceted form of harm that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or storyline. It’s both a practical combat concern and a powerful thematic element, making it a useful and engaging tool in any game master’s toolkit.Fire Damage in Fantasy SettingsFire is a staple in fantasy settings, and it manifests in myriad ways. Wizards might launch fireballs, while warriors could wield flaming swords. Red dragons, fire elementals, and various demonic creatures often deal fire damage. Magical traps that erupt in flame are also common in ancient dungeons.Fire Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn science fiction, fire damage could come from advanced energy weapons that emulate the effect of fire on a molecular level. Flamethrowers and incendiary rounds can cause fire damage, as could the dangerous environment of an alien planet with methane lakes that can ignite.Fire Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsModern settings offer a variety of sources for fire damage, from Molotov cocktails thrown in a street protest to arson attacks. In urban fantasy, ancient artifacts might conjure fire, or magical creatures like phoenixes might bring their own fiery destruction to the modern world.Fire Damage in Horror SettingsFire often serves as a dual symbol in horror settings: a destroyer and a purifier. It could be that the only way to vanquish an undead abomination is to set it aflame, or perhaps a malevolent spirit sets lethal fires. Either way, fire damage in horror can be both a threat and a tool for players.Fire Damage in Historical SettingsIn a historical setting, fire damage can come from a variety of sources depending on the time period. In ancient sieges, flaming arrows and pots of burning oil were used. In more recent times, the advent of firearms and artillery brought explosive rounds that could cause fire damage.Fire Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn post-apocalyptic worlds, fire is often a primal force again, necessary for survival but also a constant hazard. Makeshift weapons like flaming arrows or fuel-filled bottles become more common, and the destruction of modern firefighting methods might make fire damage more pervasive and dangerous.Fire Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk universe, expect to see fantastical contraptions that shoot jets of flame or incendiary rounds. Fire may also be a byproduct of the many steam-powered machines that populate the world, making it a common environmental hazard.Force DamageForce damage is a unique and often magical form of energy that bypasses most forms of physical resistance. It represents a pure, raw exertion of energy, often manifested as invisible or ethereal blasts, barriers, or waves. This type of damage is commonly associated with arcane or divine sources but can also occur due to technological means in certain settings.  Force damage is a versatile and often mysterious form of harm that can appear in a wide array of settings. It’s typically less straightforward than physical types of damage, offering a range of creative and tactical possibilities that can add depth and intrigue to any campaign.Force Damage in Fantasy Settings SettingsIn a fantasy realm, force damage is often the purview of arcane spellcasters. Spells that shoot bolts of arcane energy or generate waves of concussive force may have the capability to inflict force damage. Certain enchanted items or artifacts may also deliver force damage when activated.Force Damage in Sci-Fi Settings SettingsIn science fiction worlds, force damage could be related to advanced technology like force fields, gravity-manipulating devices, or particle beams. It could also come from psionic abilities, where mental force is made manifest to damage or repel enemies.Force Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn modern or urban fantasy settings, force damage could manifest through esoteric martial arts that focus energy, or through technological means like experimental weapons. It might also come from powerful artifacts hidden in plain sight, like a seemingly innocuous pendant that unleashes a burst of force energy when activated.Force Damage in Horror SettingsIn a horror game, force damage could be associated with malevolent spirits or curses that exert a damaging influence on the physical world. It could also manifest as an extension of forbidden arcane or eldritch knowledge, hurting those who dare to meddle with the unknown.Force Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical settings, force damage might be limited to legendary artifacts, divine interventions, or other extraordinary circumstances. For example, a holy relic could emit a burst of force energy when used to fend off unholy creatures.Force Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn post-apocalyptic scenarios, remnants of advanced technology or lost arcane knowledge might be the sources of force damage. A scavenged piece of tech or a rediscovered spellbook could provide characters with a unique advantage.Force Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk world, experimental “force cannons” or “aetheric pulse devices” might deliver bursts of concentrated force. These could be the inventions of mad scientists, or perhaps based on arcane principles rediscovered and mechanized through steampunk ingenuity.Electrical Damage  Fire: target of a fire attack may continue to burn (use the fire rules for the system being used).  &lt;– this needs to change  Ion: this damages electronics and droids only.Electrical damage represents the raw power of electricity or other types of intense energy. Whether it’s a bolt of lightning from the sky, an electrical trap, or a futuristic laser, this damage type is often fast, focused, and devastating. It can also carry the additional effect of disrupting systems, whether those are magical constructs or technological devices.  Electrical damage is a flexible and dynamic type of harm that can find a place in almost any kind of setting. It can represent the raw power of the elements, the dangers of technology, or the mysterious energy of arcane or extraterrestrial origin, offering a myriad of storytelling possibilities.Electrical Damage in Fantasy Settings SettingsIn traditional fantasy worlds, lightning is often the domain of storm gods, powerful sorcerers, and certain types of dragons. Spells like “Chain Lightning” or “Shocking Grasp” can deal electrical damage, and magical items like a “Staff of Thunder and Lightning” could give players a shocking edge.Electrical Damage in Sci-Fi Settings SettingsIn a science fiction landscape, energy-based weapons like laser guns or plasma rifles would deal this type of damage. Electrical hazards might also come from malfunctioning equipment, security systems, or the natural phenomena of exotic planets.Ion Damage  By means of massive electromagnetic pulses, overloading or power systems or other exotic effects, ion weapons have the potential to temporarily disrupt critical systems on board a ship without causing permanent damage. This can give a vital edge in combat while an enemy ship recovers or force an enemy to surrender before the disabling attack is followed up by something far more potent.  Instead of dealing damage as usual, Ion weapons use the following rules.      When an Ion weapon successfully hits a target, roll for its damage but ignore any armour the target possesses. Instead of applying damage to the target’s hull, it is instead temporarily deducted from the target’s Power, representing the disabling effects as they spread throughout the ship and the crew working hard to keep the most vital systems online.    This reduction in Power will last until the target completes its next set of actions, in either the current Ounces (⏱) or the next.    If the Effect of the attack roll is 6 or more, the reduction in Power will last for D3 rounds.  Electrical Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsElectricity is a modern marvel, and in contemporary settings, it might be weaponized in the form of tasers, electrical traps, or experimental energy weapons. In urban fantasy, an electrical attack could also be magical in origin, perhaps from a modern wizard or a mythological creature adapted to urban life.Electrical Damage in Horror SettingsIn horror settings, electrical damage can take on an even darker tone, perhaps being employed in torturous or sadistic ways. Haunted or cursed electrical systems can fry unsuspecting victims, and otherworldly entities might possess the power to manipulate electrical energy.Electrical Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical settings, instances of electrical damage might be rare but could still appear in the form of lightning storms or rare alchemical devices. Devices like the Leyden jar, an antique form of a capacitor, could be an interesting basis for an electrical trap or weapon.Electrical Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic world, remnants of old technology could provide electrical damage capabilities, either as booby traps protecting valuable resources or as jury-rigged weapons. Natural occurrences like lightning storms may also be more dangerous in a world where shelter is scarce.Electrical Damage in Steampunk SettingsElectrical damage in steampunk could come from “aetheric generators,” “lightning guns,” or other wildly imaginative gadgets. As steampunk often bridges the gap between magic and technology, these devices could operate on principles of electricity, arcane energy, or a blend of both.Radiation DamageRadiation damage deals with forms of energy that decay or corrupt living tissue. Radiation damage is often associated with the dark arts, death, decay, and is linked to dangerous isotopes or high-energy particles. This damage type has long-term harmful effects, including persistent wounds or lingering sickness.  This damage type offers rich narrative opportunities for harm that’s not just immediate but also potentially lingering. It can serve to heighten the stakes, introduce new challenges, and add layers of complexity to your storytelling. Whether sourced from dark magic or dangerous technology, these forms of damage can bring a sense of urgency and menace to any campaign.Radiation Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn a fantasy world, this damage is typically the domain of dark mages, necromancers, or undead creatures. Spells that channel harmful energies to directly harm the body, or items such as swords imbued with malevolent magic that cause degeneration, are common sources of this type of effect. Scientific sources of this damage is less common but might appear in the form of cursed lands or arcane fallout from a magical catastrophe.Radiation Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsRadiation damage is a natural fit for science fiction settings, especially in dystopian or post-apocalyptic scenarios. Radiation can come from nuclear weapons, malfunctioning reactors, or cosmic phenomena. Alien technology or biology might also be the source of the effect.Radiation Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn modern settings, radiation damage could result from nuclear accidents or terrorist attacks using “dirty bombs.” While hidden necromancers, cursed artifacts, or secret societies practicing dark arts could also provide a source of this damage.Radiation Damage in Horror SettingsThis damage damage in horror settings can be the result of curses, dark rituals, or malevolent entities seeking to drain the life from victims. This damage type can add a layer of existential dread, emanating from forbidden technologies or eldritch phenomena that corrupt and decay.Radiation Damage in Historical SettingsThis damage type could appear in ancient curses, dark rites, or through exposure to unholy artifacts. Its less likely to be encountered elsewhere but it could be introduced through mysterious substances (like uranium unknowingly used in old pottery) or as a divine punishment in myths.Radiation Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsThis damage type is common in post-apocalyptic settings. This energy could be a byproduct of the apocalyptic event itself, emanating from the undead or corrupted lands. This damage is a staple in post-nuclear settings, where radiation zones and isotopes pose constant threats.Radiation Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn steampunk worlds, this damage type could be channeled through dark aetheric energies or alchemical concoctions, and it could be an unintended side effect of new, steam-powered technologies. Mad scientists and dark inventors might utilize these energies to create potent but perilous weapons.Piercing DamagePiercing damage represents the act of penetrating or puncturing an object or creature with a sharp or pointed implement. It’s a common form of damage that ranges from arrows and spears to bullets and laser beams, depending on the setting. Piercing attacks often excel at bypassing armor or hitting vital areas.  Piercing damage is a versatile and widespread form of harm that has a place in almost any genre or setting. It’s often associated with precision and skill, and can introduce a range of tactical options for players and NPCs alike. From the traditional bowman to the futuristic sharpshooter, characters specializing in piercing damage often bring a unique set of capabilities to their parties.Piercing Damage in Fantasy SettingsPiercing damage is a staple in fantasy worlds, often dealt by archers, rogues, or warriors using weapons like longbows, crossbows, or daggers. Mythical creatures like manticores or wyverns might also have piercing attacks, like spines or stingers.Piercing Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn futuristic settings, piercing damage could be delivered by advanced firearms, railguns, or even focused laser beams that punch through armor. Alien species might possess natural abilities to deal piercing damage, such as proboscises or spines.Piercing Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsModern firearms like handguns and sniper rifles typically deal piercing damage. In an urban fantasy setting, even magical creatures might use firearms, or perhaps their natural attacks like fangs or quills deal piercing damage.Piercing Damage in Horror SettingsIn horror games, piercing damage can be particularly gruesome, often dealt by instruments of torture or weapons like meat hooks and syringes. Supernatural creatures might also have fangs, talons, or spines that deal piercing damage.Piercing Damage in Historical SettingsHistorical settings offer a plethora of piercing weapons based on the technology of the time. From slingshots and bows to muskets and early firearms, piercing damage is often the most common form of ranged attack.Piercing Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a world after civilization’s fall, piercing damage might come from makeshift weapons like crossbows or sharpened pieces of scrap metal. Traps made of sharp objects are also more likely in a world where sophisticated weaponry is scarce.Piercing Damage in Steampunk SettingsSteampunk worlds may feature innovative piercing weapons like clockwork crossbows, pneumatic spearguns, or mechanically-enhanced throwing knives. These could combine traditional mechanisms with steam or aetheric energy to add a fantastical element to otherwise conventional piercing weapons.Ballistic (Type)Ballistic damage is the type of damage that firearms inflict. It is a subset of piercing damage.  All ballistic damage counts as piercing damage,  Not all piercing damage counts as ballistic damage.  Stuff that is resistance to piercing damage is also resistant to ballistic damage.  Stuff that is resistant to ballistic damage is not automatically resistant to piercing damage.Additional Rules needed?  Is there something above ballistic?Poison Damage  This weapon inflicts no damage, but may administer a bloodstream poison.  Endurance Check Difficulty. This is a number -4 thru 4  Damage: This is the damage taken  Effects: This is the targets condition if the check is unsuccessful(dead, unconscious, Coma, etc..)  Interval: This how frequently the check must be made  Contagious: This is how frequently someone else in contact with thevictim can become sickPoison damage represents the harmful effects of toxic substances, venom, or noxious gases. It can be a slow-acting threat that gradually weakens a character or a fast-acting toxin that deals immediate harm. Poison damage often comes with secondary effects like weakening, disorientation, or ongoing damage over time.  Poison damage offers a host of narrative and tactical possibilities, bringing a sense of danger, urgency, and complexity to a game. Whether it’s the simple poison of a snakebite or the engineered toxin of a futuristic assassin, poison damage can challenge characters in unique ways and add layers to storytelling.Poison Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn a fantasy realm, poison damage can be the weapon of choice for assassins, rogue alchemists, or sinister mages. Creatures like spiders, snakes, and wyverns might have poisonous bites or stingers. Magical poisons with unique properties can also be a feature.Poison Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn science fiction, poison could be a form of biochemical warfare, an alien venom, or an environmental hazard on a newly explored planet. Futuristic technology might offer new delivery systems for poisons, such as drones or nanobotsPoison Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn a modern setting, poison could come in the form of industrial chemicals, illegal narcotics, or even household items that have been tampered with. Urban fantasy might feature magical or mythical creatures with poisonous abilities, hiding in plain sight.Poison Damage in Horror SettingsPoison in horror games adds an element of suspense and urgency, as characters may have to find an antidote or cure before time runs out. This could range from a cursed vial of liquid to a monster’s venomous bite.Poison Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical contexts, poison has been used in various forms, from arsenic and belladonna to poisoned arrows and tainted food. Assassinations, warfare, and political intrigue often feature poison as a central element.Poison Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic setting, poisons might be more prevalent due to the breakdown of industrial safeguards. Polluted water sources, toxic waste, and poisonous plants or mutated animals could all be potential dangers.Poison Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk universe, poisons could be intricately engineered concoctions, delivered through clockwork syringes or aerosol sprays. They might be the creations of mad scientists, nefarious industrialists, or rogue inventors.Mental DamageMental damage targets the psyche, affecting the target’s thought processes, emotions, or even core beliefs. It can manifest in various forms such as confusion, disorientation, or debilitating fear. Unlike Mystical damage, which directly assaults the mind, mental damage tends to alter or manipulate mental states rather than harm them outright. This type of damage often sidesteps traditional armor and physical defenses.  Mental damage provides a nuanced challenge that targets a character’s mental resilience rather than their physical durability. It offers unique storytelling opportunities, allowing players to explore themes of control, identity, and the fragility of the mind. Whether through magical means, advanced technology, or the mysteries of the psyche, mental damage enriches the complexity and drama of TTRPG encounters.Mental Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn fantasy worlds, mental damage might be inflicted by enchanters, bards, or certain types of clerics who can manipulate emotions or thoughts. Creatures like sirens or harpies might use mesmerizing songs that deal mental damage.Mental Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn futuristic settings, mental damage may come from advanced technologies like “emotion disruptors,” “psychoactive gas,” or even neural hacking that messes with a target’s ability to think or act coherently.Mental Damage in Modern or Urban FantasyHere, mental damage could come from a mix of supernatural beings like fae who toy with emotions, or even human minds with the power to induce fear or confusion. Advanced technologies or potent drugs might also be sources of mental impairment.Mental Damage in HorrorIn a horror context, mental damage is often central to the theme. Encounters with eldritch abominations, ghosts, or demonic entities could impose severe mental tolls. Even merely witnessing certain events or symbols might incur mental damage.Mental Damage in HistoricalWhile rare, mental damage in historical settings could come from curses, extreme forms of religious fervor, or encounters with mythological creatures that can affect the mind. Shamans or mystical traditions might use various methods to inflict this type of damage.Mental Damage in Post-ApocalypticIn the bleak world of post-apocalypse, mental damage could result from the immense stress and horror of daily life, or from mutated creatures with mind-affecting abilities. Lost technology might also play a role, affecting minds in ways no longer fully understood.Mental Damage in SteampunkIn a steampunk world, intricate contraptions like “cogwheel mesmerizers” or “steam-powered emotion regulators” could be designed to manipulate thoughts and feelings, resulting in mental damage. The combination of arcane arts and machinery offers various avenues for such effects.Mystical DamageMystical damage targets the mind, emotions, or soul rather than the physical body. It can manifest as mental fatigue, loss of memory, or even Mystical “pain” that somehow hurts without a physical source. Unlike other damage types, Mystical damage often bypasses traditional forms of armor and physical defense.  Mystical damage offers a different kind of threat, one that can undermine not just a character’s physical health but their mental well-being. It can add an element of existential danger and suspense, making it an interesting option for both players and storytellers alike. Whether through magic, technology, or some unknown force, Mystical damage can make for a complex and intriguing challenge.Mystical Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn fantasy worlds, Mystical damage is often the purview of mystical or arcane powers. Illusionists, mind mages, or psionic beings may use abilities that cause Mystical harm. Certain creatures like mind flayers or elder beings can also deal Mystical damage as part of their eldritch nature.Mystical Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn a science-fiction setting, Mystical damage might be explained through advanced neuroscience, Mystical phenomena, or alien abilities. Weapons like “neural disruptors” or “Mystical amplifiers” could be designed to specifically cause this kind of damage.Mystical Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn contemporary settings, Mystical damage could come from a variety of sources, from cultists invoking ancient powers to induce mental suffering, to modern Mysticals with mysterious abilities. Even cybernetic interfaces could be hacked to deliver a form of Mystical trauma.Mystical Damage in Horror SettingsMystical damage in horror games can be particularly unnerving, as it may target the very core of a character’s sense of self or sanity. Malevolent spirits, cursed objects, or unspeakable entities might wield Mystical abilities as part of their arsenal.Mystical Damage in Historical SettingsWhile rarer in historical settings, Mystical damage could still occur through curses, religious fervor, or esoteric rites. Shamanistic or mystical traditions may involve abilities or artifacts that can inflict harm on the soul or mind.Mystical Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic world, Mystical damage could be a byproduct of the cataclysmic events that shattered civilization. New breeds of mutants, or remnants of old-world technology that affect the mind, could be sources of Mystical damage.Mystical Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk setting, Mystical damage might be caused by experimental “mind-machines” or arcane energies harnessed through intricate devices. Scholars and inventors could dabble in the mysterious realms of the mind, sometimes with dangerous results.Radiant DamageRadiant damage deal with focused forms of light or energy.  The source of this energy differs quite a bit based on the source of that energy. Radiant damage can be associated with divine or celestial power, and is often effective against creatures of darkness or evil. Its origin can also be technological in nature, coming from devices that focus light into damaging beams.  Radiant damage offer unique storytelling opportunities. Radiant damage often carries with it thematic implications of holy retribution or divine intervention, making it a powerful narrative tool. In a technical setting, radiant damage, is often seen as a byproduct of technological advancement and can introduce questions about the ethical use of such powerful weaponry. This damage type can add depth and complexity to combat encounters and offer specialized ways of overcoming challenges.Radiant Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn fantasy settings, radiant damage is often linked to divine beings, holy warriors, or celestial entities. Spells that imbue a weapon with celestial or righteous power, as well as those that unleash divine fury, are common sources of this kind of effect.Radiant Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn science fiction scenarios, laser damage is quite common, appearing in the form of laser guns, laser swords, or even ship-mounted laser cannons. Radiant damage could could also be explained as a form of exotic energy derived from celestial phenomena or advanced technology.Radiant Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsRadiant damage in a modern context could be the result of holy artifacts, divine intervention, or beings of pure light. Experimental weapons or even be weaponized from industrial cutting tools could also be the source of this damage.Radiant Damage in Horror SettingsRadiant damage can serve as a powerful tool for good in a horror setting, damaging vampires, wraiths, or other creatures of the dark. In a sci-fi horror setting radiant damage is a dangerous property where laser weapons are common that can harm both the user and the target if mishandled.Radiant Damage in Historical SettingsRadiant damage in a historical context would likely be tied to religious or mythical narratives, perhaps granted by gods or found in holy relics. If your scenario is an alternative-history setting, technological sources of this damage type might also be present.Radiant Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsRadiant damage sourced from mystical beings and old world religions and cults might be rare. Radiant damage can be found from scavenged technology or the remnants of a more advanced civilizations.Radiant Damage in Steampunk SettingsRadiant damage could be the result of harnessing “aetheric” or “celestial” energy through arcane devices or steam-powered machinery. It can also be a byproduct of new, cutting-edge technology using focused light or energy crystals.Slashing DamageSlashing damage is characterized by cutting, tearing, or slicing actions, often inflicted by edged or bladed weapons. It’s one of the most common damage types and is widely used across various settings and genres. Slashing attacks can be devastatingly effective against lightly-armored targets but may be less effective against heavily-armored or naturally tough creatures.  Slashing damage is a versatile and ubiquitous form of harm that can be found in nearly every TTRPG setting. Whether it’s a knight’s sword or a cybernetic claw, slashing damage offers a wide range of tactical and narrative opportunities. It’s often associated with frontline combatants and melee skirmishes, making it a staple in many adventurers’ repertoires.Slashing Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn a fantasy world, slashing damage is the domain of warriors, barbarians, and swashbucklers wielding swords, axes, and scimitars. Mythical creatures like dragons or manticores might have slashing claws or tails.Slashing Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn futuristic settings, slashing damage may come from high-tech variants like monomolecular blades, plasma swords, or laser-edged weapons.

Supernatural entities might have slashing talons or spectral blades.Slashing Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical scenarios, slashing weapons vary based on the time period and culture, ranging from bronze swords and iron axes to katanas and cavalry sabers. Slashing damage is often the most straightforward and common form of damage in these settings.Slashing Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic world, slashing damage may come from makeshift weapons like jagged pieces of metal or repurposed tools. Resourceful survivors might adapt the remains of the old world into effective slashing weapons.Slashing Damage in Steampunk SettingsSteampunk settings may feature intricately-designed slashing weapons that combine traditional blades with mechanical or arcane enhancements. Gear-driven axes or steam-pressured scimitars add a unique flair to the conventional slashing attack.Social DamageSocial damage is a form of non-physical harm that affects a character’s reputation, relationships, or social standing. While not necessarily quantified in the same way as physical damage, social damage can be just as devastating, impacting a character’s ability to interact, gain resources, or achieve their objectives. This form of damage is most effective in campaigns that place a significant emphasis on social interaction and role-playing.  Social damage offers a different axis of conflict and challenge. It engages players in the complexities of interpersonal relationships and the consequences of their actions in a social context. This type of damage is best employed in campaigns that feature social dynamics as a key component, offering diverse challenges and enriching character development.Social Damage in Fantasy Settings SettingsIn a medieval or fantasy context, social damage could be inflicted through public shaming, accusations of heresy, or tarnishing one’s honor. Nobles might duel not to kill but to humiliate, and bards might sing tales that sow doubt about a hero’s legitimacy.Social Damage in Sci-Fi Settings SettingsIn a futuristic setting, social damage can take on high-tech forms like hacking one’s social profiles, broadcasting disinformation, or using technology to manipulate public opinion. Losing face in a galactic council could have wide-reaching implications.Social Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsSocial damage in a modern setting could involve the spread of damaging rumors online, public humiliation through media, or manipulation of social dynamics. In urban fantasy, magical means like enchantments or illusions could also play a role in social subterfuge.Social Damage in Horror SettingsIn horror settings, social damage could involve stigmatization or ostracization due to perceived ties with supernatural elements. Accusations of witchcraft or being cursed could isolate a character from their community.Social Damage in Historical SettingsIn historical campaigns, social damage often revolves around honor, reputation, and social conventions. Accusations of treachery, disloyalty, or impropriety could ruin lives just as surely as any sword.Social Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn a post-apocalyptic world, social damage might mean being branded a traitor or a thief, leading to exile or worse. In tight-knit communities struggling to survive, social standing can be a matter of life and death.Social Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn steampunk settings, social damage might include being discredited as an inventor, having your patents stolen, or losing favor with influential guilds. Social dynamics can often be just as intricate as any piece of machinery.Sonic DamageSonic damage typically results from intense vibrations in the air, loud noises, or other wave-based forms of energy. This type of damage can affect both the target and the surrounding area, sometimes causing collateral effects like shattering objects or stunning foes. Sonic damage often bypass conventional armor and may have unique interactions with barriers and enclosed spaces.  Sonic damage offer both tactical and narrative richness, capable of bypassing traditional defenses and affecting a broad area. Whether it’s the boom of a magical thunderclap, the whine of an alien sonic emitter, or the roar of a divine beast, this damage type adds depth and excitement to many TTRPG scenarios.Sonic Damage in Fantasy SettingsIn fantastical settings, damage stemming from sound or shockwaves can often be traced back to spells that produce forceful gusts of sonic energy, the abilities of mythical creatures like dragons or banshees, or divine attacks accompanied by an ear-splitting roar.Sonic Damage in Sci-Fi SettingsIn science fiction scenarios, sonic damage could be delivered through advanced weaponry like “sonic disruptors” or “pulse rifles,” or as a byproduct of certain technologies like faster-than-light engines. Even alien creatures might use sonic attacks as a form of communication or hunting.Sonic Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy SettingsIn a modern context, sonic damage could be the product of high-decibel speakers, sonic grenades, or experimental technologies. In urban fantasy, magical creatures or practitioners could use sonic attacks, often hidden behind the guise of natural phenomena like storms.Sonic Damage in Horror SettingsSonic damage add another layer of sensory fright to horror settings. The sudden boom or eerie, escalating hum of a sonic attack can elevate tension. Eldritch beings or cursed artifacts might emit sounds that don’t just scare but also harm.Sonic Damage in Historical SettingsHistorical settings might have more limited sources of sonic or thunder damage, but they could still occur through magical or divine means. For instance, mythological creatures, magical spells, or religious artifacts could produce devastating sonic effects.Sonic Damage in Post-Apocalyptic SettingsIn post-apocalyptic scenarios, remnants of old-world technology might still produce sonic damage, whether it’s malfunctioning military tech or repurposed construction equipment. Mutated creatures might also develop sonic abilities as survival mechanisms.Sonic Damage in Steampunk SettingsIn a steampunk universe, inventors could create complex machinery like “aetheric sound cannons” or “vibration blades” to deal thunder or sonic damage. The merging of arcane and mechanical elements can offer creative ways to deliver these types of effects.Weapon ClassificationsObjects that block higher classes of damage (anti-vehicle, etc… ) will always block all damage from a weapon of a lower class.Vehicle WeaponryThese weapons are built to damage things like ground, air, water, and small spacecraft vehicles at a team, squad, and tactical scale.

Each category has associated modifiers for attack rolls. Attacks can be made beyond the weapons stated range, increase the difficulty. The following traits apply:</p><ul>  <li>    <p><strong>Standard Range</strong>: Attacks made within the weapon’s specified range face no penalties.</p>  </li>  <li><strong>Beyond Range</strong>:    <ul>      <li>For every additional range category beyond the initial one, impose a -2 penalty to the attack roll.</li>      <li>You may attempt an attack one range category beyond the listed maximum, but the attack roll suffers a -3 penalty.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Close Quarters</strong>:    <ul>      <li>Attacking with a ranged weapon while a threatening enemy is within close range (5 feet or less) imposes a disadvantage penalty on your attack roll.</li>      <li>If you are engaged in melee combat and attempt a ranged attack, suffer a -3 penalty.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h4 id=\"loading-\">Loading (#)</h4><p>This property applies to slow-loading weapons like crossbows, black powder firearms, and siege weapons.</p><ol>  <li><strong>Rate of Fire</strong>: You can only fire one piece of ammunition or make a single attack with this weapon per round, irrespective of the number of attacks or actions you have available.</li>  <li><strong>Two-Handed Loading</strong>: It requires both hands to load the weapon, leaving you unable to use other weapons or items while loading.</li>  <li><strong>Loading Time</strong>: The symbol “#” represents the number of actions required to reload the weapon. For instance, Loading (2) means it takes two actions to reload the weapon.</li>  <li><strong>Teamwork</strong>:  For weapons that have enough space to work around that require extensive loading time, multiple characters can contribute actions to speed up the reloading process. Each contributing character must also use both hands to assist in the loading. And each character takes up space around the weapon itself.</li>  <li><strong>Restrictions</strong>:  Firing and reloading this weapon takes precedence over any multi-attack features or abilities you may have. The Loading (#) property restricts you to single attacks per round even if your character normally can attack more frequently.</li></ol><h4 id=\"reload--shots-time\">Reload (## shots, time)</h4><p>This property is for weapons that have a limited ammunition capacity and must be reloaded after expended shots. Unlike weapons with the “Loading (#)” property, these can be fired every round.</p><ol>  <li><strong>Rate of Fire</strong>:  You can fire this weapon every round, assuming it has ammunition remaining. The number represented by “#” indicates the maximum number of shots you can fire before needing to reload.</li>  <li><strong>Two-Handed Reloading</strong>: Reloading this weapon requires both hands, restricting you from using other items or weapons during the reload action.</li>  <li><strong>Reload Time</strong>:  The second number in the parenthesis indicates the time it takes to reload the weapon.</li>  <li><strong>Ammo Count</strong>: Keep track of the number of shots fired. Once you’ve reached the limit indicated by “#,” you must take the required action to reload the weapon before it can be used again.</li>  <li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: While reloading, you cannot perform other actions that require your hands, like casting spells or using another weapon.</li></ol><h4 id=\"aim--rate--reload-from-source-2\">Aim / Rate / Reload from Source 2</h4><p><strong>Aim / Rate  / Reload.</strong> Aim is the number of actions it takes to prepare the weapon for attack.  Formally Aiming a weapon will be determined by class, proficiency and feats.  This number represents the number of actions regardless bonuses from proficiency, feats, or class that it takes to get the weapon ready to attack.</p><p>Rate of Fire is the number of actions it takes to attack with the weapon.  Some weapons may take multiple actions.  Some weapons may allow for multiple attacks per action.</p><p>Reload is the number of actions it takes to reload a ranged weapon.  Please see Weapon Properties on Ammunition and Firearms to further understand this action.</p><h4 id=\"auto-fire\">Auto-Fire</h4><p>For modern and futuristic weapons that can unleash a hail of rounds in seconds. Most automatic weapons can also fire normal single shots. Auto-fire only weapons often have the Brace quality too. There are basically three ways to use auto-fire:</p><ul>  <li>All auto-fire attacks are ranged attack actions made at a -2 penalty.</li></ul><ol>  <li><strong>Single Target Burst</strong>: Maximum range is Short for this attack.</li>  <li><strong>Area Burst</strong>: Affects all targets that are Close to each other (typically a 2 x 2 square). Maximum range is Long for this attack.</li>  <li><strong>Sweep</strong>: Starting at one target and if possible moving to others. Maximum range is Long for this attack.</li></ol><ul>  <li>All uses consume ammunition of 10, (or run out on the numbers rolled listed below if not tracking ammo). – Fix this</li></ul><h4 id=\"double-shot\">Double-Shot</h4><p>This property is for firearms that can fire a couple of shots quickly, such as revolvers and semi-automatic weapons that are not fully automatic. In a Western setting, this is known as Double-Tap.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: Using Double-Shot doubles the amount of normal ammunition needed. If using optional rules for rolling ammunition, it increases the chance of running out by 1 step.</li>  <li><strong>Movement Penalty</strong>: If you move during the same round that you use Double-Shot, you suffer penalties to your attack rolls as specified below.</li>  <li><strong>General</strong>: You can make a Double-Shot as a free action immediately after shooting at a target, to roll a second attack against the same target. If you hit with the second roll, the target takes normal weapon damage. The damage from this second attack is not modified in any way—it is only the damage value listed for the weapon.</li>  <li><strong>Movement Penalties</strong>: Moving incurs a -2 penalty to both attacks.</li></ul><h5 id=\"rules-missing-that-are-needed\">Rules missing that are needed</h5><ul>  <li>Ammo that can not be collected after a battle</li>  <li>Ammo that can be collected and repackaged (brass shells)</li>  <li>Ammo that can be used as an improvised weapon</li></ul><h4 id=\"spray\">Spray</h4><p>This property is for weapons spreads out, increasing the chances of hitting. Often referred to as Grape weapons/shot.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Close Range</strong>: When attacking a target within what is considered “normal” or “close” range for this weapon, players receive a special bonus of a flat +2 to the attack roll.</li>  <li><strong>Beyond Close Range</strong>: When attacking a target beyond this range, the weapon deals half damage. However, the player may choose two targets that are in close proximity to each other to attack simultaneously. The bonus gained at close range does not apply here, but the attack still benefits from the multiple target effect.</li></ul><h4 id=\"flight-path\">Flight Path</h4><p><strong>Round Flight Path</strong>This property applies to specific thrown weapons, denoting a circular flight path for the projectile.</p><ol>  <li><strong>Determining Flight Path</strong>: Establish a circular flight path with the attacker and target on opposite sides of the circle. The distance between them also sets the ‘width’ of the flight path.</li>  <li><strong>Intervening Targets</strong>:  If other creatures or solid objects lie along the flight path, they become the new target.</li>  <li><strong>Hit or Miss</strong>: On a hit, the weapon lands in the target’s space as usual.  On a miss, the weapon continues along the flight path if it is clear; otherwise, it targets the next creature or object in the flight path.</li>  <li><strong>Weapon Return</strong>: If no targets are hit, the weapon returns to the attacker, who can spend a fast/bonus action to catch it. Otherwise, it lands within Close range of the thrower.</li>  <li><strong>Missed Landings</strong>: Subtract the attacker’s attack bonus from the natural roll made for the attack. The result is the number of Close range increments away the weapon lands from the thrower. If the result is zero or less, the weapon returns as described in point 4.</li></ol><h4 id=\"scope--merged-from-source-2\">Scope – Merged from Source 2</h4><p>The weapon has been fitted with vision- enhancing sights, allowing it to put shots on target from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically Extreme Range, so long as the character aims before shooting.</p><h2 id=\"area-effect\">Area Effect</h2><h4 id=\"area-radius\">Area (Radius)</h4><p>These weapons target everyone in the designated radius.</p><ul>  <li>Size of the area determined by weapon’s Radius number.</li>  <li>All targets must be withing this range of all other targets.</li>  <li>Quite often a save/check can reduce the damage of area attacks.</li>  <li>Area attacks typically deal damage even on a miss or if targets make a successful check/save.</li></ul><h4 id=\"blast-from-source-2\">Blast from source 2</h4><p>Upon a hit, Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p><h4 id=\"explosive-x\">Explosive (X)</h4><p>This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will reduce damage in half.</p><h4 id=\"high-explosive-x\">High-Explosive (X)</h4><p>This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will not reduce damage from high-explosive damage.</p><h4 id=\"misfire-from-source-2\">Misfire from Source 2</h4><p>Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapons Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try to repair it.  To repair your firearm , you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8+ misfire score)  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.</p><h2 id=\"melee-weapons-overview\">Melee Weapons Overview</h2><h3 id=\"melee-weapons\">Melee Weapons</h3><p>These weapons are specifically designed for close quarters combat. A weapon of this category has the following traits:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Close Quarters</strong>: Melee weapons are effective within a 5-foot range or less.</li></ul><h3 id=\"armor-penetration---ap-\">Armor Penetration - AP (#)</h3><ul>  <li>This property is for types of weapons that slip through cracks in armor or can pound straight through a simple suit of armor.</li>  <li>This value does not apply against heavily armored vehicles or heavy cover (unless the weapon also has the Anti-Vehicle property).</li>  <li>The AP value is subtracted from the Armor Rating of the defender, if applicable.</li></ul><h3 id=\"awkward-\">Awkward (#)</h3><p>Apply this property to large tools and improvised weapons, especially those that have more than one part that can cause damage, or to weapons that have several moving parts.</p><ul>  <li>A critical fumble or equivalent negative outcome occurs when you roll a number represented by “#” or lower on the attack roll or relevant ability die.</li>  <li>If you roll “#” or lower on your Ability die, reroll the die. If you roll this value again, then it is a critical miss.</li>  <li>Reduce the required number of 1’s by “#”. For example, if typically two 1’s are required for a crit fumble, a weapon with “Awkward 1” would crit fumble with any 1’s showing.</li></ul><h3 id=\"barbed\">Barbed</h3><p>Weapons with barbs and back-ward-facing spikes designed to stick into a target (like a harpoon).</p><ul>  <li>Weapons with this property do their normal damage when they hit.</li>  <li>Weapons with this property remain attached to the target on a hit.</li>  <li>Weapons with this property can be removed by the target, or a creature within Close range of them, by taking an action to remove the weapon with an Average skill check. On a successful result the barbed weapon is removed without damaging the target. On a failure, it is still removed, but the target takes damage again from weapon upon removal.</li>  <li>If the attacker still wields the weapon, they can also remove it as an action. The attacker can chose if the removal will cause additional damage on removal from the target.</li></ul><h3 id=\"brace---merged-from-source-2\">Brace - Merged from Source 2</h3><p>Bracing against the ground doubles damage against charging enemies.</p><h3 id=\"bulky\">Bulky</h3><p>This property is for high-powered weapons that require extra support to wield effectively.</p><ul>  <li>If this weapon is used standing up without a harness, stand or something else to brace with, then you suffer a -2 to your ranged combat skill.</li>  <li>Bulky items count for two encumbrance slots.</li></ul><h3 id=\"brutal---merged-from-source-2\">Brutal - Merged from Source 2</h3><ul>  <li>If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Critical Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is doubled.</li>  <li>If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Serendipitious Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is tripled.</li></ul><h3 id=\"charge-xx---merged-from-source-2\">Charge (XX) - Merged from Source 2</h3><p>When moving at least XX’ in a Ounces (⏱) and attacking doubles any damage done with a successful hit.</p><h3 id=\"crit----skipped-needs-to-look-at\">Crit (#) - Skipped needs to look at</h3><p><strong>At this stage this value only applies to Coriolis games; though I would introduce it to Mutant: Year Zero too, as it is even deadlier</strong>.<br />Where ## equals the amount of extra 6’s required to deal a critical hit following a successful attack.</p><h3 id=\"crushing---merged-from-source-2\">Crushing - Merged from Source 2</h3><p>On a critical hit vs. a target of the attacker’s size or smaller, the attacker can choose to either a) disarm the target, or b) halve the target’s movement rate.</p><p>Certainly, creating rules for damage-over-time effects like Radiation and Fire can add depth and complexity to combat scenarios. Here’s an attempt to create a unified rule for such effects:</p><h3 id=\"damage-over-time-time\">Damage Over Time (Time)</h3><p>Weapons with this property inflict damage over a period of time due to effects like Radiation, Fire, or other lingering hazards. The damage is applied at the start of each affected creature’s turn.</p><ul>  <li>The weapon deals its initial damage upon a successful hit.</li>  <li>The target then takes additional damage equal to half the damage taken last time frame at the start of each time frame until the damage is reduced to zero.</li>  <li>The target can attempt a saving throws per the rules of the game to end the effect early.  A sucessful saving throw cuts the amount of damage done during the next time frame in half.</li></ul><h3 id=\"deadly---merged-from-source-2\">Deadly - Merged from Source 2</h3><p>Roll damage dice with Advantage (roll damage dice twice, and keep the higher result).</p><h3 id=\"defensive-\">Defensive (#)</h3><p>When a weapon has the “Defensive (#)” property, it is designed to block and parry attacks more effectively.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Activation</strong>: The defensive bonus is active as long as you have not used the weapon to attack during your current turn.</li>  <li><strong>Stacking</strong>: When wielding two defensive weapons, only the highest bonus is applied.</li>  <li><strong>General</strong>: Add ## to your defensive value</li></ul><h3 id=\"disarming-rule\">Disarming Rule</h3><p>You need to state you are attempting a disarm before making your attack roll.</p><ul>  <li>Your attack deals half damage.</li>  <li>The target must make a Strength saving throw or equivalent, or drop their weapon. The DC for the saving throw is your attack roll result.</li></ul><h3 id=\"double\">Double</h3><p>A weapon with the “Double” property is essentially two melee weapons joined as one.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Each end retains the properties of the original weapons, except for the Two-handed property.</li>  <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Double weapons require two hands to use but do not have the Two-handed property. They cannot benefit from features that affect two-handed weapons, nor can weapons with the Two-handed property be given the Double property.</li>  <li><strong>Reach</strong>: If the weapon has the Reach property, only one attack per round can benefit from this property.</li>  <li><strong>General</strong>: If a character has the means to fight with two weapons, double weapons qualify. This includes benefits from talents, styles, or features related to two-weapon fighting or light-weapon fighting.</li>  <li><strong>Special Cases</strong>:    <ul>      <li>If both ends have the Light property, the weapon can be used to make a two-weapon fighting attack and benefits from the two-weapon fighting style.</li>      <li>Count as attacking with two weapons.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"entangling\">Entangling</h3><p>This property is for weapons that can ensnare targets, such as nets, or wrap limbs in their embrace, like bolas.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Restrained Condition</strong>: On a hit, the attacker can choose to stop the target from moving (impose the restrained condition) until the target escapes.</li>  <li><strong>Size and Form Limitations</strong>: Targets two size categories larger than the attacker or targets with formless bodies are immune to this property.</li>  <li><strong>Trailing Line</strong>: For weapons with a trailing line, like the whip or harpoon, the target can move but only in the direction of the attacker. If the target remains entangled, the attacker can use their action to initiate a Strength contest and, if successful, can pull the entangled target up to 10 feet towards them.</li>  <li><strong>Escape</strong>: To escape, the target, or another creature within Close range, must spend an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check. The difficulty varies depending on the system.</li>  <li><strong>Destroying the Weapon</strong>: Alternatively, the entangling weapon or its trailing line can be destroyed by dealing it a certain amount of slashing damage. The weapon can only be attacked when it is restraining a target.</li></ul><h3 id=\"fast-toggle-timeframe\">Fast Toggle (Timeframe)</h3><p>Many futuristic and modern weapons have different settings built into a weapon. Changing settings requires that you spend a certain amount of time making the changes.</p><ul>  <li>Changing settings requires a “Timeframe” to be spent toggling the weapon to another configuration.</li></ul><h3 id=\"fast-draw-timeframe\">Fast Draw (Timeframe)</h3><p>Some weapons require that you spend a give time frame getting them ready for use in combat.</p><ul>  <li>Readying this equipment requires a “Timeframe” to be spent setting up the weapon before it can be used.</li></ul><h3 id=\"finesse\">Finesse</h3><p>This property is for light, fast weapons.</p><ul>  <li><strong>General</strong>: When wielding a weapon with the Finesse property, you can substitute a more agile or accurate attribute (like Dexterity, Speed, Accuracy, or Agility) in place of a more strength-oriented attribute (like Strength, Might, Fighting, or Athletics) for the attack bonus and damage die.</li></ul><h3 id=\"fragilescrap\">Fragile/Scrap</h3><p>This property is for weapons made of brittle or less durable materials such as wood, stone, bone, or even metal weapons that are thin or improperly made. These weapons are prone to damage and may require frequent repair.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Reduced Armor Penetration</strong>: All weapons with the Fragile/Scrap property halve any Armor Penetration values they may have, rounded down.</li>  <li><strong>Wear and Tear</strong>: Each time the weapon rolls the minimum damage value, it takes a penalty to its damage rolls. If this penalty accumulates beyond -4, the weapon is considered destroyed.</li>  <li><strong>Repair</strong>:  Someone with the appropriate tools and proficiency can repair the weapon. The time it takes to remove each -1 penalty is one hour per penalty point.</li>  <li><strong>Weapon Longevity</strong>: The threshold before the weapon is destroyed, as well as the means of repair.</li></ul><h3 id=\"gear-bonus--\">Gear Bonus(+/- #)</h3><p><strong>For YZE games only (Coriolis &amp; Mutant: Year Zero)</strong>.<br />Where ## equals the number of gear dice you roll for attacks.</p><h3 id=\"handed-x\">Handed (x)</h3><p>Requires X number of hands; the character cannot use a shield unless they have an additional hand free.</p><h4 id=\"two-handed\">Two-Handed</h4><p>You must use two hands to use these weapons.</p><h3 id=\"heavy\">Heavy</h3><p><strong>Heavy</strong><br />Weapons with this property are cumbersome and difficult to use under certain conditions. They are not well-suited for confined spaces, nor are they easy to wield when mounted. These weapons also prove challenging for smaller creatures.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Mounted or Cramped Conditions</strong>: Using a Heavy weapon while mounted or in cramped conditions imposes penalties of -2 attack rolls.</li>  <li><strong>Size Limitations</strong>: Creatures smaller than the intended size category for the weapon always suffer the imposed penalties.</li>  <li><strong>Off-Hand Restrictions</strong>: Heavy weapons cannot be used in the off-hand.</li>  <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong>:  - Heavy weapons count as two items for the purpose of encumbrance calculations.</li></ul><h3 id=\"knock-out--merged-from-source-2\">Knock-out – Merged from Source 2</h3><p>On a critical hit, the target must save vs. paralysis or be knocked outfor 1d6 turns. The target must be the attacker’s size or smaller, andhave biological susceptibility to being rendered unconscious from blunttrauma to the head.</p><h3 id=\"light\">Light</h3><p><strong>Light</strong><br />Weapons with this property are small, easy to handle, and ideal for quick, agile combat. These weapons are beneficial for characters who prioritize speed and finesse over raw power.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong>:  Light weapons count as half an item for encumbrance purposes. Two light items can fill one line of your Gear/Equipment chart.</li>  <li><strong>Dual Wielding</strong>: When wielding a Light weapon in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make an off-hand attack with another Light weapon. The off-hand attack does not add your ability score to its damage.</li></ul><h3 id=\"mass-produced\">Mass Produced</h3><p>Weapons, ammunition, tools, or armor of this quality are made quickly and with cheaper materials, often by societies that are at higher tech levels then those that introduced the item. A Mass Produced item has the following drawbacks:</p><ul>  <li><strong>-1 to Damage</strong>: Subtracts -1 from all damage rolls made with this weapon. This penalty does stack with magical penalties, if the weapon is or becomes cursed.</li>  <li><strong>-1 to Hit</strong>: Subtracts -1 from all hit rolls made with this weapon. This penalty does stack with magical penalties, if the weapon is or becomes cursed.</li>  <li><strong>No Choice</strong>: The penalties to hit and damage are both automatically applied, and cannot be chosen or mitigated.</li>  <li><strong>Limited Evolution</strong>: Mass Produced items can never become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.</li>  <li><strong>Limited Repairability</strong>: Mass Produced items take twice as long to repair and clean.</li>  <li><strong>High-Tech Mass Production</strong>: A society that is of higher tech levels than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce the item.</li>  <li><strong>Reduced Cost</strong>: Costing half the amount it normally would, representing the economies of scale achieved through high-tech mass production.</li>  <li><strong>Reduced Time</strong>: Creating a mass produced item will take half the normal amount of time.</li>  <li><strong>Bulk Production:</strong> When a mass-produced item is built, the process generates 2 additional items of the same type for the same production cost, representing the efficiency of mass production systems.</li>  <li><strong>Fragile</strong>: Due to cost-cutting measures, the mass-produced item is fragile and more susceptible to breaking.</li></ul><h3 id=\"masterwork-rule\">Masterwork Rule</h3><p>Weapons of this quality are made with exceptional skill and materials. A Masterwork weapon grants the following benefits:</p><ul>  <li><strong>+1 to Damage</strong>: Adds +1 to all damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.</li>  <li><strong>+1 to Hit</strong>: Adds +1 to all hit rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.</li>  <li><strong>Exclusivity</strong>: The person building the masterwork weapon must choose between +1 to hit or +1 to damage, but not both.</li>  <li><strong>Greater Things to Come</strong>: Masterwork items may become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.</li>  <li><strong>Tender Love and Care</strong>: Typically adds an additional 1 month wage for the weapons smith of ₢ of in-game currency to the weapon’s base value.</li></ul><p><strong>Mass Produced.</strong>  A society that is two tech levels higher than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce weapon, ammunition, or armor.  When this is done, the weapon acts like it is fragile as well costing half the amount it costs normally.</p><h3 id=\"operators-rule-\">Operators Rule (#)</h3><p>Weapons in this game may require a specific number of people to operate them effectively, especially in the case of large siege weapons or higher-tech level equipment. The “Operators” characteristic defines this requirement:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Single-Operator</strong>: Weapons with this designation require only one person to operate. These are typically handheld or easily managed weapons.</li>  <li><strong>Multi-Operator</strong>: Weapons with this designation require more than one person to operate successfully. The specific number needed will be listed alongside the weapon’s description. For example, a trebuchet might list “Operators: 3” to indicate that it requires three people for optimal use.</li>  <li><strong>Tech-Dependent</strong>: Higher-tech level weapons may require a larger operating crew due to their complexity.

Whether it’s a vial of acid thrown by an alchemist, a dragon’s acidic breath, or an environmental hazard, acid damage brings a sense of relentless, unstoppable dissolution to the table.  Acid damage can be highly varied and tailored to fit the mood, technology level, and general theme of your campaign, making it a versatile and evocative tool in a game master’s arsenal.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-fantasy-settings\">Acid Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4><p>In a classic fantasy realm, acid damage might come from a variety of sources. Potions or flasks of acid could be commonly sold in arcane shops or used by tricky rogues. Some creatures, like black dragons or oozes, are well-known for their acid-based attacks. Wizards and sorcerers may also have spells at their disposal that conjure acidic clouds or bolts.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-sci-fi-settings\">Acid Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4><p>In science fiction campaigns, acid damage could be delivered via specially designed weapons that shoot corrosive substances, or it could be an environmental hazard on an alien planet. Acid might also be used as a weapon of mass destruction, capable of melting through spaceship hulls or robotic exteriors.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Acid Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>Imagine running into a criminal gang that employs acid as a weapon, or perhaps a creature of myth hiding in the city sewers with corrosive saliva. Acid might also be a hazardous material in a chemical plant, providing a mundane but dangerous obstacle for players to navigate.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-horror-settings\">Acid Damage in Horror Settings</h4><p>In horror settings, acid could be a particularly gruesome way to showcase the terror of a scene. Whether it’s an acidic trap set up by a malevolent entity or a creature whose touch dissolves flesh, acid damage can heighten the stakes and horror.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-historical-settings\">Acid Damage in Historical Settings</h4><p>Whether it’s the ancient world or a more recent setting, acid could be employed in a number of ways, from primitive corrosive substances used in traps to more modern scientific applications. In war settings, acid could be used as a primitive form of chemical warfare.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings\">Acid Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4><p>In a world where resources are scarce, acid might become a highly sought-after weapon. It could be harvested from mutated creatures or manufactured in rudimentary labs. Traps using acid could also be a common way to protect valuable resources.</p><h4 id=\"acid-damage-in-steampunk-settings\">Acid Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4><p>Acid in a steampunk setting might come from elaborate brass and glass contraptions that spray the substance, or it could be part of the exhaust from a steam-powered machine gone haywire.</p><h3 id=\"bludgeoning-damage\">Bludgeoning Damage</h3><p>Bludgeoning damage is the most straightforward and one of the most versatile types of damage, representing impact force against a target. This could be from a club, a falling rock, or a giant’s fist. It’s a primal and direct form of damage that lends itself to all sorts of contexts and settings.  Bludgeoning damage is a universal concept that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or genre. It’s a fundamental form of harm that resonates on a basic level, making it a versatile choice for all kinds of storytelling scenarios.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-fantasy-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4><p>Bludgeoning is perhaps most commonly seen in fantasy settings, where weapons like hammers, maces, and staves are abundant. Monsters like hill giants or trolls may use large clubs or even their fists to deal bludgeoning damage. Traps in ancient temples might release rolling boulders, and magic spells could call down meteor showers.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-sci-fi-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4><p>In a science fiction context, bludgeoning damage could come from advanced, but non-lethal crowd-control weapons designed to subdue rather than kill. It could also be the result of a spaceship crash or a mechanical arm gone rogue. Even in high-tech settings, the simplicity of bludgeoning means it’s never obsolete.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>In modern settings, bludgeoning damage often takes on a gritty, street-level quality. It might come from baseball bats in a gang fight, or rubber bullets used by riot police. In urban fantasy, mystical beings might employ ancient hammers or other legendary blunt instruments that carry both physical and magical weight.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-horror-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Horror Settings</h4><p>In horror games, bludgeoning is the staple of many a terrifying foe. Whether it’s a crazed killer with a sledgehammer or an undead monstrosity with overwhelming strength, bludgeoning damage in horror is often portrayed as brutal and gruesome.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-historical-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Historical Settings</h4><p>In historical campaigns, the technology and weaponry might define the types of bludgeoning damage encountered. In a Roman campaign, it could be the wooden clubs of barbarians, while in medieval Japan it could be the bo staff or kanabo (a spiked or studded two-handed club).</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4><p>In post-apocalyptic worlds, bludgeoning takes on a makeshift quality. Makeshift weapons like crowbars, tire irons, or even simple rocks become essential tools for survival. Bludgeoning damage here is raw and desperate, emblematic of the harshness of life in a ruined world.</p><h4 id=\"bludgeoning-damage-in-steampunk-settings\">Bludgeoning Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4><p>In a steampunk universe, expect to see elaborate mechanical hammers, pneumatic fists, or even steam-powered mauls. These often combine the aesthetic of the setting with the primal effectiveness of bludgeoning damage.</p><h3 id=\"cold-damage\">Cold Damage</h3><p>Cold damage represents harm inflicted through extremely low temperatures, freezing winds, or ice-based magical or elemental attacks. It’s a damage type that often has the added effect of slowing down or immobilizing targets, making it a tactical option in various settings.  Cold damage offers a versatile and often tactical form of harm that can be adapted to any setting. It can be a straightforward combat concern, an environmental obstacle, or a mood-setting element, making it a useful addition to any game master’s repertoire.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-fantasy-settings\">Cold Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4><p>In a fantasy world, cold damage might come from ice dragons, frost mages, or enchanted weapons imbued with chilling magic. The wilderness itself, particularly tundra or icy mountain ranges, can be a source of environmental cold damage.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-sci-fi-settings\">Cold Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4><p>In a futuristic or space-faring campaign, cold damage could be inflicted by advanced cryo-weapons or malfunctioning life support systems in a spaceship. Planets with harsh, sub-zero climates may also serve as environments where cold damage is a constant concern.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Cold Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>In a modern setting, cold damage might stem from liquid nitrogen traps or experimental cold-based weaponry. In urban fantasy, perhaps a being from Norse mythology brings with it a frigid aura, or a rogue scientist has developed a freeze ray that’s causing havoc.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-horror-settings\">Cold Damage in Horror Settings</h4><p>Cold damage in a horror setting adds an element of dread and creeping doom. It might manifest through malevolent spirits that bring a chill to the air, or a dark ritual that plummets the temperature in an area, slowing characters both physically and mentally.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-historical-settings\">Cold Damage in Historical Settings</h4><p>In historical settings, cold damage is often an environmental concern. For example, expeditions into the Arctic or soldiers on winter campaigns could face the dangers of frostbite and hypothermia, which could be represented as cold damage in game terms.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings\">Cold Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4><p>In a post-apocalyptic setting, the collapse of modern infrastructure might mean a harsh winter presents a significant danger. Alternatively, some apocalyptic event might have thrown the climate into chaos, making cold damage a frequent concern.</p><h4 id=\"cold-damage-in-steampunk-settings\">Cold Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4><p>In steampunk settings, imaginative devices like “Frost Cannons” or “Icy Ether Projectors” could be sources of cold damage. Inventors and scientists may have devised various ways to weaponize cold, adding a touch of Victorian flair to the elemental force.</p><h3 id=\"fire-damage\">Fire Damage</h3><p>Fire damage is a classic and evocative form of harm, symbolizing both destruction and cleansing. Whether it comes from a dragon’s breath, a Molotov cocktail, or a high-tech flamethrower, fire damage often comes with the added complication of potentially spreading or affecting an area.  Fire damage is a dramatic and multi-faceted form of harm that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or storyline. It’s both a practical combat concern and a powerful thematic element, making it a useful and engaging tool in any game master’s toolkit.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-fantasy-settings\">Fire Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4><p>Fire is a staple in fantasy settings, and it manifests in myriad ways. Wizards might launch fireballs, while warriors could wield flaming swords. Red dragons, fire elementals, and various demonic creatures often deal fire damage. Magical traps that erupt in flame are also common in ancient dungeons.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-sci-fi-settings\">Fire Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4><p>In science fiction, fire damage could come from advanced energy weapons that emulate the effect of fire on a molecular level. Flamethrowers and incendiary rounds can cause fire damage, as could the dangerous environment of an alien planet with methane lakes that can ignite.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Fire Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>Modern settings offer a variety of sources for fire damage, from Molotov cocktails thrown in a street protest to arson attacks. In urban fantasy, ancient artifacts might conjure fire, or magical creatures like phoenixes might bring their own fiery destruction to the modern world.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-horror-settings\">Fire Damage in Horror Settings</h4><p>Fire often serves as a dual symbol in horror settings: a destroyer and a purifier. It could be that the only way to vanquish an undead abomination is to set it aflame, or perhaps a malevolent spirit sets lethal fires. Either way, fire damage in horror can be both a threat and a tool for players.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-historical-settings\">Fire Damage in Historical Settings</h4><p>In a historical setting, fire damage can come from a variety of sources depending on the time period. In ancient sieges, flaming arrows and pots of burning oil were used. In more recent times, the advent of firearms and artillery brought explosive rounds that could cause fire damage.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings\">Fire Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4><p>In post-apocalyptic worlds, fire is often a primal force again, necessary for survival but also a constant hazard. Makeshift weapons like flaming arrows or fuel-filled bottles become more common, and the destruction of modern firefighting methods might make fire damage more pervasive and dangerous.</p><h4 id=\"fire-damage-in-steampunk-settings\">Fire Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4><p>In a steampunk universe, expect to see fantastical contraptions that shoot jets of flame or incendiary rounds. Fire may also be a byproduct of the many steam-powered machines that populate the world, making it a common environmental hazard.</p><h3 id=\"force-damage\">Force Damage</h3><p>Force damage is a unique and often magical form of energy that bypasses most forms of physical resistance. It represents a pure, raw exertion of energy, often manifested as invisible or ethereal blasts, barriers, or waves. This type of damage is commonly associated with arcane or divine sources but can also occur due to technological means in certain settings.  Force damage is a versatile and often mysterious form of harm that can appear in a wide array of settings. It’s typically less straightforward than physical types of damage, offering a range of creative and tactical possibilities that can add depth and intrigue to any campaign.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-fantasy-settings-settings\">Force Damage in Fantasy Settings Settings</h4><p>In a fantasy realm, force damage is often the purview of arcane spellcasters. Spells that shoot bolts of arcane energy or generate waves of concussive force may have the capability to inflict force damage. Certain enchanted items or artifacts may also deliver force damage when activated.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-sci-fi-settings-settings\">Force Damage in Sci-Fi Settings Settings</h4><p>In science fiction worlds, force damage could be related to advanced technology like force fields, gravity-manipulating devices, or particle beams. It could also come from psionic abilities, where mental force is made manifest to damage or repel enemies.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Force Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>In modern or urban fantasy settings, force damage could manifest through esoteric martial arts that focus energy, or through technological means like experimental weapons. It might also come from powerful artifacts hidden in plain sight, like a seemingly innocuous pendant that unleashes a burst of force energy when activated.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-horror-settings\">Force Damage in Horror Settings</h4><p>In a horror game, force damage could be associated with malevolent spirits or curses that exert a damaging influence on the physical world. It could also manifest as an extension of forbidden arcane or eldritch knowledge, hurting those who dare to meddle with the unknown.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-historical-settings\">Force Damage in Historical Settings</h4><p>In historical settings, force damage might be limited to legendary artifacts, divine interventions, or other extraordinary circumstances. For example, a holy relic could emit a burst of force energy when used to fend off unholy creatures.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings\">Force Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4><p>In post-apocalyptic scenarios, remnants of advanced technology or lost arcane knowledge might be the sources of force damage. A scavenged piece of tech or a rediscovered spellbook could provide characters with a unique advantage.</p><h4 id=\"force-damage-in-steampunk-settings\">Force Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4><p>In a steampunk world, experimental “force cannons” or “aetheric pulse devices” might deliver bursts of concentrated force. These could be the inventions of mad scientists, or perhaps based on arcane principles rediscovered and mechanized through steampunk ingenuity.</p><h3 id=\"electrical-damage\">Electrical Damage</h3><ul>  <li>Fire: target of a fire attack may continue to burn (use the fire rules for the system being used).  &lt;– this needs to change</li>  <li>Ion: this damages electronics and droids only.</li></ul><p>Electrical damage represents the raw power of electricity or other types of intense energy. Whether it’s a bolt of lightning from the sky, an electrical trap, or a futuristic laser, this damage type is often fast, focused, and devastating. It can also carry the additional effect of disrupting systems, whether those are magical constructs or technological devices.  Electrical damage is a flexible and dynamic type of harm that can find a place in almost any kind of setting.

This can give a vital edge in combat while an enemy ship recovers or force an enemy to surrender before the disabling attack is followed up by something far more potent.</p>  <p>Instead of dealing damage as usual, Ion weapons use the following rules.</p>  <blockquote>    <p>When an Ion weapon successfully hits a target, roll for its damage but ignore any armour the target possesses. Instead of applying damage to the target’s hull, it is instead temporarily deducted from the target’s Power, representing the disabling effects as they spread throughout the ship and the crew working hard to keep the most vital systems online.</p>    <p>This reduction in Power will last until the target completes its next set of actions, in either the current Ounces (⏱) or the next.</p>    <p>If the Effect of the attack roll is 6 or more, the reduction in Power will last for D3 rounds.</p>  </blockquote></blockquote><h4 id=\"electrical-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings\">Electrical Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4><p>Electricity is a modern marvel, and in contemporary settings, it might be weaponized in the form of tasers, electrical traps, or experimental energy weapons.

            "content_text": "The phrase “Art of the Possible” evokes a sense of visionary capability, of realizing potentials that may not yet be fully recognized. Tracing its etymology, the term finds its roots not in the realm of vision or innovation, but in the world of politics and bureaucracy. Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian statesman of the 19th century, said, “Politics is the art of the possible.” In this context, Bismarck emphasized the importance of pragmatism in politics; understanding the limitations and potentials of a situation and acting accordingly, even if it means compromising one’s ideals, achieving very little, and maintaining the status quo.Over time, this phrase transcended its origin in the bureaucracy, morphing into a broader ideology employed across fields from business strategy to technological to scientific innovation. It underscores a seemingly wise principle: while one might envision an ideal or perfect solution, it’s crucial to navigate the complexities and limitations of our reality, seeking solutions that, while perhaps not perfect, are feasible and effective. This notion of optimizing within constraints, at first glance, appears grounded in realism and foresight.But it is not always the approach one needs to take. Approaches to change vary based on context, objective, and desired outcomes. Operational changes focus on improving existing processes and systems, optimizing them for better efficiency. Meanwhile, evolutionary changes are gradual shifts that occur over time, naturally adapting and progressing as situations demand. This form of change is more organic, responding to the ebbs and flows of societal, technological, or organizational needs.  These types of change are typically incremental shifts, enhancing what is already in place, and this is the perfect place for the “Art of the Possible.” In contrast, transformational changes are more radical, aiming to overhaul existing paradigms entirely, ushering in a new era of practices, systems, or beliefs. Such changes are often disruptive but can lead to revolutionary outcomes.  There’s also the realm of revolutionary change, which, unlike its evolutionary counterpart, seeks rapid and profound shifts, pushing boundaries and often risking failure to achieve groundbreaking results.The Tyranny of the “Possible” and the Downfall of True IdealismThe modern age, with its breakthroughs and boundless horizons, seems like a fertile ground for expansive thinking and audacious ventures. Yet, there’s a creeping sentiment that threatens to clip our wings because this ideology implies that we must resign ourselves to what is immediately feasible, sacrificing the extraordinary at the altar of the ordinary. Underneath this veneer of practical wisdom lies a pernicious acceptance of mediocrity.The Mirage of PragmatismAt a glance, pragmatism might appear to be the rational choice. After all, isn’t it wiser to navigate the world as it is, rather than how we wish it to be? But this viewpoint, championed by the “art of the possible,” is a siren’s song. It lures us with promises of immediate results and straightforward paths, only to trap us in a quagmire of compromise. Rather than sparking innovation and fostering true progress, this brand of pragmatism quashes it, demanding that we abandon our loftiest dreams for the sake of short-term gains.The danger here is twofold. Firstly, by prioritizing the possible over the ideal, we limit our potential. Great achievements in history—be it in science, art, or social change—were rarely born from a mindset of moderation. Secondly, this perspective cultivates an environment where settling becomes the norm. Instead of challenging barriers and pushing boundaries, we’re told to work within them.This virus, one caught, doesn’t merely delay progress; it actively hampers it. When we constantly aim for what’s immediately achievable, we lose sight of what’s on the horizon.  It’s on that horizon where you find groundbreaking innovations.  The longer this approach lasts the smaller and smaller the horizon becomes.  Eventually those groundbreaking innovations have receded beyond the horizon.Engineering and Design: The Corporation That Makes and Markets a ProductConsider the realm of large companies, global enterprises, and multi-national value chains where visionaries dream to reshaping their futures, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and crafting systems that stand as testaments to human ingenuity. But the chains of the “possible” shackle them to the ground. They find themselves proud of their bureaucracy, complaining about their conditions without changing them, admiring the problems, living with institutional inertia, kicking the can on outdated systems, using continuously changing band-aided solutions that never seem to address systemic issues, all because of an acceptance of existing paradigms.  The final step is to succumb to the thought that the difficult is impossible.Art and Science: The Duel of Creation and InquiryBoth art and science, in their purest forms, are driven by boundless imagination. Art becomes a realm where the soul takes flight, leading to the creation of tales, paintings, and sculptures that resonate deeply with human emotion. Science, on the other hand, propels the mind on voyages of discovery, free from the constraints of present knowledge, giving birth to revolutionary theories and groundbreaking experiments. Yet, in both fields, there exists a restrictive sentiment: the “art of the possible” in creativity and the “science of the possible” in inquiry. These sentiments urge artists and scientists to conform to prevailing trends, tastes, methodologies, or funding avenues.This confinement has repercussions. When artists and scientists yield to these external pressures, the authenticity of their work diminishes. Art may still be technically accomplished, but it risks losing its genuine passion and soul. Similarly, research might uphold established methodologies, but it could lack the profound vision and depth that come with unrestricted curiosity. By tethering artistic and scientific endeavors to what’s trendy, immediately sellable, or fundable, we risk reducing these profound human pursuits to mere commodities and routines.From Novice to Mastery: The Journey Beyond the “Art of the Possible”Beginning the journey in any field often starts with the “art of the possible.” But don’t get fooled; at a glance, it appears as a promising doctrine, offering a consistent, albeit gradual, trajectory towards competence without the dread of setbacks. This approach can indeed transition someone from being aware of a subject to having a grasp of it to the extent they can do something with that subject. However, this doctrine isn’t an avenue to true mastery, but rather a path to moderate proficiency. Cloaked in the guise of sagacity, the “art of the possible” only takes you as far as competence, stopping far short of excellence.Achieving unparalleled expertise demands more. It calls for challenging the established norms, pushing boundaries, and at times, braving colossal failures.

            "summary": "<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n",
            
            "content_text": "IntroductionWelcome to the Märchen Engine, your guide to the core rules of this Gaming System. This introduction gives you a snapshot of what the Märchen Engine entails and how it functions. As you delve into the subsequent chapters, you’ll learn how to craft characters and set out on thrilling adventures of your own.What Is Roleplaying?If you are new to roleplaying, you might be asking yourself, “What is a roleplaying game?”In a roleplaying game (RPG) or table top role playing game (TTRPG), you step into the shoes of a character in a fictional world. You’re responsible for bringing this character to life, either through actual role-playing or through a series of structured decisions and character growth. The outcomes of your actions are determined by a set of formal rules and guidelines, like those found in the Märchen Engine.When you play in a session of The Märchen Engine game unfolds through conversation. One of you takes on the role of the Referee, who not only interprets the rules but also sets the stage for the game’s world. The rest of you each control a single character. Together with the Referee, you all weave a narrative. It’s akin to the imaginative games of make-believe you might have played as a child, but now with the added elements of dice and structure.What Is the Märchen Engine?The Märchen Engine serves as your guidebook for navigating games rooted in classic fiction and adventure tales. Within its pages, you’ll discover guidelines for crafting characters, tackling challenges, combating creatures, dabbling in speculative trading, venturing into unexplored realms, and much more. While no rulebook can cover every scenario, the Märchen Engine aims to equip you with enough tools to craft nearly any adventure you can imagine.Drawing inspiration from the early days of roleplaying and classic fiction, the Märchen Engine shares many similarities with those vintage gaming systems. You’ll find that materials from older rule sets and those generated under the Märchen Engine can easily mesh together, requiring only minimal adjustments.To get started, you’ll need a few essentials: a copy of the Märchen Engine rules, a set of dice—available at any game or hobby store (at a minimum, you’ll need four eight-sided dice)—and some pencil and paper for note-taking, map-drawing, and sketching. Above all, bring your imagination and a willingness to share your creative ideas with others. That’s the most important ingredient for a memorable gaming experience.Iconography⚅ - Dice Modifier - When you see this symbol, it’s telling you how to adjust your dice roll. For instance, ⚅-3 means you’ll subtract three from whatever you roll for that particular situation. On the flip side, ⚅+2 means you’ll add two to your roll. Don’t be fooled by the six-sided die image; it’s just a general indicator for a dice roll and doesn’t specify the type of die you should use.Dice Symbolsσ – The lower-case Sigma symbol signals that you’ve rolled the dice and are now categorizing the outcome. Your result will fall within a range from -4 to +4.± % – This symbol, plus or minus a percentage, comes into play after you’ve rolled the dice. You’ll categorize the result, which will be a percentage ranging from 400% down to 25%. Often, this modifies the time duration or profit of a transaction, depending on the skills you used to resolve the situation.Time Symbols🌍 - Annually. For you, this means something occurring or taking a year.🌱 - Seasonal. You experience events or activities that last a season.🌙 - Monthly / One Moon. In your life, things happen on a monthly basis or in sync with the lunar cycle, from full moon to full moon. A month is 4 weeks.🔄 - Weekly. You find that some tasks or events occur every week. This is traditionally equivalent to a quarter of a month.☀️ - Daily. In your culture, the day may start at sundown or sunrise. Regardless, some activities take a day to complete or occur daily.⌚ - Watch of 4 hours. In your professional environments, the Watch is used to allocate work among teams. Some tasks may take a watch to finish, or they occur within each watch.⏳ - This symbol represents an hour. Some tasks will take an hour, and some events happen hourly.🔔 - This symbolizes 30 minutes. In various contexts, such as military or city life, bells ring on the hour and half-hour, helping communities coordinate tasks.⏱ - A moment, which is 90 seconds or (¹/₄₀) of an hour, represents “now” or being in the moment for you and most people in general.⚡ - The lightning bolt symbolizes a Once, a Round, or a Combat round, each lasting 7.5 seconds, historically defined as a twelfth (¹/₁₂) of a moment. This is as fast as people can conceive things happening.👁️ - You can even break down Onces into “Atoms of time,” which are (¹/₄₇) of a Once. This measurement accounts for the time it takes for an eye to twinkle, hence the phrase “In the twinkling of an eye.” Some events can interrupt Once actions, and they all occur in Atom time, with no specific order but guided by what’s most awesome for the overall story, as decided by the Referee.Skill Symbols▩ = Skilled - Skilled. Contributes to Total.☒ = Damaged - Skilled, but Damaged. Does not contribute to Total.  Damaged skills can still be used to determine if an object is usable.▣ = Competent - Experienced, but not skilled. Does not contribute to Total.  Some objects require formal training to use successfully, competent skills can not be used to determine if an object is usable.▢ = Unskilled - You have no Experience and you are not Skilled. Does not contribute to Total.The Basic AssumptionsYou and your fellow players are united in your quest for enjoyment, driven by a mutual goal to deepen your friendships and build stronger bonds with others. While this collective aim might not be explicitly stated, its influence is unmistakable. The core of your endeavors is rooted in kindness, integrity, and a communal spirit. The obstacles you face come in the forms of selfishness, discord, and arrogance. Each decision you make in support of these values is inherently noble, reinforcing the principles you hold dear.Have FunIn the realm of pen &amp; paper roleplaying games, your primary aim is to experience joy and bring entertainment to your circle of friends. Keep in mind that tabletop RPGs are designed as a communal pastime, meant to be relished with your companions, and at the end of the day, it’s all in the spirit of play. Different circles might lean towards various styles—be it the thrill of strategic battles or the allure of personal narratives and storytelling—but the foundational ethos stays the same: relish the fun. When challenges crop up, a good number of them can be sorted out by applying simple logic and focusing on what makes these games so captivating. Consider this both from your vantage point as a participant and through the lens of the Referee. In the end, the objective is for everyone involved, yourself included, to have an exceptional time and fully immerse in the experience.Fun for PlayersAs a participant in tabletop RPGs, you find joy in a variety of elements that collectively make the game enjoyable. Three major factors typically influence your level of satisfaction: the challenge difficulty, your character’s personal motivations, and the tangible effects of your actions on the game world.The degree of challenge in overcoming obstacles can significantly contribute to your sense of achievement. Striking the right balance is key; too easy, and the challenges may seem inconsequential, but too hard can lead to frustration. If the Referee is uncertain, it’s generally better to err on the side of easier challenges to maintain the game’s flow and keep the story engaging.Tying the main plot to your character’s backstory is vital for keeping you engaged. When the story’s goals, like rescuing a kidnapped person, are intertwined with elements of your character’s life—perhaps a dear family member or close friend—the stakes and emotional involvement elevate. The story’s outcome directly affects your character, deepening your connection and investment in the game world.The consequences of your actions should be evident and meaningful within the game setting. For instance, a quest to vanquish a rampaging beast should have a well-thought-out aftermath, reflecting your success or failure. This could range from showing the devastation left by the creature to villagers celebrating your heroism. Seeing the real-world impact of your choices enhances your sense of agency and the story’s dynamism.These are just a few crucial aspects to keep in mind as you navigate the world of tabletop RPGs.Fun for Referees?As a Referee, you find your enjoyment in various ways, each contributing to the overall satisfaction of running the game.One of the most rewarding aspects for you is seeing the immediate reactions and feedback from your players, both during and after the session. Observing their expressions of excitement or apprehension serves as a fulfilling payoff for all the effort and planning you’ve put into the game.Your creative process is another wellspring of joy. The act of designing the game, predicting player moves, and incorporating immersive elements like handouts, props, and music all contribute to your sense of creative fulfillment. When you finally unveil your carefully crafted session to the players, the anticipation heightens your own excitement. Acknowledgment and praise for your hard work are vital; they fuel your motivation to continue crafting compelling narratives. Your gaming experience actually begins well before the dice hit the table, during the preparation phase. Receiving positive feedback for this effort enables you to tailor future sessions in ways that are rewarding for both you and your players.When Referees are having a hard timeAs a Referee, you might encounter moments where preparing for sessions starts to feel more like a chore than a pleasure. When this happens, stepping back from the game or engaging with a new group can be refreshing. Broadening your horizons by interacting with other role-playing enthusiasts—perhaps through conventions or RPG-focused podcasts—can offer fresh perspectives and inspiration for future quests.When the group’s enjoyment starts to wane, it’s essential to seek feedback from both players and fellow Referees. Your players can provide valuable insights into what’s affecting the fun factor, and their input can guide you in enhancing the gaming experience. Conversing with other Referees, whether in person or through online forums, can offer additional advice and support, helping you navigate challenges.Handling players who put their own enjoyment above the group’s can be a delicate issue. It’s crucial to address this directly with the individual involved, even if it risks straining relationships. Open, honest conversations can often defuse tension and lead to a more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.Stay in CommunicationTo sidestep common pitfalls in gaming groups, effective communication is key for you. Don’t hold back from voicing concerns due to worries about confrontation or hurting feelings. Silence only allows frustrations to accumulate, potentially leading to heated, unintended clashes. Instead, tackle issues head-on and maturely. If there’s an aspect of the game you’re not enjoying, bring it up openly with your fellow players. Keep in mind that everyone may have different expectations, and these diverging views can make someone feel left out. The solution often lies in open dialogue.Recognize that disagreements and constructive feedback don’t make anyone a bad person. Foster a communicative environment by offering positive reinforcement when someone’s actions improve your gaming experience. Don’t hesitate to share your ideas, pose questions, and express any concerns about where the game is headed. Since collaborative storytelling is the essence of role-playing, engaging in discussions about the story’s development with both your fellow players and the Referee is crucial.Embrace DiversityIn the world of role-playing games, it’s essential for you to celebrate diversity and address any discrepancies in playstyles. If the game leans heavily towards combat and treasure hunting, but you’re more interested in deep role-playing and character arcs, don’t hesitate to talk to your fellow players. They might be willing to include more role-playing aspects if they know it’s something you’d enjoy. The Referee, too, may be focusing on a hack-and-slash style for simplicity but could easily pivot to more character-driven storytelling if that’s what the players want. Again, open communication is your best tool.If you find that the group’s interests are firmly rooted in combat-centric gameplay, you’re faced with two choices: either adjust your expectations to enjoy the combat-focused sessions or think about exiting the game. It’s not fair to expect the group to shift their playstyle solely for your benefit. Loyalty to your friends shouldn’t compel you to stick with an activity that doesn’t make you happy. Exiting the game doesn’t mean you’re abandoning your friendships; there are plenty of other ways to spend quality time together. If your decision to leave causes tension within your circle, it might be time to reassess the dynamics of those friendships.Value Others’ TimeConsistency is key in role-playing games, especially for storytelling, and this applies to you as well. When you’re late or can’t make it to a session, it creates hurdles for both the Referee and your fellow players. They’re left with the task of either accounting for your character’s absence or playing your role for you. If your character is pivotal to the storyline or the group is small, it might be best to delay the game until everyone can be present. Unless you have a compelling reason, make it a point to arrive on time. If you’re going to be late or can’t attend, inform the group as soon as you can so they can adjust their plans.If you foresee regular tardiness or absences due to work or other obligations, it’s crucial to let the group know at the outset. Early communication allows them to strategize how to handle your character’s absence and enables the Referee to tailor the game to your availability. This ensures that any scenarios requiring your character’s specific skills or knowledge can be managed effectively.Even if you have a busy schedule and important commitments, modern communication tools make it simple to stay in touch. There are few acceptable reasons for leaving your group in the dark about your whereabouts. Remember, your fellow players also have their own commitments and would rather not spend their time waiting on you.Stay EngagedIn storytelling, protagonists rarely just go with the flow; they take charge, make plans, and confront challenges head-on. Your RPG character should embody this proactive spirit as well. Since RPGs aren’t scripted, your role goes beyond just ensuring your character does intriguing things. You also have the unique chance to influence the game world and narrative. This could mean introducing new characters, pursuing individual goals that diverge from the main storyline, or even aiding the Referee in world-building and scene-setting. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to enrich both your character and the game world. If an idea strikes you, speak up. The worst that can happen is the Referee saying “No,” but the best-case scenario could add a memorable twist to the adventure.Share the SpotlightWhile it’s important for you to play your character as a hero in an RPG, never forget that you’re part of a collaborative ensemble, not a solo act. Your character will undoubtedly have moments to shine, especially if you’re an active participant. However, there will also be times when other characters take the lead. It’s crucial for you to recognize when it’s your turn to step back and let others have their moment in the spotlight. In situations where your character is the focal point or when no one is specifically featured, be mindful not to hog the Referee’s attention. Instead, look for ways to involve other characters. Start in-character dialogues, formulate plans that leverage their unique abilities, offer comedic relief, or do anything else that allows your fellow players to be more than mere spectators to your monologues.Keep the Game FlowingWhile RPGs can hit snags for a variety of reasons—be it story complexities, rule ambiguities, or simple distractions—the Referee isn’t solely responsible for keeping things on track; you can help too. Remember, you’re there to engage in the game, so try to limit off-topic conversations and socializing that could derail the narrative. If you have anecdotes, jokes, or unrelated questions, share them at suitable moments and keep them brief to maintain the game’s flow. Stay involved even when your character isn’t the focus, so you don’t require constant catch-ups from your fellow players.It’s beneficial for you to have a basic grasp of the game’s rules and setting, particularly as they relate to your character. While it’s okay to ask questions for clarification, make an effort to stay attentive and understand what’s happening. Consider making a cheat sheet or taking notes to help you remember key details. If you know you’ll need to refer to a rulebook, bookmark the relevant pages ahead of time.If a scene starts to lag, especially if your character is central to it, take the initiative to move things along. Avoid getting bogged down in rule disputes during the game; instead, voice your concerns respectfully and abide by the Referee’s decision. Detailed discussions about rules can be saved for after the game. If everyone agrees on a better interpretation, it can be implemented in future sessions. Generally, the initial ruling won’t have a major impact, so it’s best to keep the game moving.Be a Gracious GuestOne rule that’s sometimes forgotten but is crucial for you to remember is to be mindful of your host, whether you’re playing at someone’s house or a public venue like a local gaming store. If you want snacks or drinks during the game, it’s a good idea to bring your own. Your host is already offering the space for you to play; it’s not their responsibility to also provide refreshments. Before engaging in activities like smoking, vaping, or impromptu musical numbers, make sure everyone is comfortable with it.Be especially considerate if there are others around who aren’t part of the game, such as family members of the host or customers and staff in a store. Keep your behavior polite and avoid actions that could be disruptive or annoying to them. And before you head out, take a few moments to clean up your gaming area. Dispose of any trash and aim to leave the space as clean—if not cleaner—than you found it.The Core Task Resolution SystemIn the Märchen Engine, a core task resolution system is in place to determine the outcomes of your character’s actions. Whenever your character tries to do something where failure is a possibility, follow these steps:      Roll the dice, the type and number of which are dictated by your character’s attributes and the situation at hand.        Add any applicable modifiers to the roll. These could be related to your character’s skills, traits, the task’s difficulty, or specific circumstances.        Compare the final result to the success threshold. If your roll equals or surpasses this number, your action is successful. If it falls short, the action fails.  This straightforward system is the backbone for almost every action in the Märchen Engine. The specifics may vary based on the modifiers you add to your roll and the consequences of either succeeding or failing at the task.RefereeIn the Märchen Engine framework, one player is designated to take on the role of the Referee. This individual serves multiple functions: they are the organizer, the go-to authority for rule-related queries, the arbitrator of disputes, and the moderator for either a single Märchen Engine session or an ongoing campaign. Your role as the Referee is to knit together the narratives of the other players’ characters, manage all non-player elements of the game, craft settings where players can engage with each other, and resolve any conflicts that may arise among players.CharactersIn the The Märchen Enginere are two main categories of heroes: Player Characters (PCs) and Non-Player Characters (NPCs). A Player Character is a fictional figure within the Märchen Engine universe whose actions are directly steered by a human player, rather than being dictated by the game’s rules. On the other hand, Non-Player Characters are those not controlled by any of the players. The behavior and actions of these NPCs are usually managed by the Referee.Player CharactersIn the Märchen Engine, players craft a Hero that embodies the role they wish to play in the game, using the game’s rules as a framework. Typically, the Hero belongs to a specific race, which is determined by the options available within the Referee’s universe. Additionally, each Hero boasts a unique set of skills and varying levels of expertise in those skills. This customization allows players to create characters that are not only distinct but also aligned with their vision for their role in the game.Associates, PCs, HeroesIn the context of the Märchen Engine, terms like Associates, PCs (Player Characters), and Heroes are used to describe other characters who are part of your adventure but are not controlled by the Referee. These characters are managed by other human players and accompany you on your journey, each contributing their unique skills and attributes to the collective quest.The CompanyYour group of characters comes together through shared interests or goals. These could be short-term objectives set by authority figures or a collective desire to explore the world for the first time.After you and your fellow players have crafted your characters, discuss with the Referee the circumstances that united your group into a team of adventurers. The more detailed you are about the events that set you all on this path, the better. This gives the Referee valuable hooks for creating adventures that tie directly into your characters’ backgrounds.The act of forming your team is the first activity you’ll engage in as a group. During this team-creation phase, the Referee assists you in defining the unique traits that characterize your band of adventurers.SanctuarySanctuaries serve as unique locations specifically designed to meet the needs of your team of adventurers, complete with a host who is willing to welcome you. At the start of the game, there’s only one location that you can already consider a sanctuary. As you progress through character creation and gameplay, you’ll encounter various characters who will unlock additional sanctuaries specifically for you and your fellow players.PatronA patron is typically a well-known or influential individual who occasionally provides your team with a reason to go on adventures, often offering support and advice as well. If you’re in the same location as a potential patron and they’re available, you and your companions can choose to meet with them during your seasonal activities.Your team can have multiple patrons simultaneously, provided you meet the criteria to secure their loyalty. More often than not, patrons will expect something in return for their support and friendship.First MeetingThe first step is to determine where your team of adventurers was formed. To do this, you and your fellow players pick a suitable location. Sanctuaries are often ideal choices, as they are known to be welcoming and are frequently connected to influential patrons. Once everyone agrees on a location, make sure to note its name on your individual character sheets.Next, each player briefly introduces their character, highlighting how and why they ended up at the chosen location. Your characters’ cultural backgrounds and vocations can serve as useful starting points for this discussion. The Referee might use this time to offer additional context about the game world, especially for players who are less familiar with it. Some locations are particularly well-suited for your team’s initial gathering.The objective for your first season is to hold this inaugural meeting. After that, you’ll either focus on tasks assigned by your patron—if your first meeting took place in a sanctuary—or journey to your first sanctuary to meet your patron.RelationshipsWhile all adventurers in your group share a sense of loyalty toward one another, each of you can form a unique bond with another member. This could be a deep respect for someone who is wiser or more noble, a special friendship with an old friend, a sense of kinship with someone from the same background, or a deep affection for a family member.Whatever the nature of this relationship, you must choose another member of your team to be your character’s focus. Write down the name of this individual in the designated area on your character sheet. This focus can be any other Associate, Companion, or Patron within the group, even if someone else has already chosen them as their focus. Keep in mind that these bonds don’t have to be mutual. If another character chooses you as their focus, you’re still free to select anyone else as your own.RatingYour team of adventurers is more than just a random assembly of mercenaries united by circumstance. At the core of your group are shared objectives and a mutual respect for one another. This sense of unity is represented in the game through a communal pool of Company points. Throughout the game, you and your teammates can use these points to heal Mystical and Social Damage.The initial number of Company points available to your group is equal to the total number of heroes in the team. Make sure to record this total in the designated area on your character sheet. This score will be updated each time a team member uses a point for recovery. It’s important to note that the pool of Company points is fully replenished at the start of each new game session.Other CharactersAs you progress through your adventures, you’ll find that your character forms both friendships and rivalries, establishing connections with various non-player characters who may become significant in future quests. These relationships fall into four distinct categories, each with its own implications and potential impacts on your journey.CompanionA Companion is a character who joins you on your adventures but is not controlled by another human player. Instead, the Referee takes on the role of managing these Companions. Family members or spouses are common examples of Companions that many heroes are likely to have in their lives. These characters can add depth to your story and potentially play crucial roles in your adventures.AlliesAllies are are individuals that you, as the Hero, know and have had friendly dealings with in the past. They possess valuable skills, positions, or assets and are willing to assist you, and will go out of their way to offer their support.ContactsContacts are similar to Allies but are more inclined to actively assist you in your endeavors. They can offer various forms of support, from providing information to lending resources or skills that can help you on your quests.It’s worth noting that both Allies and Contacts can also serve as Patrons, offering not just assistance but potentially guiding your adventures with specific tasks and objectives. These relationships add layers of complexity and opportunity to your journey.RivalsRivals are individuals who harbor animosity or opposition toward you. They will actively seek to disrupt your plans, interfere with your objectives, or even harass you throughout your adventures. These characters add tension and challenges to your journey, serving as obstacles you must navigate or confront.EnemiesEnemies are a step beyond Rivals in terms of hostility. While a Rival may operate within the bounds of the law to compete with or obstruct you, an Enemy has far more malicious intentions. They aim for your ultimate downfall, whether that means seeing you dead, imprisoned, or otherwise facing dire circumstances. These characters introduce high stakes and imminent threats to your adventure, requiring you to be ever vigilant and strategic.HirelingsHirelings come in three main types, each serving a different role in your adventures:      Mercenaries: These are your standard hired soldiers, typically employed for conventional military tasks like guarding a location or attacking enemy strongholds. They usually work as part of a larger force.        Retainers: These NPCs are either brave or foolhardy enough to be paid for accompanying you on the perilous adventures that you love to undertake.        Specialists: These are experts in specific non-combat or combat-adjacent fields, such as tradesmen, armorers, or alchemists.  All hirelings come with basic equipment suitable for their profession, subject to the Referee’s discretion. For instance, a light infantryman might have leather armor, a shield, and a short sword or spear. An armorer or alchemist would come with their respective tools. You, as the employer, would be responsible for providing any heavy or specialized equipment, like a forge or laboratory.To bring these NPCs into your service, you’ll need to negotiate terms with them. The Referee will usually handle this by role-playing the prospective hireling, using dice rolls to determine outcomes, or most likely, a combination of both role-play and dice.MercenariesMercenaries are individuals trained for combat, whether as formal soldiers or as hired muscle. Their tasks can range from guarding and patrolling to launching assaults on enemy strongholds or engaging in combat with opposing forces. They might even be employed to ambush unsuspecting travelers. However, don’t expect them to join you on high-risk, perilous adventures like plundering haunted tombs or infiltrating enemy castles for assassination missions. Those kinds of tasks are beyond what they’re willing to do for their usual pay. They’re soldiers, not daredevils.RetainersRetainers are NPCs who are willing to go the extra mile for you, serving as bodyguards, henchmen, or sidekicks. Unlike mercenaries, they’re loyal enough to follow you into dangerous situations and may operate individually rather than as part of a larger force. However, their loyalty comes at a cost: they require a higher monthly fee and expect a share of any treasure you acquire during your adventures.You can have multiple retainers, but you must be able to afford them. The higher your Emotional strength and Leadership skills, the more retainers you can effectively manage. Regardless of your emotional strength, you’ll always be able to have at least one retainer.The Referee will generate potential retainers as regular characters, using the standard character generation rules. This is always subject to the Referee’s discretion. Retainers come equipped with basic gear, either from their initial character generation or purchased with money they earned in their previous career.SpecialistsSpecialists are tradesmen or professionals hired for specific non-combat tasks, like sailors to crew a ship or an alchemist to concoct potions. While they’re generally non-combatants, this can vary depending on the Referee’s discretion and the particular job they’ve been hired for. For instance, siege engineers are usually considered combatants, even though they’d expect to stay out of immediate danger.The payment for a Specialist is determined by their specific skills and competencies. So, if you’re looking to hire someone with a unique set of skills, be prepared to negotiate a fee that reflects their expertise.",
            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to the <strong><em>Märchen Engine</em></strong>, your guide to the core rules of this Gaming System. This introduction gives you a snapshot of what the Märchen Engine entails and how it functions. As you delve into the subsequent chapters, you’ll learn how to craft characters and set out on thrilling adventures of your own.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-roleplaying\">What Is Roleplaying?</h2><p>If you are new to roleplaying, you might be asking yourself, “What is a roleplaying game?”</p><p>In a roleplaying game (RPG) or table top role playing game (TTRPG), you step into the shoes of a character in a fictional world. You’re responsible for bringing this character to life, either through actual role-playing or through a series of structured decisions and character growth. The outcomes of your actions are determined by a set of formal rules and guidelines, like those found in the Märchen Engine.</p><p>When you play in a session of The Märchen Engine game unfolds through conversation. One of you takes on the role of the Referee, who not only interprets the rules but also sets the stage for the game’s world. The rest of you each control a single character. Together with the Referee, you all weave a narrative. It’s akin to the imaginative games of make-believe you might have played as a child, but now with the added elements of dice and structure.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-märchen-engine\">What Is the Märchen Engine?</h2><p>The Märchen Engine serves as your guidebook for navigating games rooted in classic fiction and adventure tales. Within its pages, you’ll discover guidelines for crafting characters, tackling challenges, combating creatures, dabbling in speculative trading, venturing into unexplored realms, and much more. While no rulebook can cover every scenario, the Märchen Engine aims to equip you with enough tools to craft nearly any adventure you can imagine.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from the early days of roleplaying and classic fiction, the Märchen Engine shares many similarities with those vintage gaming systems. You’ll find that materials from older rule sets and those generated under the Märchen Engine can easily mesh together, requiring only minimal adjustments.</p><p>To get started, you’ll need a few essentials: a copy of the Märchen Engine rules, a set of dice—available at any game or hobby store (at a minimum, you’ll need four eight-sided dice)—and some pencil and paper for note-taking, map-drawing, and sketching. Above all, bring your imagination and a willingness to share your creative ideas with others. That’s the most important ingredient for a memorable gaming experience.</p><h2 id=\"iconography\">Iconography</h2><p>⚅ - Dice Modifier - When you see this symbol, it’s telling you how to adjust your dice roll. For instance, ⚅-3 means you’ll subtract three from whatever you roll for that particular situation. On the flip side, ⚅+2 means you’ll add two to your roll. Don’t be fooled by the six-sided die image; it’s just a general indicator for a dice roll and doesn’t specify the type of die you should use.</p><h3 id=\"dice-symbols\">Dice Symbols</h3><p>σ – The lower-case Sigma symbol signals that you’ve rolled the dice and are now categorizing the outcome. Your result will fall within a range from -4 to +4.</p><p>± % – This symbol, plus or minus a percentage, comes into play after you’ve rolled the dice. You’ll categorize the result, which will be a percentage ranging from 400% down to 25%. Often, this modifies the time duration or profit of a transaction, depending on the skills you used to resolve the situation.</p><h3 id=\"time-symbols\">Time Symbols</h3><p>🌍 - Annually. For you, this means something occurring or taking a year.</p><p>🌱 - Seasonal. You experience events or activities that last a season.</p><p>🌙 - Monthly / One Moon. In your life, things happen on a monthly basis or in sync with the lunar cycle, from full moon to full moon. A month is 4 weeks.</p><p>🔄 - Weekly. You find that some tasks or events occur every week. This is traditionally equivalent to a quarter of a month.</p><p>☀️ - Daily. In your culture, the day may start at sundown or sunrise. Regardless, some activities take a day to complete or occur daily.</p><p>⌚ - Watch of 4 hours. In your professional environments, the Watch is used to allocate work among teams. Some tasks may take a watch to finish, or they occur within each watch.</p><p>⏳ - This symbol represents an hour. Some tasks will take an hour, and some events happen hourly.</p><p>🔔 - This symbolizes 30 minutes. In various contexts, such as military or city life, bells ring on the hour and half-hour, helping communities coordinate tasks.</p><p>⏱ - A moment, which is 90 seconds or (¹/₄₀) of an hour, represents “now” or being in the moment for you and most people in general.</p><p>⚡ - The lightning bolt symbolizes a Once, a Round, or a Combat round, each lasting 7.5 seconds, historically defined as a twelfth (¹/₁₂) of a moment. This is as fast as people can conceive things happening.</p><p>👁️ - You can even break down Onces into “Atoms of time,” which are (¹/₄₇) of a Once. This measurement accounts for the time it takes for an eye to twinkle, hence the phrase “In the twinkling of an eye.” Some events can interrupt Once actions, and they all occur in Atom time, with no specific order but guided by what’s most awesome for the overall story, as decided by the Referee.</p><h3 id=\"skill-symbols\">Skill Symbols</h3><p>▩ = Skilled - Skilled. Contributes to Total.</p><p>☒ = Damaged - Skilled, but Damaged. Does not contribute to Total.  Damaged skills can still be used to determine if an object is usable.</p><p>▣ = Competent - Experienced, but not skilled. Does not contribute to Total.  Some objects require formal training to use successfully, competent skills can not be used to determine if an object is usable.</p><p>▢ = Unskilled - You have no Experience and you are not Skilled. Does not contribute to Total.</p><h2 id=\"the-basic-assumptions\">The Basic Assumptions</h2><p>You and your fellow players are united in your quest for enjoyment, driven by a mutual goal to deepen your friendships and build stronger bonds with others. While this collective aim might not be explicitly stated, its influence is unmistakable. The core of your endeavors is rooted in kindness, integrity, and a communal spirit. The obstacles you face come in the forms of selfishness, discord, and arrogance. Each decision you make in support of these values is inherently noble, reinforcing the principles you hold dear.</p><h3 id=\"have-fun\">Have Fun</h3><p>In the realm of pen &amp; paper roleplaying games, your primary aim is to experience joy and bring entertainment to your circle of friends. Keep in mind that tabletop RPGs are designed as a communal pastime, meant to be relished with your companions, and at the end of the day, it’s all in the spirit of play. Different circles might lean towards various styles—be it the thrill of strategic battles or the allure of personal narratives and storytelling—but the foundational ethos stays the same: relish the fun. When challenges crop up, a good number of them can be sorted out by applying simple logic and focusing on what makes these games so captivating. Consider this both from your vantage point as a participant and through the lens of the Referee. In the end, the objective is for everyone involved, yourself included, to have an exceptional time and fully immerse in the experience.</p><h4 id=\"fun-for-players\">Fun for Players</h4><p>As a participant in tabletop RPGs, you find joy in a variety of elements that collectively make the game enjoyable. Three major factors typically influence your level of satisfaction: the challenge difficulty, your character’s personal motivations, and the tangible effects of your actions on the game world.</p><p>The degree of challenge in overcoming obstacles can significantly contribute to your sense of achievement. Striking the right balance is key; too easy, and the challenges may seem inconsequential, but too hard can lead to frustration. If the Referee is uncertain, it’s generally better to err on the side of easier challenges to maintain the game’s flow and keep the story engaging.</p><p>Tying the main plot to your character’s backstory is vital for keeping you engaged. When the story’s goals, like rescuing a kidnapped person, are intertwined with elements of your character’s life—perhaps a dear family member or close friend—the stakes and emotional involvement elevate. The story’s outcome directly affects your character, deepening your connection and investment in the game world.</p><p>The consequences of your actions should be evident and meaningful within the game setting. For instance, a quest to vanquish a rampaging beast should have a well-thought-out aftermath, reflecting your success or failure. This could range from showing the devastation left by the creature to villagers celebrating your heroism. Seeing the real-world impact of your choices enhances your sense of agency and the story’s dynamism.</p><p>These are just a few crucial aspects to keep in mind as you navigate the world of tabletop RPGs.</p><h4 id=\"fun-for-referees\">Fun for Referees?</h4><p>As a Referee, you find your enjoyment in various ways, each contributing to the overall satisfaction of running the game.</p><p>One of the most rewarding aspects for you is seeing the immediate reactions and feedback from your players, both during and after the session. Observing their expressions of excitement or apprehension serves as a fulfilling payoff for all the effort and planning you’ve put into the game.</p><p>Your creative process is another wellspring of joy. The act of designing the game, predicting player moves, and incorporating immersive elements like handouts, props, and music all contribute to your sense of creative fulfillment. When you finally unveil your carefully crafted session to the players, the anticipation heightens your own excitement. Acknowledgment and praise for your hard work are vital; they fuel your motivation to continue crafting compelling narratives. Your gaming experience actually begins well before the dice hit the table, during the preparation phase. Receiving positive feedback for this effort enables you to tailor future sessions in ways that are rewarding for both you and your players.</p><h4 id=\"when-referees-are-having-a-hard-time\">When Referees are having a hard time</h4><p>As a Referee, you might encounter moments where preparing for sessions starts to feel more like a chore than a pleasure. When this happens, stepping back from the game or engaging with a new group can be refreshing. Broadening your horizons by interacting with other role-playing enthusiasts—perhaps through conventions or RPG-focused podcasts—can offer fresh perspectives and inspiration for future quests.</p><p>When the group’s enjoyment starts to wane, it’s essential to seek feedback from both players and fellow Referees. Your players can provide valuable insights into what’s affecting the fun factor, and their input can guide you in enhancing the gaming experience. Conversing with other Referees, whether in person or through online forums, can offer additional advice and support, helping you navigate challenges.</p><p>Handling players who put their own enjoyment above the group’s can be a delicate issue. It’s crucial to address this directly with the individual involved, even if it risks straining relationships. Open, honest conversations can often defuse tension and lead to a more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.</p><h3 id=\"stay-in-communication\">Stay in Communication</h3><p>To sidestep common pitfalls in gaming groups, effective communication is key for you. Don’t hold back from voicing concerns due to worries about confrontation or hurting feelings. Silence only allows frustrations to accumulate, potentially leading to heated, unintended clashes. Instead, tackle issues head-on and maturely. If there’s an aspect of the game you’re not enjoying, bring it up openly with your fellow players. Keep in mind that everyone may have different expectations, and these diverging views can make someone feel left out. The solution often lies in open dialogue.</p><p>Recognize that disagreements and constructive feedback don’t make anyone a bad person. Foster a communicative environment by offering positive reinforcement when someone’s actions improve your gaming experience. Don’t hesitate to share your ideas, pose questions, and express any concerns about where the game is headed. Since collaborative storytelling is the essence of role-playing, engaging in discussions about the story’s development with both your fellow players and the Referee is crucial.</p><h3 id=\"embrace-diversity\">Embrace Diversity</h3><p>In the world of role-playing games, it’s essential for you to celebrate diversity and address any discrepancies in playstyles. If the game leans heavily towards combat and treasure hunting, but you’re more interested in deep role-playing and character arcs, don’t hesitate to talk to your fellow players. They might be willing to include more role-playing aspects if they know it’s something you’d enjoy. The Referee, too, may be focusing on a hack-and-slash style for simplicity but could easily pivot to more character-driven storytelling if that’s what the players want. Again, open communication is your best tool.</p><p>If you find that the group’s interests are firmly rooted in combat-centric gameplay, you’re faced with two choices: either adjust your expectations to enjoy the combat-focused sessions or think about exiting the game. It’s not fair to expect the group to shift their playstyle solely for your benefit. Loyalty to your friends shouldn’t compel you to stick with an activity that doesn’t make you happy. Exiting the game doesn’t mean you’re abandoning your friendships; there are plenty of other ways to spend quality time together. If your decision to leave causes tension within your circle, it might be time to reassess the dynamics of those friendships.</p><h3 id=\"value-others-time\">Value Others’ Time</h3><p>Consistency is key in role-playing games, especially for storytelling, and this applies to you as well. When you’re late or can’t make it to a session, it creates hurdles for both the Referee and your fellow players. They’re left with the task of either accounting for your character’s absence or playing your role for you. If your character is pivotal to the storyline or the group is small, it might be best to delay the game until everyone can be present. Unless you have a compelling reason, make it a point to arrive on time. If you’re going to be late or can’t attend, inform the group as soon as you can so they can adjust their plans.</p><p>If you foresee regular tardiness or absences due to work or other obligations, it’s crucial to let the group know at the outset. Early communication allows them to strategize how to handle your character’s absence and enables the Referee to tailor the game to your availability. This ensures that any scenarios requiring your character’s specific skills or knowledge can be managed effectively.</p><p>Even if you have a busy schedule and important commitments, modern communication tools make it simple to stay in touch. There are few acceptable reasons for leaving your group in the dark about your whereabouts. Remember, your fellow players also have their own commitments and would rather not spend their time waiting on you.</p><h3 id=\"stay-engaged\">Stay Engaged</h3><p>In storytelling, protagonists rarely just go with the flow; they take charge, make plans, and confront challenges head-on. Your RPG character should embody this proactive spirit as well. Since RPGs aren’t scripted, your role goes beyond just ensuring your character does intriguing things. You also have the unique chance to influence the game world and narrative. This could mean introducing new characters, pursuing individual goals that diverge from the main storyline, or even aiding the Referee in world-building and scene-setting. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to enrich both your character and the game world. If an idea strikes you, speak up. The worst that can happen is the Referee saying “No,” but the best-case scenario could add a memorable twist to the adventure.</p><h3 id=\"share-the-spotlight\">Share the Spotlight</h3><p>While it’s important for you to play your character as a hero in an RPG, never forget that you’re part of a collaborative ensemble, not a solo act. Your character will undoubtedly have moments to shine, especially if you’re an active participant. However, there will also be times when other characters take the lead. It’s crucial for you to recognize when it’s your turn to step back and let others have their moment in the spotlight. In situations where your character is the focal point or when no one is specifically featured, be mindful not to hog the Referee’s attention. Instead, look for ways to involve other characters. Start in-character dialogues, formulate plans that leverage their unique abilities, offer comedic relief, or do anything else that allows your fellow players to be more than mere spectators to your monologues.</p><h3 id=\"keep-the-game-flowing\">Keep the Game Flowing</h3><p>While RPGs can hit snags for a variety of reasons—be it story complexities, rule ambiguities, or simple distractions—the Referee isn’t solely responsible for keeping things on track; you can help too. Remember, you’re there to engage in the game, so try to limit off-topic conversations and socializing that could derail the narrative. If you have anecdotes, jokes, or unrelated questions, share them at suitable moments and keep them brief to maintain the game’s flow. Stay involved even when your character isn’t the focus, so you don’t require constant catch-ups from your fellow players.</p><p>It’s beneficial for you to have a basic grasp of the game’s rules and setting, particularly as they relate to your character. While it’s okay to ask questions for clarification, make an effort to stay attentive and understand what’s happening. Consider making a cheat sheet or taking notes to help you remember key details. If you know you’ll need to refer to a rulebook, bookmark the relevant pages ahead of time.</p><p>If a scene starts to lag, especially if your character is central to it, take the initiative to move things along. Avoid getting bogged down in rule disputes during the game; instead, voice your concerns respectfully and abide by the Referee’s decision. Detailed discussions about rules can be saved for after the game. If everyone agrees on a better interpretation, it can be implemented in future sessions. Generally, the initial ruling won’t have a major impact, so it’s best to keep the game moving.</p><h3 id=\"be-a-gracious-guest\">Be a Gracious Guest</h3><p>One rule that’s sometimes forgotten but is crucial for you to remember is to be mindful of your host, whether you’re playing at someone’s house or a public venue like a local gaming store. If you want snacks or drinks during the game, it’s a good idea to bring your own. Your host is already offering the space for you to play; it’s not their responsibility to also provide refreshments. Before engaging in activities like smoking, vaping, or impromptu musical numbers, make sure everyone is comfortable with it.</p><p>Be especially considerate if there are others around who aren’t part of the game, such as family members of the host or customers and staff in a store. Keep your behavior polite and avoid actions that could be disruptive or annoying to them. And before you head out, take a few moments to clean up your gaming area. Dispose of any trash and aim to leave the space as clean—if not cleaner—than you found it.</p><h2 id=\"the-core-task-resolution-system\">The Core Task Resolution System</h2><p>In the Märchen Engine, a core task resolution system is in place to determine the outcomes of your character’s actions. Whenever your character tries to do something where failure is a possibility, follow these steps:</p><ol>  <li>    <p>Roll the dice, the type and number of which are dictated by your character’s attributes and the situation at hand.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Add any applicable modifiers to the roll. These could be related to your character’s skills, traits, the task’s difficulty, or specific circumstances.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Compare the final result to the success threshold. If your roll equals or surpasses this number, your action is successful. If it falls short, the action fails.</p>  </li></ol><p>This straightforward system is the backbone for almost every action in the Märchen Engine. The specifics may vary based on the modifiers you add to your roll and the consequences of either succeeding or failing at the task.</p><h2 id=\"referee\">Referee</h2><p>In the Märchen Engine framework, one player is designated to take on the role of the Referee. This individual serves multiple functions: they are the organizer, the go-to authority for rule-related queries, the arbitrator of disputes, and the moderator for either a single Märchen Engine session or an ongoing campaign. Your role as the Referee is to knit together the narratives of the other players’ characters, manage all non-player elements of the game, craft settings where players can engage with each other, and resolve any conflicts that may arise among players.</p><h2 id=\"characters\">Characters</h2><p>In the The Märchen Enginere are two main categories of heroes: Player Characters (PCs) and Non-Player Characters (NPCs). A Player Character is a fictional figure within the Märchen Engine universe whose actions are directly steered by a human player, rather than being dictated by the game’s rules. On the other hand, Non-Player Characters are those not controlled by any of the players. The behavior and actions of these NPCs are usually managed by the Referee.</p><h3 id=\"player-characters\">Player Characters</h3><p>In the Märchen Engine, players craft a Hero that embodies the role they wish to play in the game, using the game’s rules as a framework. Typically, the Hero belongs to a specific race, which is determined by the options available within the Referee’s universe. Additionally, each Hero boasts a unique set of skills and varying levels of expertise in those skills. This customization allows players to create characters that are not only distinct but also aligned with their vision for their role in the game.</p><h4 id=\"associates-pcs-heroes\">Associates, PCs, Heroes</h4><p>In the context of the Märchen Engine, terms like Associates, PCs (Player Characters), and Heroes are used to describe other characters who are part of your adventure but are not controlled by the Referee. These characters are managed by other human players and accompany you on your journey, each contributing their unique skills and attributes to the collective quest.</p><h3 id=\"the-company\">The Company</h3><p>Your group of characters comes together through shared interests or goals. These could be short-term objectives set by authority figures or a collective desire to explore the world for the first time.</p><p>After you and your fellow players have crafted your characters, discuss with the Referee the circumstances that united your group into a team of adventurers. The more detailed you are about the events that set you all on this path, the better. This gives the Referee valuable hooks for creating adventures that tie directly into your characters’ backgrounds.</p><p>The act of forming your team is the first activity you’ll engage in as a group. During this team-creation phase, the Referee assists you in defining the unique traits that characterize your band of adventurers.</p><h4 id=\"sanctuary\">Sanctuary</h4><p>Sanctuaries serve as unique locations specifically designed to meet the needs of your team of adventurers, complete with a host who is willing to welcome you. At the start of the game, there’s only one location that you can already consider a sanctuary. As you progress through character creation and gameplay, you’ll encounter various characters who will unlock additional sanctuaries specifically for you and your fellow players.</p><h4 id=\"patron\">Patron</h4><p>A patron is typically a well-known or influential individual who occasionally provides your team with a reason to go on adventures, often offering support and advice as well. If you’re in the same location as a potential patron and they’re available, you and your companions can choose to meet with them during your seasonal activities.</p><p>Your team can have multiple patrons simultaneously, provided you meet the criteria to secure their loyalty. More often than not, patrons will expect something in return for their support and friendship.</p><h4 id=\"first-meeting\">First Meeting</h4><p>The first step is to determine where your team of adventurers was formed. To do this, you and your fellow players pick a suitable location. Sanctuaries are often ideal choices, as they are known to be welcoming and are frequently connected to influential patrons. Once everyone agrees on a location, make sure to note its name on your individual character sheets.</p><p>Next, each player briefly introduces their character, highlighting how and why they ended up at the chosen location. Your characters’ cultural backgrounds and vocations can serve as useful starting points for this discussion. The Referee might use this time to offer additional context about the game world, especially for players who are less familiar with it. Some locations are particularly well-suited for your team’s initial gathering.</p><p>The objective for your first season is to hold this inaugural meeting. After that, you’ll either focus on tasks assigned by your patron—if your first meeting took place in a sanctuary—or journey to your first sanctuary to meet your patron.</p><h4 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h4><p>While all adventurers in your group share a sense of loyalty toward one another, each of you can form a unique bond with another member. This could be a deep respect for someone who is wiser or more noble, a special friendship with an old friend, a sense of kinship with someone from the same background, or a deep affection for a family member.</p><p>Whatever the nature of this relationship, you must choose another member of your team to be your character’s focus. Write down the name of this individual in the designated area on your character sheet. This focus can be any other Associate, Companion, or Patron within the group, even if someone else has already chosen them as their focus. Keep in mind that these bonds don’t have to be mutual. If another character chooses you as their focus, you’re still free to select anyone else as your own.</p><h4 id=\"rating\">Rating</h4><p>Your team of adventurers is more than just a random assembly of mercenaries united by circumstance. At the core of your group are shared objectives and a mutual respect for one another. This sense of unity is represented in the game through a communal pool of Company points. Throughout the game, you and your teammates can use these points to heal Mystical and Social Damage.</p><p>The initial number of Company points available to your group is equal to the total number of heroes in the team. Make sure to record this total in the designated area on your character sheet. This score will be updated each time a team member uses a point for recovery. It’s important to note that the pool of Company points is fully replenished at the start of each new game session.</p><h3 id=\"other-characters\">Other Characters</h3><p>As you progress through your adventures, you’ll find that your character forms both friendships and rivalries, establishing connections with various non-player characters who may become significant in future quests. These relationships fall into four distinct categories, each with its own implications and potential impacts on your journey.</p><h4 id=\"companion\">Companion</h4><p>A Companion is a character who joins you on your adventures but is not controlled by another human player. Instead, the Referee takes on the role of managing these Companions. Family members or spouses are common examples of Companions that many heroes are likely to have in their lives. These characters can add depth to your story and potentially play crucial roles in your adventures.</p><h4 id=\"allies\">Allies</h4><p>Allies are are individuals that you, as the Hero, know and have had friendly dealings with in the past. They possess valuable skills, positions, or assets and are willing to assist you, and will go out of their way to offer their support.</p><h4 id=\"contacts\">Contacts</h4><p>Contacts are similar to Allies but are more inclined to actively assist you in your endeavors. They can offer various forms of support, from providing information to lending resources or skills that can help you on your quests.</p><p>It’s worth noting that both Allies and Contacts can also serve as Patrons, offering not just assistance but potentially guiding your adventures with specific tasks and objectives. These relationships add layers of complexity and opportunity to your journey.</p><h4 id=\"rivals\">Rivals</h4><p>Rivals are individuals who harbor animosity or opposition toward you. They will actively seek to disrupt your plans, interfere with your objectives, or even harass you throughout your adventures. These characters add tension and challenges to your journey, serving as obstacles you must navigate or confront.</p><h4 id=\"enemies\">Enemies</h4><p>Enemies are a step beyond Rivals in terms of hostility. While a Rival may operate within the bounds of the law to compete with or obstruct you, an Enemy has far more malicious intentions. They aim for your ultimate downfall, whether that means seeing you dead, imprisoned, or otherwise facing dire circumstances. These characters introduce high stakes and imminent threats to your adventure, requiring you to be ever vigilant and strategic.</p><h4 id=\"hirelings\">Hirelings</h4><p>Hirelings come in three main types, each serving a different role in your adventures:</p><ol>  <li>    <p><strong>Mercenaries</strong>: These are your standard hired soldiers, typically employed for conventional military tasks like guarding a location or attacking enemy strongholds. They usually work as part of a larger force.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p><strong>Retainers</strong>: These NPCs are either brave or foolhardy enough to be paid for accompanying you on the perilous adventures that you love to undertake.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p><strong>Specialists</strong>: These are experts in specific non-combat or combat-adjacent fields, such as tradesmen, armorers, or alchemists.</p>  </li></ol><p>All hirelings come with basic equipment suitable for their profession, subject to the Referee’s discretion. For instance, a light infantryman might have leather armor, a shield, and a short sword or spear. An armorer or alchemist would come with their respective tools. You, as the employer, would be responsible for providing any heavy or specialized equipment, like a forge or laboratory.</p><p>To bring these NPCs into your service, you’ll need to negotiate terms with them. The Referee will usually handle this by role-playing the prospective hireling, using dice rolls to determine outcomes, or most likely, a combination of both role-play and dice.</p><h5 id=\"mercenaries\">Mercenaries</h5><p>Mercenaries are individuals trained for combat, whether as formal soldiers or as hired muscle. Their tasks can range from guarding and patrolling to launching assaults on enemy strongholds or engaging in combat with opposing forces. They might even be employed to ambush unsuspecting travelers. However, don’t expect them to join you on high-risk, perilous adventures like plundering haunted tombs or infiltrating enemy castles for assassination missions. Those kinds of tasks are beyond what they’re willing to do for their usual pay. They’re soldiers, not daredevils.</p><h5 id=\"retainers\">Retainers</h5><p>Retainers are NPCs who are willing to go the extra mile for you, serving as bodyguards, henchmen, or sidekicks. Unlike mercenaries, they’re loyal enough to follow you into dangerous situations and may operate individually rather than as part of a larger force. However, their loyalty comes at a cost: they require a higher monthly fee and expect a share of any treasure you acquire during your adventures.</p><p>You can have multiple retainers, but you must be able to afford them. The higher your Emotional strength and Leadership skills, the more retainers you can effectively manage. Regardless of your emotional strength, you’ll always be able to have at least one retainer.</p><p>The Referee will generate potential retainers as regular characters, using the standard character generation rules. This is always subject to the Referee’s discretion. Retainers come equipped with basic gear, either from their initial character generation or purchased with money they earned in their previous career.</p><h5 id=\"specialists\">Specialists</h5><p>Specialists are tradesmen or professionals hired for specific non-combat tasks, like sailors to crew a ship or an alchemist to concoct potions. While they’re generally non-combatants, this can vary depending on the Referee’s discretion and the particular job they’ve been hired for. For instance, siege engineers are usually considered combatants, even though they’d expect to stay out of immediate danger.</p><p>The payment for a Specialist is determined by their specific skills and competencies. So, if you’re looking to hire someone with a unique set of skills, be prepared to negotiate a fee that reflects their expertise.</p>",

            "content_text": "Bespreekbaarheid: A Path to Openness in ITOver the weekend, I stumbled upon a Dutch word that lingers in my mind like a melody I can’t shake—Bespreekbaarheid. It’s more than just a word; it’s a philosophy that encourages open dialogue and transparency. It resonated deeply with me, not only because of my wife’s Dutch heritage but because of its profound implications for my work in IT. I began to wonder: what would change if we brought this ethos into our workplaces? What if the freedom to speak openly became the foundation of how we worked together?IT is a world of relentless change, where innovation is both the engine and the destination. Yet, beneath the sleek frameworks and methodologies—Agile, DevOps, Scrum—there is often something missing. The human element. The courage to speak freely. The humility to listen deeply. Bespreekbaarheid reminds us that our work isn’t just about systems and code; it’s about people. It’s about creating a culture where every voice matters, where every idea can find the light of day without fear of judgment.What Is Bespreekbaarheid?At its core, Bespreekbaarheid is the practice of fostering open, honest conversations in an environment free of fear or judgment. It’s not just about allowing people to speak—it’s about actively creating the conditions where they want to speak because they know their voice will be valued. You’ve seen glimpses of it in culture already: when a company holds town hall meetings to address employee concerns directly, or when leaders publicly own their mistakes, inviting feedback from their teams. It’s the foundation of psychological safety in teams and the driving force behind collaborative innovation. When a professional sports team analyzes its losses together without blaming any individual, that’s Bespreekbaarheid in action. When an organization encourages discussions about mental health or work-life balance without stigma, it breathes life into this ethos. Bespreekbaarheid is more than a corporate buzzword; it’s a cultural shift toward trust, transparency, and collective growth.The Gift of Open DialogueInnovation thrives on conversation. Yet, how often do we silence ourselves out of fear? How many breakthroughs remain locked away because no one felt safe enough to share? Bespreekbaarheid stands against that silence. It invites us to speak, to question, to dare. It nurtures a culture where even the smallest idea can ripple into something extraordinary.And what about the challenges? IT is full of them—complex problems that demand collective wisdom. Agile gives us tools like retrospectives and sprint planning, but Bespreekbaarheid breathes life into those practices. It creates a space where honesty is met with understanding, where teams can face obstacles head-on, unburdened by pretense or blame.Then there’s the weight we carry—the stress, the deadlines, the constant push for more. Bespreekbaarheid offers relief. It reminds us that it’s okay to speak of our struggles, to admit when the load feels too heavy. In doing so, it aligns beautifully with Agile’s call for sustainable work. A team that talks is a team that lasts.Building Bridges, Finding TrustTrust is fragile, yet it’s the backbone of every team. Bespreekbaarheid strengthens it. When people know they can speak freely, trust grows naturally, like a tree taking root in fertile soil. Agile depends on trust—teams self-organize, adapt, and innovate only when there’s confidence in one another. Bespreekbaarheid deepens that trust, turning collaboration into something more than a process.

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"bespreekbaarheid-a-path-to-openness-in-it\">Bespreekbaarheid: A Path to Openness in IT</h3><p>Over the weekend, I stumbled upon a Dutch word that lingers in my mind like a melody I can’t shake—<strong>Bespreekbaarheid</strong>. It’s more than just a word; it’s a philosophy that encourages open dialogue and transparency. It resonated deeply with me, not only because of my wife’s Dutch heritage but because of its profound implications for my work in IT. I began to wonder: what would change if we brought this ethos into our workplaces? What if the freedom to speak openly became the foundation of how we worked together?</p><p>IT is a world of relentless change, where innovation is both the engine and the destination. Yet, beneath the sleek frameworks and methodologies—Agile, DevOps, Scrum—there is often something missing. The human element. The courage to speak freely. The humility to listen deeply. Bespreekbaarheid reminds us that our work isn’t just about systems and code; it’s about people. It’s about creating a culture where every voice matters, where every idea can find the light of day without fear of judgment.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-bespreekbaarheid\">What Is Bespreekbaarheid?</h3><p>At its core, Bespreekbaarheid is the practice of fostering open, honest conversations in an environment free of fear or judgment. It’s not just about allowing people to speak—it’s about actively creating the conditions where they want to speak because they know their voice will be valued. You’ve seen glimpses of it in culture already: when a company holds town hall meetings to address employee concerns directly, or when leaders publicly own their mistakes, inviting feedback from their teams. It’s the foundation of psychological safety in teams and the driving force behind collaborative innovation. When a professional sports team analyzes its losses together without blaming any individual, that’s Bespreekbaarheid in action. When an organization encourages discussions about mental health or work-life balance without stigma, it breathes life into this ethos. Bespreekbaarheid is more than a corporate buzzword; it’s a cultural shift toward trust, transparency, and collective growth.</p><h3 id=\"the-gift-of-open-dialogue\">The Gift of Open Dialogue</h3><p>Innovation thrives on conversation. Yet, how often do we silence ourselves out of fear? How many breakthroughs remain locked away because no one felt safe enough to share? Bespreekbaarheid stands against that silence. It invites us to speak, to question, to dare. It nurtures a culture where even the smallest idea can ripple into something extraordinary.</p><p>And what about the challenges? IT is full of them—complex problems that demand collective wisdom. Agile gives us tools like retrospectives and sprint planning, but Bespreekbaarheid breathes life into those practices. It creates a space where honesty is met with understanding, where teams can face obstacles head-on, unburdened by pretense or blame.</p><p>Then there’s the weight we carry—the stress, the deadlines, the constant push for more. Bespreekbaarheid offers relief. It reminds us that it’s okay to speak of our struggles, to admit when the load feels too heavy. In doing so, it aligns beautifully with Agile’s call for sustainable work. A team that talks is a team that lasts.</p><hr /><h3 id=\"building-bridges-finding-trust\">Building Bridges, Finding Trust</h3><p>Trust is fragile, yet it’s the backbone of every team. Bespreekbaarheid strengthens it. When people know they can speak freely, trust grows naturally, like a tree taking root in fertile soil. Agile depends on trust—teams self-organize, adapt, and innovate only when there’s confidence in one another. Bespreekbaarheid deepens that trust, turning collaboration into something more than a process. It becomes a way of being.</p><hr /><h3 id=\"living-bespreekbaarheid\">Living Bespreekbaarheid</h3><p>Imagine this: a Scrum Master leading a retrospective where every voice is heard, not out of obligation, but because the culture invites it.

            "content_text": "   Swiss Legends and Heroic Tales  by Meinrad Lienert  Stuttgart 1915  From the Swabian War - Benedikt Fontana  Once, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Swiss had quarreled with their honest neighbors over the Rhine and Lake Constance, especially concerning the good city of Constance, which both the Swabian League and the Confederates would have liked to own. The old episcopal city would not have been unwilling to become Swiss, but when the impetuous Confederates once attacked and wanted to force it into Swiss love, the angry Constance people broke off their friendship and joined the Swabian League. This and other reasons led to the so-called Swabian War. People fought back and forth, inflicting much damage and loss, although the Swabians stayed neatly behind the Rhine and Lake Constance. It plagued the Swiss most when the Swabians called them “cow mouths” across the Rhine and began to moo and wail at their sight.  Now Emperor Maximilian, called the last knight, came to the aid of the Swabian League, and things looked bad for the Confederates. However, the Emperor wanted to force the Swiss to accept the new Imperial order and then intended to subject the Grisons and then the Confederates again to Austrian rule. The Swiss now quickly set out with all their pans to face the Emperor’s army, for if the Emperor’s army won, they had to expect terrible times for their land, since the Austrian knight Burkhardt von Randeck, a fierce Swiss enemy, had said: “I will smoke and burn in Switzerland on the day that God must blink in the rainbow from smoke and heat and draw his feet to himself.1”  But heaven heard this blasphemous speech, and the punishment followed it. For when the Emperor’s army climbed over the mountains to subdue the Grisons first, they were so excellently received by them and their confederates that he lost the war after many fierce battles, and Switzerland and her allies of Grisons had to be left forever with their freedoms.  Especially hot was the battle on the Malserheide. A man from Grisons, Benedikt Fontana, earned great fame there. He led the power of Grisons and their confederates. Now a long bulwark blocked their advance. One storm after another was repelled by the brave Tyrolean shooters behind the bulwark. When now also the Austrian enemy in the back came rushing in bright crowds, the Swiss had to fear being crushed. Then their leader Fontana took them to a last wild storm attack on the bulwark, and they managed to take the heavily armed wall. Fontana stood first beyond the bulwark. But then a sword-stroke hit him in the abdomen. His fellow fighters paused for a moment, paralyzed as they saw their leader fall to his knees. But he rose again, stretched out his sword, and cried, pressing the gruesome wound on his abdomen with one hand: “Confederates, press on! Don’t worry about my fall. I’m only one man. Today you can save the fatherland and your free leagues as victors. If you are defeated, your descendants will come into eternal bondage!” Then he collapsed dead. Now the confederates, shouting with anger and eagerness for battle, jumped over the bulwark and completely defeated the enemy after a bloody struggle.  But that blasphemer, the Knight of Randeck, had a strange fate. About a month before, he set off from Constance with ten thousand men and attacked a bunch of Confederates at Schwaderloch. They had kept poor guard and were taken by surprise. Now they had to fight their way back into the forest. The Randecker became so arrogant that he suggested they should go straight to Zurich, into the heart of the Confederacy. The leaders could not agree. So they made a mighty fire and began to cook and roast and were in good spirits. “Eh,” said the wild Randecker when he saw everything upside down, “watch out, the cow milkers2 will surely come again!”  And they came. They had retreated into the forest, where so many Swiss had joined them that there might well have been fourteen hundred together. Now they tried a ruse. They distributed their drummers all over the forest and then had them drum and roll from all sides, creating a tremendous noise. The Swabians were horrified in their merry camp, thinking that a mighty Confederate army was approaching. And when the Swiss now broke out of the forest, shouting, the warriors of the Swabian League shot too high. The Confederates, however, rushed at them, threw them back on the guns, and the terribly smoking campfire, so that many of them were scorched by the smoke and heat and suffocated. And when the Confederates then kept the field after a short battle and searched the dead, they also found the wild Knight of Randeck with singed hair and blackened by smoke next to the guns by the fire. With horror, they now remembered his blasphemous speech before the war.  As noted by: T. Tschopp  The idea of God being on the side of the winning army is quite common, but the sin of blasphemy is now lost on many.            I wonder what idiom this is and what it meant when this was writtne. &#8617;              I wonder if this term is both an insult and a compliment. &#8617;      ",
