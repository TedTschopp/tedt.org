<p>This exhaustive guide aims to be your definitive resource for understanding those complex intricacies. Covering every conceivable weapon property and classification from the simplest melee instruments to sophisticated cosmic weaponry, this compendium is tailored to cater to both newcomers and seasoned veterans of tabletop gaming. Whether you’re a player seeking to optimize your character build or a game master aiming to design balanced and engaging combat scenarios, this guide is your go-to resource. Dive deep into weapon attributes, material compositions, damage types, and many more categories that add layers of strategy and storytelling to your gaming experience.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that this guide is very much a work in progress, a living document that continues to evolve. The content is culled from an extensive range of rules, documents, and materials I’ve written over the years, each contributing to the rich tapestry of information presented here. From various homebrew rules to meticulously researched data, this compilation aims to create a harmonious blend of different systems and philosophies. Your feedback and contributions are not just welcome but highly encouraged, as the goal is to make this a collaborative and comprehensive resource for the entire gaming community.</p>

<h2 id="range-weapons">Range Weapons</h2>

<h3 id="thrown-weapons">Thrown Weapons</h3>

<p>These are weapons designed to be thrown with one hand, offering a versatile approach to combat.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Attribute for Attack Rolls</strong>: Thrown weapons the Muscle Characteristic to determine range.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternate Attribute for Melee-Capable Weapons</strong>: If the thrown weapon can also be used in melee and does not have the Finesse quality, players have the option to use the character Fitness (minimum of 1) attribute for damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialization and Skill Use</strong>: If a character has a a skill in Ranged Combat, with a focus on throwing weapons, or Athletics with a specialization in throwing objects, this can be used in place of the Muscle Score to determine Range.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="missile-weapons">Missile Weapons</h3>

<p>These weapons are designed to be thrown or fired, suitable for combat at distances greater than 5 feet. A weapon in this category has the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ranged Combat</strong>: Effective at distances greater than 5 feet.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ammunition">Ammunition</h4>

<ul>
  <li>With each attack, you must spend one (or more) pieces of ammunition.  – Change rule to roll the dice associated with the ammo</li>
  <li>Some ammunition can be used as an improvised weapon.</li>
  <li>Reloading ammunition requires two hands, even if the weapon itself can be fired with one.</li>
  <li>You typically recover half of your ammunition spent after a battle. (No ammunition is recovered from firearms or energy weapons).</li>
  <li>In the Weapon Stats List, damage listed for variant ammunition modifies the damage given for standard ammunition.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="running-out-of-ammunition">Running Out of Ammunition</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Six-shooters run out of ammunition on a failed roll that includes any 1’s showing on the dice.</li>
  <li>Many-shot weapons run out or overheat on a failed roll that includes two or more 1’s showing on the dice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Special Cases:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If you roll a 1 on an ability dice (or equivalent), treat it as a critical failure, which may include running out of ammo or overheating, depending on the GM’s discretion.</li>
  <li>If you roll a 2 on an attack roll, your weapon runs out or overheats, unless a 1 is also showing, in which case refer to the special case #1.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Range Categories and Penalties</strong><br />
Weapons have specified ranges, divided into categories as above. Each category has associated modifiers for attack rolls. Attacks can be made beyond the weapons stated range, increase the difficulty. The following traits apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Standard Range</strong>: Attacks made within the weapon’s specified range face no penalties.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Beyond Range</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>For every additional range category beyond the initial one, impose a -2 penalty to the attack roll.</li>
      <li>You may attempt an attack one range category beyond the listed maximum, but the attack roll suffers a -3 penalty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Close Quarters</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Attacking with a ranged weapon while a threatening enemy is within close range (5 feet or less) imposes a disadvantage penalty on your attack roll.</li>
      <li>If you are engaged in melee combat and attempt a ranged attack, suffer a -3 penalty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="loading-">Loading (#)</h4>

<p>This property applies to slow-loading weapons like crossbows, black powder firearms, and siege weapons.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Rate of Fire</strong>: You can only fire one piece of ammunition or make a single attack with this weapon per round, irrespective of the number of attacks or actions you have available.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-Handed Loading</strong>: It requires both hands to load the weapon, leaving you unable to use other weapons or items while loading.</li>
  <li><strong>Loading Time</strong>: The symbol “#” represents the number of actions required to reload the weapon. For instance, Loading (2) means it takes two actions to reload the weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Teamwork</strong>:  For weapons that have enough space to work around that require extensive loading time, multiple characters can contribute actions to speed up the reloading process. Each contributing character must also use both hands to assist in the loading. And each character takes up space around the weapon itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrictions</strong>:  Firing and reloading this weapon takes precedence over any multi-attack features or abilities you may have. The Loading (#) property restricts you to single attacks per round even if your character normally can attack more frequently.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="reload--shots-time">Reload (## shots, time)</h4>

<p>This property is for weapons that have a limited ammunition capacity and must be reloaded after expended shots. Unlike weapons with the “Loading (#)” property, these can be fired every round.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Rate of Fire</strong>:  You can fire this weapon every round, assuming it has ammunition remaining. The number represented by “#” indicates the maximum number of shots you can fire before needing to reload.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-Handed Reloading</strong>: Reloading this weapon requires both hands, restricting you from using other items or weapons during the reload action.</li>
  <li><strong>Reload Time</strong>:  The second number in the parenthesis indicates the time it takes to reload the weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Ammo Count</strong>: Keep track of the number of shots fired. Once you’ve reached the limit indicated by “#,” you must take the required action to reload the weapon before it can be used again.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: While reloading, you cannot perform other actions that require your hands, like casting spells or using another weapon.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="aim--rate--reload-from-source-2">Aim / Rate / Reload from Source 2</h4>

<p><strong>Aim / Rate  / Reload.</strong> Aim is the number of actions it takes to prepare the weapon for attack.  Formally Aiming a weapon will be determined by class, proficiency and feats.  This number represents the number of actions regardless bonuses from proficiency, feats, or class that it takes to get the weapon ready to attack.</p>

<p>Rate of Fire is the number of actions it takes to attack with the weapon.  Some weapons may take multiple actions.  Some weapons may allow for multiple attacks per action.</p>

<p>Reload is the number of actions it takes to reload a ranged weapon.  Please see Weapon Properties on Ammunition and Firearms to further understand this action.</p>

<h4 id="auto-fire">Auto-Fire</h4>

<p>For modern and futuristic weapons that can unleash a hail of rounds in seconds. Most automatic weapons can also fire normal single shots. Auto-fire only weapons often have the Brace quality too. There are basically three ways to use auto-fire:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All auto-fire attacks are ranged attack actions made at a -2 penalty.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Single Target Burst</strong>: Maximum range is Short for this attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Area Burst</strong>: Affects all targets that are Close to each other (typically a 2 x 2 square). Maximum range is Long for this attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Sweep</strong>: Starting at one target and if possible moving to others. Maximum range is Long for this attack.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>All uses consume ammunition of 10, (or run out on the numbers rolled listed below if not tracking ammo). – Fix this</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="double-shot">Double-Shot</h4>

<p>This property is for firearms that can fire a couple of shots quickly, such as revolvers and semi-automatic weapons that are not fully automatic. In a Western setting, this is known as Double-Tap.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: Using Double-Shot doubles the amount of normal ammunition needed. If using optional rules for rolling ammunition, it increases the chance of running out by 1 step.</li>
  <li><strong>Movement Penalty</strong>: If you move during the same round that you use Double-Shot, you suffer penalties to your attack rolls as specified below.</li>
  <li><strong>General</strong>: You can make a Double-Shot as a free action immediately after shooting at a target, to roll a second attack against the same target. If you hit with the second roll, the target takes normal weapon damage. The damage from this second attack is not modified in any way—it is only the damage value listed for the weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Movement Penalties</strong>: Moving incurs a -2 penalty to both attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="rules-missing-that-are-needed">Rules missing that are needed</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Ammo that can not be collected after a battle</li>
  <li>Ammo that can be collected and repackaged (brass shells)</li>
  <li>Ammo that can be used as an improvised weapon</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="spray">Spray</h4>

<p>This property is for weapons spreads out, increasing the chances of hitting. Often referred to as Grape weapons/shot.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Close Range</strong>: When attacking a target within what is considered “normal” or “close” range for this weapon, players receive a special bonus of a flat +2 to the attack roll.</li>
  <li><strong>Beyond Close Range</strong>: When attacking a target beyond this range, the weapon deals half damage. However, the player may choose two targets that are in close proximity to each other to attack simultaneously. The bonus gained at close range does not apply here, but the attack still benefits from the multiple target effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="flight-path">Flight Path</h4>

<p><strong>Round Flight Path</strong>
This property applies to specific thrown weapons, denoting a circular flight path for the projectile.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Determining Flight Path</strong>: Establish a circular flight path with the attacker and target on opposite sides of the circle. The distance between them also sets the ‘width’ of the flight path.</li>
  <li><strong>Intervening Targets</strong>:  If other creatures or solid objects lie along the flight path, they become the new target.</li>
  <li><strong>Hit or Miss</strong>: On a hit, the weapon lands in the target’s space as usual.  On a miss, the weapon continues along the flight path if it is clear; otherwise, it targets the next creature or object in the flight path.</li>
  <li><strong>Weapon Return</strong>: If no targets are hit, the weapon returns to the attacker, who can spend a fast/bonus action to catch it. Otherwise, it lands within Close range of the thrower.</li>
  <li><strong>Missed Landings</strong>: Subtract the attacker’s attack bonus from the natural roll made for the attack. The result is the number of Close range increments away the weapon lands from the thrower. If the result is zero or less, the weapon returns as described in point 4.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="scope--merged-from-source-2">Scope – Merged from Source 2</h4>

<p>The weapon has been fitted with vision- enhancing sights, allowing it to put shots on target from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically Extreme Range, so long as the character aims before shooting.</p>

<h2 id="area-effect">Area Effect</h2>

<h4 id="area-radius">Area (Radius)</h4>

<p>These weapons target everyone in the designated radius.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size of the area determined by weapon’s Radius number.</li>
  <li>All targets must be withing this range of all other targets.</li>
  <li>Quite often a save/check can reduce the damage of area attacks.</li>
  <li>Area attacks typically deal damage even on a miss or if targets make a successful check/save.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="blast-from-source-2">Blast from source 2</h4>

<p>Upon a hit, Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>

<h4 id="explosive-x">Explosive (X)</h4>

<p>This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will reduce damage in half.</p>

<h4 id="high-explosive-x">High-Explosive (X)</h4>

<p>This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s blast area. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.  Cover will not reduce damage from high-explosive damage.</p>

<h4 id="misfire-from-source-2">Misfire from Source 2</h4>

<p>Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapons Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try to repair it.  To repair your firearm , you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8+ misfire score)  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.</p>

<h3 id="awkward-">Awkward (#)</h3>

<p>Apply this property to large tools and improvised weapons, especially those that have more than one part that can cause damage, or to weapons that have several moving parts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A critical fumble or equivalent negative outcome occurs when you roll a number represented by “#” or lower on the attack roll or relevant ability die.</li>
  <li>If you roll “#” or lower on your Ability die, reroll the die. If you roll this value again, then it is a critical miss.</li>
  <li>Reduce the required number of 1’s by “#”. For example, if typically two 1’s are required for a crit fumble, a weapon with “Awkward 1” would crit fumble with any 1’s showing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="barbed">Barbed</h3>

<p>Weapons with barbs and back-ward-facing spikes designed to stick into a target (like a harpoon).</p>

<ul>

Where ## equals the amount of extra 6’s required to deal a critical hit following a successful attack.</p>

<h3 id="crushing---merged-from-source-2">Crushing - Merged from Source 2</h3>

<p>On a critical hit vs. a target of the attacker’s size or smaller, the attacker can choose to either a) disarm the target, or b) halve the target’s movement rate.</p>

<p>Certainly, creating rules for damage-over-time effects like Radiation and Fire can add depth and complexity to combat scenarios. Here’s an attempt to create a unified rule for such effects:</p>

<h3 id="damage-over-time-time">Damage Over Time (Time)</h3>

<p>Weapons with this property inflict damage over a period of time due to effects like Radiation, Fire, or other lingering hazards. The damage is applied at the start of each affected creature’s turn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The weapon deals its initial damage upon a successful hit.</li>
  <li>The target then takes additional damage equal to half the damage taken last time frame at the start of each time frame until the damage is reduced to zero.</li>

  <li>The target must make a Strength saving throw or equivalent, or drop their weapon. The DC for the saving throw is your attack roll result.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="double">Double</h3>

<p>A weapon with the “Double” property is essentially two melee weapons joined as one.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Each end retains the properties of the original weapons, except for the Two-handed property.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Double weapons require two hands to use but do not have the Two-handed property. They cannot benefit from features that affect two-handed weapons, nor can weapons with the Two-handed property be given the Double property.</li>
  <li><strong>Reach</strong>: If the weapon has the Reach property, only one attack per round can benefit from this property.</li>
  <li><strong>General</strong>: If a character has the means to fight with two weapons, double weapons qualify. This includes benefits from talents, styles, or features related to two-weapon fighting or light-weapon fighting.</li>
  <li><strong>Special Cases</strong>:

  <li><strong>Size and Form Limitations</strong>: Targets two size categories larger than the attacker or targets with formless bodies are immune to this property.</li>
  <li><strong>Trailing Line</strong>: For weapons with a trailing line, like the whip or harpoon, the target can move but only in the direction of the attacker. If the target remains entangled, the attacker can use their action to initiate a Strength contest and, if successful, can pull the entangled target up to 10 feet towards them.</li>
  <li><strong>Escape</strong>: To escape, the target, or another creature within Close range, must spend an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check. The difficulty varies depending on the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Destroying the Weapon</strong>: Alternatively, the entangling weapon or its trailing line can be destroyed by dealing it a certain amount of slashing damage. The weapon can only be attacked when it is restraining a target.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fast-toggle-timeframe">Fast Toggle (Timeframe)</h3>

<p>Many futuristic and modern weapons have different settings built into a weapon. Changing settings requires that you spend a certain amount of time making the changes.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Mass Produced.</strong>  A society that is two tech levels higher than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce weapon, ammunition, or armor.  When this is done, the weapon acts like it is fragile as well costing half the amount it costs normally.</p>

<h3 id="operators-rule-">Operators Rule (#)</h3>

<p>Weapons in this game may require a specific number of people to operate them effectively, especially in the case of large siege weapons or higher-tech level equipment. The “Operators” characteristic defines this requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single-Operator</strong>: Weapons with this designation require only one person to operate. These are typically handheld or easily managed weapons.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Operator</strong>: Weapons with this designation require more than one person to operate successfully. The specific number needed will be listed alongside the weapon’s description. For example, a trebuchet might list “Operators: 3” to indicate that it requires three people for optimal use.</li>
  <li><strong>Tech-Dependent</strong>: Higher-tech level weapons may require a larger operating crew due to their complexity. The number of operators will be listed in the weapon’s description and could change depending on the tech level of the society using it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="one-use-weapons">One Use Weapons</h3>

<p>Weapons with this designation are engineered for a single use, expending all their energy or ammunition in one action. After use, they are rendered inoperative. The following traits apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Armor Penetration</strong>: Weapons with this quality lose the Armor Penetration quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rend Armor</strong> Hitting an unarmored target allows you to use a fast action or maneuver to deal an extra point of damage. If you hit a target with light armor, you can then on perform a fast action to reduce their Armor rating by 1; armor reduced to 0 rating is destroyed, making the target unarmored for future attacks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shield-grappler--merged-from-source-2">Shield Grappler – Merged from Source 2</h3>

<p>Attacking with this weapon negates an opponent’s shield.</p>

<h3 id="toggle-">Toggle (#)</h3>

<p>Weapons with this quality have a trailing line that can connect to targets. The line’s length is denoted by “#.” When a weapon with the Toggle and either Barbed or Entangling properties hits a target, the following rules apply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Line Connection</strong>: A trailing line connects the target to the attacker. The attacker determines the length of the line, up to “#” units.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Breaking the Line</strong>: To break the line, the target (or an ally) must:
    <ul>
      <li>Deal 2 slashing damage, (against standard target number ).</li>
      <li>Make a Strength or Might check, with the difficulty varying by system (against a standard target number).</li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Wielder’s Choice</strong>: If the target successfully moves away, the wielder can either:
    <ul>
      <li>Drop the weapon, which will be dragged away by the target.</li>
      <li>Spend a action to keep the weapon. If the weapon has the Barbed property, pulling it free deals damage to the target as per the Barbed rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unbalancing">Unbalancing</h3>

<p>Weapons with this quality are typically weighted or designed in a way that they can throw the wielder off balance if not used effectively. If you attack and miss your target with an Unbalancing weapon, the next melee attack against you gains a +2 bonus before your next turn unless you spend a fast action to recover.</p>

<h3 id="versatile">Versatile</h3>

<p>Versatile weapons are flexible in terms of how they can be used. They can be wielded with one or two hands, offering various benefits depending on the method. The rules for small creatures and for ranged and melee uses differ.</p>

<p><strong>Melee &amp; Ranged</strong>: When used in two hands, you can reroll any one die not showing a 1.
 <strong>Size-Dependent Handling</strong>: Small creatures must wield these weapons in two hands but use the standard damage. If a small creature attempts to use the weapon in one hand, the weapon is treated as having the Heavy property.</p>

<h3 id="very-bulky">Very Bulky</h3>

<p>Some weapons are designed only for the strongest combatants. A character
using a Very Bulky weapon must have Strength 12 or higher to use it without
penalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal to
the difference between their Strength DM and +2.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-around">Wrap-Around</h3>

<h2 id="damage-type">Damage Type</h2>

<h3 id="acid-damage">Acid Damage</h3>

<p>Acid damage often represents corrosive substances that eat away at materials and flesh alike. Whether it’s a vial of acid thrown by an alchemist, a dragon’s acidic breath, or an environmental hazard, acid damage brings a sense of relentless, unstoppable dissolution to the table.  Acid damage can be highly varied and tailored to fit the mood, technology level, and general theme of your campaign, making it a versatile and evocative tool in a game master’s arsenal.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-fantasy-settings">Acid Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>In a classic fantasy realm, acid damage might come from a variety of sources. Potions or flasks of acid could be commonly sold in arcane shops or used by tricky rogues. Some creatures, like black dragons or oozes, are well-known for their acid-based attacks. Wizards and sorcerers may also have spells at their disposal that conjure acidic clouds or bolts.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-sci-fi-settings">Acid Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4>

<p>In science fiction campaigns, acid damage could be delivered via specially designed weapons that shoot corrosive substances, or it could be an environmental hazard on an alien planet. Acid might also be used as a weapon of mass destruction, capable of melting through spaceship hulls or robotic exteriors.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Acid Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>Imagine running into a criminal gang that employs acid as a weapon, or perhaps a creature of myth hiding in the city sewers with corrosive saliva. Acid might also be a hazardous material in a chemical plant, providing a mundane but dangerous obstacle for players to navigate.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-horror-settings">Acid Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>In horror settings, acid could be a particularly gruesome way to showcase the terror of a scene. Whether it’s an acidic trap set up by a malevolent entity or a creature whose touch dissolves flesh, acid damage can heighten the stakes and horror.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-historical-settings">Acid Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>Whether it’s the ancient world or a more recent setting, acid could be employed in a number of ways, from primitive corrosive substances used in traps to more modern scientific applications. In war settings, acid could be used as a primitive form of chemical warfare.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Acid Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In a world where resources are scarce, acid might become a highly sought-after weapon. It could be harvested from mutated creatures or manufactured in rudimentary labs. Traps using acid could also be a common way to protect valuable resources.</p>

<h4 id="acid-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Acid Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>Acid in a steampunk setting might come from elaborate brass and glass contraptions that spray the substance, or it could be part of the exhaust from a steam-powered machine gone haywire.</p>

<h3 id="bludgeoning-damage">Bludgeoning Damage</h3>

<p>Bludgeoning damage is the most straightforward and one of the most versatile types of damage, representing impact force against a target. This could be from a club, a falling rock, or a giant’s fist. It’s a primal and direct form of damage that lends itself to all sorts of contexts and settings.  Bludgeoning damage is a universal concept that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or genre. It’s a fundamental form of harm that resonates on a basic level, making it a versatile choice for all kinds of storytelling scenarios.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-fantasy-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>Bludgeoning is perhaps most commonly seen in fantasy settings, where weapons like hammers, maces, and staves are abundant. Monsters like hill giants or trolls may use large clubs or even their fists to deal bludgeoning damage. Traps in ancient temples might release rolling boulders, and magic spells could call down meteor showers.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-sci-fi-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4>

<p>In a science fiction context, bludgeoning damage could come from advanced, but non-lethal crowd-control weapons designed to subdue rather than kill. It could also be the result of a spaceship crash or a mechanical arm gone rogue. Even in high-tech settings, the simplicity of bludgeoning means it’s never obsolete.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>In modern settings, bludgeoning damage often takes on a gritty, street-level quality. It might come from baseball bats in a gang fight, or rubber bullets used by riot police. In urban fantasy, mystical beings might employ ancient hammers or other legendary blunt instruments that carry both physical and magical weight.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-horror-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>In horror games, bludgeoning is the staple of many a terrifying foe. Whether it’s a crazed killer with a sledgehammer or an undead monstrosity with overwhelming strength, bludgeoning damage in horror is often portrayed as brutal and gruesome.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-historical-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>In historical campaigns, the technology and weaponry might define the types of bludgeoning damage encountered. In a Roman campaign, it could be the wooden clubs of barbarians, while in medieval Japan it could be the bo staff or kanabo (a spiked or studded two-handed club).</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In post-apocalyptic worlds, bludgeoning takes on a makeshift quality. Makeshift weapons like crowbars, tire irons, or even simple rocks become essential tools for survival. Bludgeoning damage here is raw and desperate, emblematic of the harshness of life in a ruined world.</p>

<h4 id="bludgeoning-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Bludgeoning Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>In a steampunk universe, expect to see elaborate mechanical hammers, pneumatic fists, or even steam-powered mauls. These often combine the aesthetic of the setting with the primal effectiveness of bludgeoning damage.</p>

<h3 id="cold-damage">Cold Damage</h3>

<p>Cold damage represents harm inflicted through extremely low temperatures, freezing winds, or ice-based magical or elemental attacks. It’s a damage type that often has the added effect of slowing down or immobilizing targets, making it a tactical option in various settings.  Cold damage offers a versatile and often tactical form of harm that can be adapted to any setting. It can be a straightforward combat concern, an environmental obstacle, or a mood-setting element, making it a useful addition to any game master’s repertoire.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-fantasy-settings">Cold Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>In a fantasy world, cold damage might come from ice dragons, frost mages, or enchanted weapons imbued with chilling magic. The wilderness itself, particularly tundra or icy mountain ranges, can be a source of environmental cold damage.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-sci-fi-settings">Cold Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4>

<p>In a futuristic or space-faring campaign, cold damage could be inflicted by advanced cryo-weapons or malfunctioning life support systems in a spaceship. Planets with harsh, sub-zero climates may also serve as environments where cold damage is a constant concern.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Cold Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>In a modern setting, cold damage might stem from liquid nitrogen traps or experimental cold-based weaponry. In urban fantasy, perhaps a being from Norse mythology brings with it a frigid aura, or a rogue scientist has developed a freeze ray that’s causing havoc.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-horror-settings">Cold Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>Cold damage in a horror setting adds an element of dread and creeping doom. It might manifest through malevolent spirits that bring a chill to the air, or a dark ritual that plummets the temperature in an area, slowing characters both physically and mentally.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-historical-settings">Cold Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>In historical settings, cold damage is often an environmental concern. For example, expeditions into the Arctic or soldiers on winter campaigns could face the dangers of frostbite and hypothermia, which could be represented as cold damage in game terms.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Cold Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In a post-apocalyptic setting, the collapse of modern infrastructure might mean a harsh winter presents a significant danger. Alternatively, some apocalyptic event might have thrown the climate into chaos, making cold damage a frequent concern.</p>

<h4 id="cold-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Cold Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>In steampunk settings, imaginative devices like “Frost Cannons” or “Icy Ether Projectors” could be sources of cold damage. Inventors and scientists may have devised various ways to weaponize cold, adding a touch of Victorian flair to the elemental force.</p>

<h3 id="fire-damage">Fire Damage</h3>

<p>Fire damage is a classic and evocative form of harm, symbolizing both destruction and cleansing. Whether it comes from a dragon’s breath, a Molotov cocktail, or a high-tech flamethrower, fire damage often comes with the added complication of potentially spreading or affecting an area.  Fire damage is a dramatic and multi-faceted form of harm that can be adapted to fit virtually any setting or storyline. It’s both a practical combat concern and a powerful thematic element, making it a useful and engaging tool in any game master’s toolkit.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-fantasy-settings">Fire Damage in Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>Fire is a staple in fantasy settings, and it manifests in myriad ways. Wizards might launch fireballs, while warriors could wield flaming swords. Red dragons, fire elementals, and various demonic creatures often deal fire damage. Magical traps that erupt in flame are also common in ancient dungeons.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-sci-fi-settings">Fire Damage in Sci-Fi Settings</h4>

<p>In science fiction, fire damage could come from advanced energy weapons that emulate the effect of fire on a molecular level. Flamethrowers and incendiary rounds can cause fire damage, as could the dangerous environment of an alien planet with methane lakes that can ignite.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Fire Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>Modern settings offer a variety of sources for fire damage, from Molotov cocktails thrown in a street protest to arson attacks. In urban fantasy, ancient artifacts might conjure fire, or magical creatures like phoenixes might bring their own fiery destruction to the modern world.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-horror-settings">Fire Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>Fire often serves as a dual symbol in horror settings: a destroyer and a purifier. It could be that the only way to vanquish an undead abomination is to set it aflame, or perhaps a malevolent spirit sets lethal fires. Either way, fire damage in horror can be both a threat and a tool for players.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-historical-settings">Fire Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>In a historical setting, fire damage can come from a variety of sources depending on the time period. In ancient sieges, flaming arrows and pots of burning oil were used. In more recent times, the advent of firearms and artillery brought explosive rounds that could cause fire damage.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Fire Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In post-apocalyptic worlds, fire is often a primal force again, necessary for survival but also a constant hazard. Makeshift weapons like flaming arrows or fuel-filled bottles become more common, and the destruction of modern firefighting methods might make fire damage more pervasive and dangerous.</p>

<h4 id="fire-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Fire Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>In a steampunk universe, expect to see fantastical contraptions that shoot jets of flame or incendiary rounds. Fire may also be a byproduct of the many steam-powered machines that populate the world, making it a common environmental hazard.</p>

<h3 id="force-damage">Force Damage</h3>

<p>Force damage is a unique and often magical form of energy that bypasses most forms of physical resistance. It represents a pure, raw exertion of energy, often manifested as invisible or ethereal blasts, barriers, or waves. This type of damage is commonly associated with arcane or divine sources but can also occur due to technological means in certain settings.  Force damage is a versatile and often mysterious form of harm that can appear in a wide array of settings. It’s typically less straightforward than physical types of damage, offering a range of creative and tactical possibilities that can add depth and intrigue to any campaign.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-fantasy-settings-settings">Force Damage in Fantasy Settings Settings</h4>

<p>In a fantasy realm, force damage is often the purview of arcane spellcasters. Spells that shoot bolts of arcane energy or generate waves of concussive force may have the capability to inflict force damage. Certain enchanted items or artifacts may also deliver force damage when activated.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-sci-fi-settings-settings">Force Damage in Sci-Fi Settings Settings</h4>

<p>In science fiction worlds, force damage could be related to advanced technology like force fields, gravity-manipulating devices, or particle beams. It could also come from psionic abilities, where mental force is made manifest to damage or repel enemies.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Force Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>In modern or urban fantasy settings, force damage could manifest through esoteric martial arts that focus energy, or through technological means like experimental weapons. It might also come from powerful artifacts hidden in plain sight, like a seemingly innocuous pendant that unleashes a burst of force energy when activated.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-horror-settings">Force Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>In a horror game, force damage could be associated with malevolent spirits or curses that exert a damaging influence on the physical world. It could also manifest as an extension of forbidden arcane or eldritch knowledge, hurting those who dare to meddle with the unknown.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-historical-settings">Force Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>In historical settings, force damage might be limited to legendary artifacts, divine interventions, or other extraordinary circumstances. For example, a holy relic could emit a burst of force energy when used to fend off unholy creatures.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Force Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In post-apocalyptic scenarios, remnants of advanced technology or lost arcane knowledge might be the sources of force damage. A scavenged piece of tech or a rediscovered spellbook could provide characters with a unique advantage.</p>

<h4 id="force-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Force Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>In a steampunk world, experimental “force cannons” or “aetheric pulse devices” might deliver bursts of concentrated force. These could be the inventions of mad scientists, or perhaps based on arcane principles rediscovered and mechanized through steampunk ingenuity.</p>

<h3 id="electrical-damage">Electrical Damage</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fire: target of a fire attack may continue to burn (use the fire rules for the system being used).  &lt;– this needs to change</li>
  <li>Ion: this damages electronics and droids only.</li>
</ul>

<p>Electrical damage represents the raw power of electricity or other types of intense energy. Whether it’s a bolt of lightning from the sky, an electrical trap, or a futuristic laser, this damage type is often fast, focused, and devastating. It can also carry the additional effect of disrupting systems, whether those are magical constructs or technological devices.  Electrical damage is a flexible and dynamic type of harm that can find a place in almost any kind of setting. It can represent the raw power of the elements, the dangers of technology, or the mysterious energy of arcane or extraterrestrial origin, offering a myriad of storytelling possibilities.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-fantasy-settings-settings">Electrical Damage in Fantasy Settings Settings</h4>

<p>In traditional fantasy worlds, lightning is often the domain of storm gods, powerful sorcerers, and certain types of dragons. Spells like “Chain Lightning” or “Shocking Grasp” can deal electrical damage, and magical items like a “Staff of Thunder and Lightning” could give players a shocking edge.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-sci-fi-settings-settings">Electrical Damage in Sci-Fi Settings Settings</h4>

<p>In a science fiction landscape, energy-based weapons like laser guns or plasma rifles would deal this type of damage. Electrical hazards might also come from malfunctioning equipment, security systems, or the natural phenomena of exotic planets.</p>

<h4 id="ion-damage">Ion Damage</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>By means of massive electromagnetic pulses, overloading or power systems or other exotic effects, ion weapons have the potential to temporarily disrupt critical systems on board a ship without causing permanent damage. This can give a vital edge in combat while an enemy ship recovers or force an enemy to surrender before the disabling attack is followed up by something far more potent.</p>

  <p>Instead of dealing damage as usual, Ion weapons use the following rules.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When an Ion weapon successfully hits a target, roll for its damage but ignore any armour the target possesses. Instead of applying damage to the target’s hull, it is instead temporarily deducted from the target’s Power, representing the disabling effects as they spread throughout the ship and the crew working hard to keep the most vital systems online.</p>

    <p>This reduction in Power will last until the target completes its next set of actions, in either the current Ounces (⏱) or the next.</p>

    <p>If the Effect of the attack roll is 6 or more, the reduction in Power will last for D3 rounds.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-modern-or-urban-fantasy-settings">Electrical Damage in Modern or Urban Fantasy Settings</h4>

<p>Electricity is a modern marvel, and in contemporary settings, it might be weaponized in the form of tasers, electrical traps, or experimental energy weapons. In urban fantasy, an electrical attack could also be magical in origin, perhaps from a modern wizard or a mythological creature adapted to urban life.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-horror-settings">Electrical Damage in Horror Settings</h4>

<p>In horror settings, electrical damage can take on an even darker tone, perhaps being employed in torturous or sadistic ways. Haunted or cursed electrical systems can fry unsuspecting victims, and otherworldly entities might possess the power to manipulate electrical energy.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-historical-settings">Electrical Damage in Historical Settings</h4>

<p>In historical settings, instances of electrical damage might be rare but could still appear in the form of lightning storms or rare alchemical devices. Devices like the Leyden jar, an antique form of a capacitor, could be an interesting basis for an electrical trap or weapon.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-post-apocalyptic-settings">Electrical Damage in Post-Apocalyptic Settings</h4>

<p>In a post-apocalyptic world, remnants of old technology could provide electrical damage capabilities, either as booby traps protecting valuable resources or as jury-rigged weapons. Natural occurrences like lightning storms may also be more dangerous in a world where shelter is scarce.</p>

<h4 id="electrical-damage-in-steampunk-settings">Electrical Damage in Steampunk Settings</h4>

<p>Electrical damage in steampunk could come from “aetheric generators,” “lightning guns,” or other wildly imaginative gadgets. As steampunk often bridges the gap between magic and technology, these devices could operate on principles of electricity, arcane energy, or a blend of both.</p>

<h3 id="radiation-damage">Radiation Damage</h3>

<p>Radiation damage deals with forms of energy that decay or corrupt living tissue. Radiation damage is often associated with the dark arts, death, decay, and is linked to dangerous isotopes or high-energy particles.
