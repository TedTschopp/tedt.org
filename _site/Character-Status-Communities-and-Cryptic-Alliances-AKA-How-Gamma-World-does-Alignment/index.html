<h2 id="character-status">Character Status</h2>
<p>As characters have adventures, they will gain a reputation, fame, and status. You can track this growth in the campaign using Status Points. Status Points, like experience points, are accumulated into a new number on your character sheet called Rank. Rank is a measure of how your character’s reputation, fame, and status affect the reactions of NPC’s in different situations. Unlike experience points, which represents how capable a character is, status points represent how capable the society around the characters feel the character is.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-gain-status-points">How To Gain Status Points</h3>
<p>Characters begin the game with no Status Points. At the end of each complete adventure each character gains a number of of Status Points to reflect how much of a name the character made for themselves. Status Points are given for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>BEATING ENEMIES IN COMBAT: When a party wins a combat with exceptional enemies, the GM awards each surviving party member a number of Status Points equal to the Hit Point Score of all opponents they have defeated divided by the number of characters alive when the combat began times 10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GIVING ARTIFACTS TO THE COMMUNITY: A character may turn over to the political or social organization of which he is a member any artifacts he gains on an adventure (as a result of gifts or division of the spoils). The character then gets a number of Status Points equal to the Status Point Value of the item turned over. The Status Point Value of all artifacts is listed in the Equipment Tables. If there is no value for a given item the GM must determine the Status Point Value of those items. Only functional, powered artifacts that have been figured out by the character may be turned in for Status Points. An artifact requiring ammunition may be turned in only if the proper ammunition is turned in with it. If an item is turned over that is unknown, the character that turned it over gets 10% of the Status Points Value when the community its turned over discovers what it does. The character who turns over the device to a community and no one within the community knows what the device does may continue to work with the community discover the items use. During this everyone who works on discovering the devices purpose splits the remaining 90% of its status points among all contributers equitably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACCOMPLISHING A MISSION: If the GM assigns the party a mission (rescuing hostages, as in the Rite Of Passage adventure, for example), they should be rewarded for accomplishing all or part of the mission. In general, the GM should make awards of 30 to 60 Status Points per character per mission. This award should be calculated before the mission starts and it should be explained to the players as a part of hiring them in terms that make sense in game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SPECIAL AWARDS: The GM should reward excellent play or the performance of difficult tasks with Status Point Awards averaging between 200 and 500 points per task per player. Mounting a rear guard against overwhelming odds, beating an especially tough band of NPC’s or figuring out some mysterious event are examples of events deserving special awards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>EXAMPLE of Rule 1: A party of 8 PCs are commissioned to neutralize a group of androids led by an Android thinker who is an exceptional leader. The Android Thinker has 15 hit-points and is attended by 20 warriors with 20 hit-points each and 40 worker androids with 15 hit points each. When they make their way towards the Android Thinkers complex in the mountains they encounter a party of 4 workers and quickly overwhelm them and tie them up. The party gets 4 x 15 = 60 x 10 = 600 status points divided among the 8 members. So 75 Status Points. Later on their way up to the complex the group is ambushed by a group of 8 warriors escorting the Android Thinker back to the base after inspecting the work his Workers were working on. The party attacks the group, and the Thinker quickly retreats and leaves 6 Android Warriors to attack the party of 8 PCs. The 6 Warriors are defeated as are 3 of the PCs. The PCs get 6 x 20 = 120 x 10 = 1,200. There are now a group of 5. So each group character gets 240 status points. Because several of the enemies retreated, but were not defeated, they do not count towards the total. Finally the group decides that a frontal assault is a bad idea and so they come up with a plan to have their mutants sneak them into the compound to attack the Thinker Android in his private chambers. The 5 PCs attack the Thinker Android and the battle commences, during the course of the battle 4 warriors and 2 workers join the battle to defend the thinker. In the End the Thinker is defeated, as are the 4 warriors, and the 2 workers surrender once the Thinker is deactivated. However in the battle 1 of the PCs is killed and another one is knocked into a coma. In the end, the rest of the Warriors and Worker Androids, without a Thinker around, abandon their post and retreat to a sister complex on the next mountain peak. The number of status points is calculated as follows. 15 for the Android Thinker. 20 x 4 = 80 for the Warriors. 15 x 2 = 30 for the Workers. 80 + 15 + 30 = 125 x 10 = 1,250. So the total is 1,250. This total is divided up among the 4 surviving party members for a total of 312.5 status points.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE of Rule 2: The party of 4 surviving members finds a rejuvenation chamber in the complex and throw their unconscious party member into the chamber and successfully revive him. The party member who figured out how to work the chamber talks to group into giving him the chamber, and he decides to give it to the Archaic Alliance he is a member of and instantly gains one RANK. In the armory of the facility, the team finds 6 laser rifles along with a set of 24 H-Cells and a Solar Recharger. The team decides to give each member of the group one rifle and that two of the team members will get two of them. The laser rifles are worth 2,000 Status each or 3,500 Ð each. One of the team decides to turn his over his extra to his Cryptic Alliance, while the other team member decides to sell his. One of the team members gets the extra 2,000 Stats Points and his partner gets 3,500 Domars. The team decides to keep the Solar Charger and all the Hydrogen Cells as they know they are going to need to assault the position the Androids retreated to. Finally the party finds a Desk size object that is plugged into the facilities power systems that has a dome on it (Semi-Portable Broadcast Power System aka BPS). They have no idea on how to operate it, but they know its valuable and the Androids have already gotten it up on a cart when they abandoned it. The party decides to turn it over to their Cryptic Alliance. The GM knows that a BPS is worth 2 ranks, but the characters do not know how to operate it. He looks at their current Rank of 3 for 3 of the members and 4 for the guy who turned over the Rejuvenation Chamber and does the following math. From Rank 3 to Rank 4 requires 12,000 points. From Rank 4 to Rank 5 requires 24,000. From Rank 5 to Rank 6 requires 48,000 Status Points. So (3 PCs x (24,000 (Rank 5)+ 12,000 (Rank 4) ) ) + (1 x (48,000 (Rank 6) + 24,000 (Rank 4) ) ) / 4 PCs = ((3 x 36,000) + (1 x 72,000)) / 4 PCs = (108,000 + 72,000) / 4 PCs = 180,000 / 4 PCs = 45,000 Status Points on average. However because the group doesn’t know how it works so the party member who turns it in gets 45,000 * 10% = 4,500 Status Points. Now if the PCs go on their next adventure, they will figure out what the BPS is for and they would get the remaining 90% of the Status Points. However while the players were adventuring the Cryptic Alliance that they turned it over to would have had their resident scientist working on it and they would have to split the remaining status points with them.</p>

<p>EXMAPLE of Rule 3: The party comes back from pushing the Androids out of the local mountains above the town. Each Member receives 50 Status Points. The party was told that they were being hired to look into the stories the locals were telling about artificial men raiding outlying farms and that they needed to report any of their findings to the leaders. In exchange for their services the town would hold a party in their honor when they returned and they would get to tell the leaders what they found. The party would be able to keep any sort of gear or equipment they found and that if t.hey found extra weapons the local town might be interested in buying them from the players.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE of Rule 4: The GM decides that the trick the players used to sneak into the facility using their mutant powers to fool the Warrior Androids on the wall was a great idea and he decides that if they bring this up during their retelling of their adventures after the tale is over, he will award them a bonus of 400 points per player for this clever ploy.</p>

<p>NOTE: All awards are cumulative and should be announced at the end of each adventure. The only exception to this are awards for turning over artifacts are made when the artifact is actually turned over. All awards are recorded in the Status Points Box of the Character Sheet of the PC receiving the award. This status is for each group or alliance they interact with. So if someone is working with the town and an Archaic Alliance they are members of they will have Status Points with each group. For example, the player with the Rejuvenation Chamber may want to turn it over to the local Healers, while the weapons might be turned over to the town and the Broadcast Power System was turned over to the local town. This means that this player would have a status with the Healers, whatever his own Cryptic Alliance was and the town who hired him.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-status-points">How to Use Status Points</h3>

<p>Status Points are used to gain Rank. All beginning characters are Rank 0. This is the lowest Rank in the game. Once a PC successfully completes his rite of passage, he automatically rises to Rank 1. Any further Rank increase is based on the accumulation of Status Points. As soon as a Rank 1 character accumulates 3000 Status Points, he automatically rises to Rank 2. The 3000 Status Points in his Status Points Box are erased (leaving any excess points above 3000 in the box). In order to rise from Rank 2 to Rank 3, the character must accumulate twice the number of Status Points it took him to reach Rank 1 (6000). As soon as the character has 6000 Status Points recorded in his Status Point Box, he becomes a Rank 3 character and the 6000 points are erased. The cost to rise 1 Rank continues to double until Rank 6. Characters at Rank 6 and above rise 1 Rank for each increment of 50000 Status Points accumulated. Status Points expended to rise in Rank are permanently removed. There is no limit to how high a character can rise in Rank.</p>

<p>Rank 0 - Child - Starting</p>

<p>Rank 1 - Adult - Rights of Passage</p>

<p>Rank 2 - Novice - 3000 Status Points</p>

<p>Rank 3 - 6000 additional Status Points</p>

<p>Rank 4 - 12,000 additional Status Points</p>

<p>Rank 5 - 24,000 additional Status Points</p>

<p>Rank 6 - 48,000 additional Status Points</p>

<p>Rank 7+ - 50,000 additional Status Points</p>

<h3 id="rank-affects">Rank Affects</h3>

<p>Rank has the following effects on play:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A character’s Charisma is always modified by the addition of his Rank when dealing with members of the given status. Thus, a character with a Charisma of 12 and a Rank of 4 would have a modified Charisma of 16 (12 + 4 = 16). There is no limit to how high Charisma can be raised by Rank. The characters Charisma bonus might turn negative if there is animosity between the group</li>
  <li>A character’s chances of finding a particular functioning item of equipment for sale at a given Base are increased by 2% per Rank. Thus, a Rank 1 character trying to purchase a piece of Tech Level II equipment at a Tech Level I Base (15% base chance) would have a 17% chance of finding the item. A Rank 3 character would have a 21% chance. The chance of finding an item at a Base is never in- creased by more than 20 as a result of Rank.</li>
  <li>A character can borrow equipment from his community within the limits of his Rank. In order to borrow equipment, he must be at one of that community’s Bases. Thus, a member of Clan Cambol could only borrow equipment at a Cambol Base. The value of the equipment borrowed at any one time may not exceed 100 x the character’s Rank in gold pieces. Any items which are depleted (Drugs, Grenades, etc.) or which are lost or damaged by the character must be paid for by him before he can borrow any more equipment from his community. Only equipment of the same (or lower) Tech Level as the Base the character currently occupies may be borrowed. Thus, only Tech Levels I and II equipment can be borrowed from a Tech Level II Base.</li>
  <li>The die roll used to determine if a party gains a piece of knowledge they are researching is modified by the subtraction of 2 for each Rank attained by the highest Ranked character involved in the research.</li>
  <li>Characters of Rank 3 or higher may elect to formally join a Cryptic Alliance as a contributing member. A character may try once per month per Rank above 3 to join a Cryptic Alliance. Thus, a Rank 4 character could try twice to join a particular Cryptic Alliance in a given month. For each such attempt, the GM rolls d% and consults the description in PART IV of the Cryptic Alliance being joined. The Type section of each Cryptic Alliance description includes a percentage chance for each character type that the Cryptic Alliance will accept a character of that type as a member. If the percentage dice roll for the character’s attempt at joining the Cryptic Alliance is less than o r equal t o the percentage chance given in this section for his character type, the character is immediately accepted into membership. If not, the character may try again if he has sufficient Rank. If he does not have sufficient Rank, he must wait one month (30 days) before trying again. A character may try to join only one Cryptic Alliance in a 3- month period. If he is turned down by one Cryptic Alliance during that period, he must wait at least 3 months before applying for membership in another Cryptic Alliance. Immediately upon joining a Cryptic Alliance, a character treats that Cryptic Alliance as the community of which he is a member. He may no longer be considered a member of his former community.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="communities-and-cryptic-alliances">Communities and Cryptic Alliances</h3>

<p>In general, a character cannot change the community of which he is a member except by joining a Cryptic Alliance. In some isolated instances, the GM may wish to allow a character to join a new community if his own is destroyed, but this should be the exception not the rule. A character may only be a member of one community or Cryptic Alliance at a time. Once a character joins a Cryptic Alliance, he may not change the Cryptic Alliance of which he is a member. He may be ejected from membership in the Cryptic Alliance (or from some other type of community or group) at the GM’s discretion if he fails to live up to the ideals of the group. Any character who is ejected from his community or Cryptic Alliance be- comes a WANDERER (an outcast, considered fair game in the post-holocaust world). Wanderers are not able to borrow equipment since they have no community. They may not gain Status Points for turning over artifacts. A character loses all benefits specific to membership in his Cryptic Alliance as soon as he becomes a wanderer.</p>

<p>Characters who are members of a Cryptic Alliance, Clan, or other social grouping with more than one settlement or dwelling place may turn in artifacts, borrow equipment and seek free shelter (for 1 night per Rank) in any of the settlements of the group. He is not limited to using only the Base where he lives. Membership in a specific Cryptic Alliance carries the following benefits and penalties:</p>

<p>ARCHIVISTS: Members may turn in artifacts for Status Points even if the artifacts aren’t functional or powered or if they have yet to be figured out. Members receive double the normal number of Status Points for turning in any kind of Robot and receive 50 Status Points per item for turning in any artifact which does not have any other Status Point value attached to it (e.g. members get 50 Status Points for turning in any junk they don’t know what to do with).</p>

<p>BROTHERHOOD OF THOUGHT: Members receive the same number of points for successfully negotiating with NPC’s (e.g. avoiding conflict) that they would receive for beating the NPC’s. In addition, for each character a member recruits into the organization, he receives 100 Status Points times the recruit’s Rank.</p>

<p>FOLLOWERS OF THE VOICE: Members modify their Charisma by twice their Rank (not simply by adding their Rank) when interacting with Borgs, Think Tanks and Cybernetic Installations. In addition, they add their Rank to their die when attempting to figure out an artifact.</p>

<p>FRIENDS OF ENTROPY: Members receive double Status Points for beating NPC’s and triple Status Points for destroying Robots. In general, Red Death Bases consist of Tech Level II nomadic camps and only Tech Level I and II equipment may be borrowed at them.</p>

<p>HEALERS: Members receive no Status Points for beating NPC’s. However, they get 1 Status Point for each Hit Point recovered by a patient under their care. A Healer may care for a number of individuals in one day equal to his Rank. Characters may be under the care of only one Healer per day. Whenever a character is under a Healer’s care, he adds 3 x the the Healer’s Rank to the chance of recovering from illness at the end of each day. In addition, characters under a Healer’s care recover double the normal number of Hit Points that would be recovered by Resting. Healers add their Rank to their die roll when trying to figure out a medical artifact. They get double Status Points for turning in medical artifacts.</p>

<p>KNIGHTS OF GENETIC PURITY: Members get double Status Points for beating an NPC party containing one or more Humanoids. They lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time their party negotiates with an NPC party that includes one or more Humanoids.</p>

<p>RADIOACTIVISTS: Members receive 25 Status Points for each Radiation Check they must make. They get 300 Status Points for each non-defect mutation arising out of a Radiation Check and lose 300 Status Points from those they currently have available for each Defect they gain from a Radiation Check. In addition, members receive five times the normal Status Points for turning in a Mutation Bomb or Genetic Booster.</p>

<p>RESTORATIONISTS: Members get double Status Points for turning in artifacts or beating NPC parties that include members of the Friends of Entropy, Followers of the Voice, Archivists, Seekers, Zoopremists or The Created</p>

<p>SEEKERS: Members get no Status Points for turning in artifacts and lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time they get an artifact as part of their share of the party’s loot and don’t destroy it. They get 100 Status Points times the recruit’s Rank for recruiting a character into their organization and get double the normal Status Points for beating a party that includes one or more members of the Restorationists, Knights of Genetic Purity, The Iron Society, Zoopremisists, Followers of the Voice, Archivists, and The Created. In addition, they get triple Status Points for destroying Robots.</p>

<p>THE CREATED: PC’s cannot be members of this organization.</p>

<p>THE IRON SOCIETY: Members get double Status Points for beating parties which include one or more Pure Strain Humans and lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time their party negotiates with an NPC party containing one or more Pure Strain Humans.</p>

<p>THE RANKS OF THE FIT: Members get 200 Status Points times the Rank of the recruit for each character they recruit into this organization. They get double Status Points for each weapon artifact they turn in.</p>

<p>ZOOPREMISISTS: Members get double Status Points for beating a party that includes one or more Pure Strain Humans or Humanoids. If an NPC party includes one or more members of The Ranks of the Fit, triple Status Points are received. If both situations apply, triple Status Points (only) are received.</p>

<p>When modified Status Points are received for beating or negotiating with NPC’s, the Status Point award for the PC’s party is calculated normally. Then the award actually given to the PC is modified. The modifications applying to a particular PC’s Status never affect the number of Status Points awarded to his companions.</p>

<h1 id="example-cryptic-alliance---restorationsists">EXAMPLE Cryptic Alliance - Restorationsists</h1>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Restorationists are one of the more powerful and common of the cryptic alliances. They are also among the most mistrusted. The Restorationists don’t accept that the Final Wars ended the age of a better world through technology, and intend to reclaim the glories and powers humanity held a few short generations ago. Their driving goals are to rebuild the best of the past civilizations, while learning from the mistakes that ended them.</p>

<p>The Restorations don’t just wish to build a new future, they want to recreate the world as it was, only better. Though this rings hollow with many, the Restorationists assure any who listen that it is not an impossible goal. The height of technology in the previous era could almost literally mold reality as its masters desired. The Restorationists firmly believe that if that technology could be rebuilt and controlled, it could rebuild cities, end plagues, cleanse irradiated lands and end the thousand other threats. The natural corollary of this belief is that no damage done in the quest to regain these powers is unacceptable. Anything done now can be fixed later, once the Restorationists have the needed tools. The only excesses the Restorations worry about are those that might destroy the organization before it gains the needed technologies.</p>

<p>Some of the most powerful and advanced enclaves still functioning are run by Restorationists, and many more depend on Restorationist technologies to keep things running. The Restorationists have a tech base as high as any group, though their abilities still fall well short of those possessed before the Final Wars. To maintain and advance this capacity, Restorationists regularly raid old ruins and explore wilderness areas, or pay mercenary companies to do so. Anything of a technological nature, even junk, can be sold to a Restorationist stronghold, though obviously functioning devices bring a much higher price. Restorationists don’t ask where these things come from, and it’s not unusual for them to buy artifacts stolen from Archivists or taken in a bloody raid.</p>

<p>Most Restorationists are pure-strain humans, though the organization has no official bias against mutants or non-human bloodlines. In many way the reverse is more common: Creatures other than pure-strain humans have little interest in restoring the civilizations of the past. Such creatures either didn’t exist in that age, or were second-class citizens at best, so few have any desire to see the world return to that time. Many of the pro-animal and pro-mutant groups see the Restorationists as fanatics, and treat Restorationist agents poorly.</p>

<p>The Restorationists feel that renegade AIs, especially networks of AIs, were responsible for the Final Wars. In fact, they blame the vast numbers of nonhuman intelligences for all the errors of the last generation before the Wars. As a result, Restorationists believe all computers must be programmed to obey humans in general and specific operators in particular. They also believe computers must be designed to do their best to act in humans’ best interests, as the computers believe humans would define them. Though this leads to computers doing things they believe unwise because it is what they think the humans would want, the Restorationists consider this an acceptable risk to prevent computers from taking control. Only a few AIs in Restorationist hands have had such programming, with mixed results, but the organization’s computer techs continue to develop more complex and effective control routines.</p>

<p>The Restorationists do have a few allies. Healers frequently work with them to recreate medical technologies. Many groups that support order and peace work with Restorationists on specific projects, but in general organizations mistrust Restorationists desires to control everything they have a hand in building. More than one community has asked for Restorationist help, only to discover too late that the help comes with many strings attached.</p>

<p>Restorationist cities are usually highly populated. Their dependence on high tech allows them to make do with much less farming land than other groups, but they have a constant demand for power. This, combined with a limited supply of high tech, prevents their cities from becoming sprawls. Smaller Restorationist communities often make enemies faster than friends, and risk being eliminated by coalitions of their neighbors. A strong Restorationist leader can hold together a smaller town through constant vigilance, blackmail and extortion, but such towns often disappear quickly when their leaders fall.</p>

<p>Restorationists make strong allies and fearsome foes. They have a higher tech base, and a better ability to maintain it, than any other large group. For friends, they provide a market for high tech, repair facilities and often extensive creature comforts. To foes they present a serious threat, able to bring weapons of the Final Wars down on opposing cities. In both cases the limiting factor is a lack of stability. Restorationists change friends and opponents whenever it seems to move them closer to their ultimate goals, giving them a reputation as untrustworthy. This is coupled with the fact that they often run out of technological solutions without warning, often leaving allies stranded or enemies with a sudden reprieve.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Open to anything with Sentience.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Characters who have this allegiance can expect to receive scrap goods and spare parts as trading materials, items useful to high-tech groups to maintain their ancient machines. A member who takes an artifact back to a Restorationist facility, receives bonuses(up to +10 for major facilities) to the artifact check roll based on the size of the facility.</p>

<p><strong>Secret Sign:</strong> Members of the Restorationists will draw a cross or an ankh on the back of their hand with their middle finger while clasping their hands together.</p>

<p>Value: 50</p>

<p>Avg. Cost: 10 Ð</p>

<p>Power: 1-6 years</p>

<p>C-Cells (chemical power cells) are a universal power source used to power artifacts of the ancients. Considered disposable technology by the Ancient Ones and therefor mass produced, these advanced and compact dilithium battery packs were capable of producing enormous amounts of power, albeit for a limited amount of time.  They lose their charge after 1 to 6 years of disuse. When found, these power cells are usually (90%) drained of power.</p>

<h2 id="h-cell">H-CELL</h2>

<p>Tech Level: 4</p>

<p>Complexity: 2</p>

<p>Value: 50</p>

<p>Avg. Cost: 10 Ð</p>

<p>Power: 1-6 years</p>

<p>These power cells last 10 times as long as C-Cells. They are the same size as a C-Cell and can be substituted for one without risk. Similar to Chemical Energy Cells, but are less common. They don’t lose their charge from disuse.  When found, they usually (80%) have a full charge.</p>

<p>Power: Internal Reactor</p>

<p>Part of the network of power plants and satellites that once generated power for dispatch by cable or relay station still exists. Functioning BPS still gather power and broadcast it to those artifacts able to use it within its typical 20 kilometer range. In some cases, large installations or building complexes have their own mini-BPS that supplies power to units inside the complex. Artifacts will use this type of power in preference to all others if it is available. Artifacts in use when power was cut off will have switched to auxiliary power systems (until these were exhausted or shut down). Artifacts not in use when power was lost will have stayed shut down unless deliberately turned on by someone. Their auxiliary power will be untouched. Artifacts that use Broadcast Power will have a 20% greater chance of working in areas where BPS still operate. BPS look like 1’ - 10’radar dishes or domes.  The larger the size of the longer the range.  It should be noted that Broadcast Power is harmless to humans and machinery.</p>

<p>Avg. Cost: Priceless</p>

<p>Power: F-Pack</p>

<p>The MCII Generator was the ultimate in home power before the Black Years. It provided a virtually unlimited amount of power for the average household. The MCII is powered by pan F-Pack which generate internal fusion. This fusion process creates a small amount of subatomic particle annihilation which in turn releases a great deal of energy. Where this generator made it’s high price worthwhile is that the heat energy is converted directly into electrical energy.</p>

<p>The MCII Generator stores in a series of high-yield capacitors and batteries what energy is not immediately used. This allows the generator to only use the energy it needs to fill the capacitors and batteries, working much the same way as a car’s alternator.</p>

<p>The MCII can power just about everything tied into its local power grid. The life of its F-Pack strongly correlates to the use of the generator. Generally, modest use allows the F-Pack to last for around 20 years.</p>

<p>The solar generator was the ultimate in cheap home power before the apocalypse. It provided a virtually unlimited amount of power for the average household. The generator uses a series S-Cells to collect the sun’s energy and convert it directly into electrical energy. In older models (Tech Level 3) the sun’s heat was used to turn water into steam to run electrical turbines.</p>

<p>The Solar Generator stores in a series of high-yield capacitors and batteries what energy is not immediately used. This allows the generator to only use the energy it needs to fill the capacitors and batteries, working much the same way as a car’s alternator.</p>

<p>The Solar Generator can power just about everything tied into its local power grid. The life of its S-Cells is theorized to be about 1,000 years. Modest use allows them to keep up with power demands, but heavy use can drains the batteries and capacitors, resulting in a severe drop in power. When this happens, the soalr generator needs a full two hours sunlight to recharge itsef.</p>

<p>The Harmonic Disruptor is a highly fragile and ancient artifact. Less than 20 are known to exist, and many a skirmish has been fought to possess one. Unfortunately, these battles often end in the destruction of this rare and powerful relic.</p>

<p>The disruptor looks like a 5 meter tall cluster of violet crystals held in a PlastiSteel case with many glass covered dials and finger controls of various colors. When activated, it sends out waves of harmonious sonic vibrations that cause damage to everything within its 100 meter range.</p>

<p>All targets within the damage radius receive 4d6 points of damage until either the harmonic disruptor is disables, deactivated, turned off, or until the victim leaves the 100 meter radius. All items of glass, hard metal, pottery, hard plastic, and plaster within the radius take one point of structural damage per Action Turn. Once the item loses all its hit points, it shatters from the harmonic stresses, and becomes permanently useless.</p>

<p>There are two types of Drone Weavers known in existence.  The Sphere and the Strand.  The Strand looks like a multicolored bead on the end of a 3 foot long braided strand of spun crystal.  The Sphere is a small metal sphere, 10 centimeters in diameter, has a small control panel under a flush hatch. There is a 12-button keyboard and LED readout underneath the hatch. The Strand drones are controlled via Holo-controls via a qualified ID Bracelet.  The user specifies a trigger condition of elapsed time or motion detected (by size). He then specifies a traveling distance (0 to 500 meters) and direction. The drone weaver can lie dormant for decades without reducing its effectiveness. Once triggered, the drone rises 1 meter off the ground and floats away at a speed of 5 meters per round. When it has traveled its specified distance, it begins to wander randomly and broadcast subsonic sound waves. These cause all creatures within range to make a MS check at -3. Those that fail must flee until they can no longer hear the noise. The subsonic can be heard up to 100 meters away.</p>

<p>This strange weapon is designed to distract and injure opponents while causing minimal harm to their equipment. It looks like a thick, circular saw blade. It has a single recessed switch in the center of one side that activates it. The reverse side has a covered socket for a power cell. Thrown like a Frisbee toward the target, the flying blade begins spinning at a high speed and flies on at 20 meters per round, searching for living heat sources. It is able to distinguish the intense heat of an engine from the lower level heat of a living creature. It moves straight ahead for 10 rounds searching for targets. If it doesn’t find one, it falls to the ground, drained of energy. The initial to-hit roll is only used to determine if it is thrown in the general direction desired by the character.</p>

<p>Once it has locked onto a target, it splits into three separate blades, each attacking with +6 to-hit, doing 1d8 points of damage with each pass. Each blade can make one pass per round. After five rounds of fighting, the blades fall to the ground. Only chemical or solar power cells can be used in this device.</p>

<p>This is a metal disk about the size of a normal human hand. One side is strongly magnetized and will adhere to any steel surface with a strength of 8. A switch on the same surface turns the disk on or off. The switch is not accessible when the disk is stuck on a surface. When turned on, the disk absorbs magnetic and electrical fields within 3 feet. It can drain a chemical power cell in one round, a hydrogen cell in 10 rounds, and an atomic power cell in 20 minutes. Quantum cells are drained of all stored energy but will build up a charge when removed from the Lamprey field.  Any powered equipment affected by the disk, including robots, operates at half power. Weapons do half damage, robots and vehicles move at half speed, robots get half as many attacks per round, etc.</p>

<p>There are two weapons with the name Neural Bite.  The first one is an actual whip with poison.  The second one is a ranged version of this weapon that was inspired by the Neural Bite wip.</p>

<p>Mark I: The neural bite looks much like an ordinary whip, but the last 20 centimeters (8”) of this 3-meter-long lash bristle with small metal barbs. The barbs are unable to penetrate armor that provides an AC of 5 or less. If the barbs do penetrate, a nerve drug is injected into the opponent, dramatically altering his nervous system. This potent substance, intensity 18, acts like a paralytic poison, but results of paralyzed or worse means loss of free will (this drug cannot kill). The result is a mindless slave, who follows any orders he or she is given. The drug is injected into the neural bite with a syringe through a small rubber aperture, ringed in red, near the hilt. The weapon can hold up to eight doses at once.</p>

<p>Mark II: This looks like a silver metal ring, 1 foot in diameter, and bears a variety of multicolored beads along its perimeter.  When activated, it oscillates in the air and flies at its target using its base range.  Each turn it may attack a different target that is within melee range with a spark of energy that ignores the effects of armor and force fields.  The victim must make a save (Will Power) or call under the domination of the Neural Bite’s controller.</p>

<p>The popper pellet is an ocher kernel about the size of a large marble. To activate the item, the user throws it into an activated force field. Once it makes contact with a force field of any kind (excluding Mutational Force Fields), the popper pellet instantly gains the necessary power it needs from the field. Once attached, the popper pellet cloaks itself from IR, UV, and visible light, making it invisible to most individuals and sensors. It travels to the highest point of the force field (above the head for most powered armors and above the turret for tanks or robots).</p>

<p>While attached, the popper pellet lessens the effectiveness of the force field by five points (needed for the popper pellet’s own operations). If five points are not available, the popper pellet is unable to attach itself, and falls to the ground deactivated. The popper pellet also deactivates and falls if the force field drops for any reason.</p>

<p>When a popper pellet is thrown at a force field, the individual sees the popper pellet suddenly disappear as it comes into contact with the force field. In response, the force field generator beeps and blinks a warning stating the field strength has been reduced.</p>

<p>This looks like a double-sized flint arrowhead with iridescent edges.  When activated or flung at a target it homes in on the targets form and aura.  The victim must make a Reflex save each turn to avoid the dart, but the dart continues to attack the target until it strikes something.  When it hits it erupts in a flashing ball of electricity, harming all within 30 feet.</p>

<p>Once the Smart Dart is discharged it falls to the ground needing to be recharged again.  It will take plug into a standard chemical battery and recharge over the span of 1 hour.  It can only hold 1 charge at a time.</p>

<p>This looks like a rainbow-colored ribbon 10’ long.  When activated it animates and slithers after its target, attacking with its energized touch.  If struck a victim may make a REF Save to avoid being wrapped up in the Helix.  The victim takes progressive damage (save vs. Fortitude) each each turn it misses the Fortitude save.  The Slither Helix has 25 hit points.  It can only be harmed by physical damage.</p>

<p>This gun releases a concentrated blast of antimatter the same as a Trek Bomb. Any target not protected by a force field is disintegrated. Any force field hit takes 30 points of damage. This weapon is usually seen on Death Machines. Occasionally, this weapon was also mounted on tanks or on a mobile base as a field piece. It is also sometimes seen in a stationary emplacement, connected to a Nuclear Power Plant and controlled by a Cybernetic Installation or Think Tank. In this configuration it has unlimited power for continuous firing.</p>

<h2 id="weapons-that-are-vehicles">Weapons that are Vehicles</h2>

<h3 id="warbot">Warbot</h3>

<p>This vaguely turtle-shaped unit is 9 meters long by 6 meters wide by 3 meters tall. It has 4 Micro-missile Launchers, 6 Torc Grenade Launchers (500 meter range and 5d20 Torc Grenades), 4 Black Ray Guns (200 meter range), 8 Mark VII Blaster Batteries of 3 guns each, 1 Matter Bomb Launcher 1200 meter range and 6d6 Matter Bombs) and 6 Laser Batteries of 5 guns each (1500-meter range and 15d6 damage per battery). All Warbots have a 200 Hit Point Energy Screen. They can use all weapons simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="think-tank">Think Tank</h3>

<p>Usually building-sized units, Think Tanks have only one purpose - to plan for all possible contingencies and answer questions about the information they correlate. They were located only in very high-security areas such as space ports, secret military bases etc. Each is defended by its own permanent cybernetic installation regardless of the existence of another such installation which runs the base on which the think tank is located. Persons with Stage IV and V I.D.’s can communicate with (not control) a think tank, as can supervisory borgs and permanent cybernetic installations.</p>

<p>Each Think Tank was individually designed and built, so no two are exactly alike. In general, they were powered by 2 or more nuclear power plants, including backup systems. In practice, most of them will still operate limited to one power plant. Think Tanks depend on the organic “brains” that power the bulk of their cognitive abilities. If the Think Tank is totally without power for any amount of time, these “brains” will die and the Think Tank will be rendered useless. In many cases, still-functioning Think Tanks have developed severe personality quirks and some are outright insane due to lack of regular maintenance or spare parts (i.e. new “brains”).</p>

<h3 id="death-machines">Death Machines</h3>

<p>This 15 meter long, 9 meter wide, 3 meter high killing machine is covered with knobby projections housing sensors and weapons. Its main weapons are 2 Blaster Cannons that do 25d6 damage at a 1500 meter range. For close defense it has 6 Black Ray Guns with a 300-meter range. 4 Trek Guns that do the same damage as Trek Bombs and have a range of 180 meters, and 16 Mark VII Blaster Batteries of 4 guns each. These weapons can all fire at the same time. Other weapons include 8 Laser Batteries 15 guns each) that do 20d6 damage per Battery at a 1500 meter range and can fire simultaneously, 6 Mini-missile Launchers with 5d20 missiles fired individually and a Fusion Bomb Launcher with 5d10 Fusion Bombs. Both the missiles and the Fusion Bombs have a 3000 meter range. An Energy Damping Field fuses the circuits of Robots coming within 60 meters of the Death Machine and does 200 points of damage to all Energy Screens except its own within that range. The Death Machine’s own Energy Screen can take 400 points of damage. Death Machines are very rare and will only be found near CI’s that they are assigned to defend and from which they take orders. They almost always attack those who can’t show Stage V I.D.</p>

<h3 id="aataav">AATAAV</h3>

<p>The AATAAV is a gigantic, manlike war machine, standing 90 m tall and 36 m wide. The body is composed of energy-resistant CollaPlastic with a duralloy under-base. It must be piloted by a trained driver/gunner with a Stage V I.D.; the pilot controls all functions of the vehicle, including flight, hover, and walking capabilities, and all gunnery. Intensive training is necessary to operate the device at full efficiency, and such training is only available from certain military bases controlled by certain Cryptic Alliances.</p>

<p>The AATAAV has standard, infrared, and ultraviolet sensors effective out to 10 km, and has radar good out to 200 km. It can walk over light terrain at 25 kph, or use its hover thrusters to move over all terrain at twice that speed, for 120 minutes every 24-hour period (being limited by power and cooling considerations). For long-range travel, the AATAAV can reconfigure itself into a more aerodynamic form and fly normally, using anti-gravity pods and jet engines. The reconfiguration process takes only one minute, but during that time the machine’s weapons cannot be operated. In full flight con- figuration, the vehicle can reach speeds of up to 830 kph. Stream- lining is provided by shaping the force field around the vehicle. Because of the force field, no weapons can be used while the vehicle is in flight.</p>

<p>The AATAAV has a force-field energy screen capable of absorbing 300 points of damage. A high-intensity floodlight mounted on the vehicle’s head has a 1km range and projects a 30° cone-shaped beam. The floodlight will cause temporary blindness in most light-sensitive or nocturnal creatures within 300 m of the beam’s source.</p>

<p>Two smoke-screen projectors, mounted just below the visual sensors, are together capable of creating a cylindrical cloud of smoke or gas 30 m wide and 250 m long within 10 seconds. The smoke negates all laser attacks, ruins line-of-sight optical and infrared sensing, and can be mixed with a poison gas (intensity 3-18, as desired) useful against ground troops.</p>

<p>The AATAAV is heavily equipped and was intended for use as a shock force against massed troop concentrations. Two black-ray batteries, each holding six black-ray guns with a 600-m range, are mounted on the left and right hips of the vehicle. Each battery has a firing arc of 180° to its respective side. Each shin of the vehicle has a mortar, concealed internally but hanging out for firing. The left mortar is usually rigged for firing negation bombs, and the right one launches matter bombs (type beta). Each mortar has a 2-km range and may fire two bombs per action turn, with a supply of 40 bombs for the matter-bomb mortar and 80 for the negation-bomb mortar. The AATAAVs’ arms are each able to present a universal firing arc, quickly directing attacks in any direction. Each arm mounts three blaster cannon, doing 20d6 damage each at a 2km range. These guns are mounted around a massive central plasma-gun battery, with eight plasma guns per arm. The plasma weapons cannot be removed from the vehicle’s arms without destroying them. Because the plasma weapons use so much power, the AATAAV cannot do anything else while these weapons fire and must stand perfectly still. Finally, four standard Mark VII blasters rifles are mounted under the vehicle’s chin. These weapons have standard ranges and powers, and have a 90° firing arc to the AATAAV’s front.</p>

<p>The AATAAV is powered by a fusion power plant with a ten-year life span.The machine is rigged to automatically self-destruct (regardless of the pilot’s wishes) from a remote location, usually</p>

<p>A Military Installation. (This is an excellent way of keeping these devices out of the hands of the players.) However, the self-destruct mechanism and circuitry are considered secret knowledge, and no pilots are aware that these devices have been implanted in their vehicles. Because of the on-board guidance and fire-control systems, it is impossible for the pilot of a AATAAV to accidentally shoot his own vehicle in combat. An AATAAV will always remain upright unless it is depowered or purposefully made to sit down. Very few AATAAVs are in service, perhaps less than ten; only three to six of them would be in operation in North America. AATAAVs usually travel in small groups to provide fire support to one another.</p>

<h3 id="aquabot">Aquabot</h3>

<p>The Aquabot was designed to attack and destroy military installations along coasts or underwater. Twelve Aquabot were originally produced, and one industrial complex (location undisclosed) was designed to mass-produce them. It is a 3-man unit with 2 operators in the forward control room and one aft in the support fighter.</p>

<p>The Aquabot is equipped with an array of weapons systems. Four batteries of missile/torpedo tubes (6 in each shoulder, 2 in the chest) fire either underwater torpedoes (range 10km) or airborne missiles (range 200km). These are explosive, armor piercing Action Turns which cause 50d10 damage in a 300m radius. Each battery normally carries 50 missiles &amp; 50 torpedoes. 2 Batteries of 7 rocket launchers are mounted in the units forearms. These rockets have a range of 100km (underwater) or 1,000km (air). Each causes 10d10 damage in a 150m radius. Each battery normally carries 150 rockets. Also mounted in each hand are 3 heavy beam cannons. Each cannon has a range of 2km (underwater) or 10km (air). These cannons cause 50d10 damage to structural targets or 10d10 to soft targets. Finally, the Aquabot carries 2 batteries of 4 light beam cannons. These have a range of 1km in any terrain. They cause 10d10 damage to structural targets or 5d10 versus soft targets.</p>

<p>Mounted in two hard-points on the units chest are defensive shield projectors which absorb 500 points of damage each, and can completely renew themselves every 20 minutes. These projectors are also linked to a defensive bubble system which allows the shields to envelope the unit underwater and allow it to move absolutely undetected by all known sensory equipment.</p>

<p>In the event that the unit suffers extreme damage, the control head functions as a detachable pod and may move away from the field of battle. The pod may only detach when all other systems have been destroyed. The pod may automatically detach if control personnel are incapacitated for any reason.</p>

<p>Docked at the tail of the Aquabot is an independently maneuverable support fighter for land-based warfare. When detached the support fighter mounts 8 small beam-cannons and has 100 Hit Points. It is equipped with a 50-point shield generator which renews itself every 40 minutes.</p>
