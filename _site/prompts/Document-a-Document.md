Make sure the outputted Section has each piece of the Template and that the content in e section and what TOGAF says. Provide an actionable indication of what content goes here, what instructions go here, and an example of what is to be done for each of the numbered bullet points in the template. For the Example part of the template, please use a customer facing AI powered Chatbot as the solution and give an example based on that.
