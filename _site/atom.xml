      <published>2025-08-07T02:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2025-08-07T02:00:00-07:00</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Practical-Hexcrawl-Design-and-Procedures/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-hexcrawl&quot;&gt;Why Hexcrawl?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good hexcrawl is not a travel simulator. It’s a &lt;strong&gt;structured uncertainty engine&lt;/strong&gt;. It trades scripted plot for layered geography, living factions, shifting risk envelopes, and consequential navigation choices. The map &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the argument of play: &lt;em&gt;“What do you do next?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve broken this into repeatable layers you can actually use at the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-1-purpose-before-parchment&quot;&gt;Layer 1: Purpose Before Parchment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you draw a single river ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What pressure pushes people outward? (Famine, war, prophecy, scarcity, mandate)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What resists encroachment? (Terrain, weather, curse zones, political interdictions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What rewards deeper push? (Relics, fertile basins, lost routes, metaphysical leverage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What changes if the region is fully mapped? (Shifts economy, unlocks factions, unleashes sealed threat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write three sentences answering those. Everything else hangs off them. Put them in your referee notes margin. If something doesn’t serve one of those sentences, eject it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-2-scale--discipline&quot;&gt;Layer 2: Scale &amp;amp; Discipline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-level-hex-zoom-cascade-36--6--1-mile&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three-Level Hex Zoom Cascade (36 → 6 → 1 Mile)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This streamlined model keeps only three practical tiers: a broad strategic frame (36), the classic daily exploration layer (6), and the tactically precise local layer (1). Fewer tiers = faster prep and clearer player mental maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;36-miles-per-hex--strategic-region&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 Miles per Hex – Strategic Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Map large territories spanning multiple polities or sweeping frontier zones; establish macro terrain, major routes, and anchor regions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Zoom Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; When players focus on a borderland, frontier, or specific kingdom segment — zoom to 6-mile hexes for wilderness-ready play.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Settings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Iberian Peninsula (Reconquista arc)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;British Isles (Viking or Saxon pressures)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Silk Road steppe / caravan corridor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-miles-per-hex--wilderness-exploration-core&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Miles per Hex – Wilderness Exploration Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Primary hexcrawl layer; one hex ≈ a day’s mixed-foot travel (adjust for terrain). Stock anchors, active sites, and anomalies here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Zoom Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; Approaching a keyed site cluster, settlement environs, complex valley, or battlefield — zoom to 1-mile hexes for spatial choices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Settings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Contested marches / border counties&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mountain basins &amp;amp; upland plateaus&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Great forest interiors / national parks analogs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-mile-per-hex--local-tactical-detail&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Mile per Hex – Local Tactical Detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Site adjacency, farmland rings, fortress approaches, hamlet clusters, environmental micro-features; supports precise approach vectors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Zoom Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; Entering settlement limits, staging an assault, micro‑navigating hazards, or transitioning to dungeon / structure / battle maps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Settings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Walled town + fields + mills&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fortified pass choke &amp;amp; watch towers&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Estate, quarry, or battlefield layout&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrated-scale-cascade-table&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Scale Cascade Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Tier&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Hex Size&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Scope&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Tactical Zoom Trigger&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 mi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Strategic region&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Focus narrows to frontier zone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Iberian Peninsula, British Isles&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 mi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Wilderness core&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Approach a keyed/local site area&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Border counties, mountain basins&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 mi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Local tactical&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Enter settlement / assault / setup&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Town fields, forts, estates&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      &lt;!-- Legend populated by hex-multi-scale.js --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Drag to pan. Use buttons, mouse wheel, pinch (touch) to zoom, or reset.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/js/hex.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;/js/hex-multi-scale.js&quot; defer=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-3-minimal-base-stocking&quot;&gt;Layer 3: Minimal Base Stocking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop trying to lovingly handcraft every cell. Seed with &lt;strong&gt;density bands&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Hex State&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;% of Region&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Content Goal&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Anchor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5–10%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Campaign identity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Capital, Mythic ruin, Great river confluence&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Active&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;15–25%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Drive decisions&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Faction fort, Trade choke, Weather node&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lurking&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;25–35%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Delayed reveal&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sealed vault, Rotting god husk, Dormant colony&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Empty (textured)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30–45%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Contrast &amp;amp; travel pacing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Broken causeway, Burn scar plain, Chatter dunes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only fully key Anchors and the first wave of Actives. Lurking slots get a &lt;strong&gt;one-line seed&lt;/strong&gt;. Empties get a &lt;strong&gt;terrain note + a travel complication die&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-4-terrain--decision-pressure&quot;&gt;Layer 4: Terrain = Decision Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every terrain tag should do work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alter navigation cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modulate encounter table composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convey risk signals (auras, carcasses, weather signatures)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Telegraph deeper structure (river direction implies mountain ridge, basalt flows imply old catastrophe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;one anomaly per 6–8 hexes&lt;/strong&gt;: inverted waterfall, glassed crater ridge, migrating sinkholes. Players remember anomalies more than generic forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-5-encounter-architecture&quot;&gt;Layer 5: Encounter Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounters are not random events; they’re &lt;strong&gt;state probes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily Encounter Procedure (example):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Morning: Weather shift / omen check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midday: Navigation hazard OR social contact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Afternoon: Predator / territorial assertion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Night: Camp complication / haunting / pursuit catch-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use different dice per zone (d8 civilized edge, d10 frontier, d12 deep) to &lt;strong&gt;widen variance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounter Table Structure (d12):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–3: Terrain expression (living geology, weather burst)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4–5: Faction patrol / scout / courier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6: Resource cache / salvage / spoor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7–8: Creature with motive intersecting party vector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9: Consequence echo from prior choice (fire spreads, rumor manifests)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10: Lurking site teaser&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11: Environmental escalation (storm front walls travel, fae tide rises)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12: Clock advancement / front progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each result should &lt;strong&gt;ask a question back&lt;/strong&gt;: Who sent them? What do you do with it? Do you press on? If a result doesn’t change player calculus it’s ornamental; cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-6-time--clocks&quot;&gt;Layer 6: Time &amp;amp; Clocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep three visible pressure dials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Clock&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Segments&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Advances When&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Frontier Consolidation&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;PCs map anchor + report / Faction treaty&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sleeping Engine Wakes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Arcane extraction, seismic events&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Famine Wave&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Supply convoy lost / harvest delayed&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark segments on triggered encounters. When a clock fills, it &lt;strong&gt;re-keys 3–5 hexes&lt;/strong&gt; (change occupants / conditions) and you tell the players what shifted. The world moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-7-travel-turn-loop-referee-card&quot;&gt;Layer 7: Travel Turn Loop (Referee Card)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep a simple loop card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEX TURN LOOP
1 Declare destination / vector
2 Check route known? If not -&amp;gt; navigation test
3 Mark movement (log hex ID) &amp;amp; decrement light/rations/water
4 Terrain feature? (if first entry) -&amp;gt; describe + question
5 Encounter slot resolution
6 Player actions (scout, forage, track, research, ritual)
7 Log notable state changes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players learn this rhythm and start &lt;strong&gt;pre-planning actions at step 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-8-information-economy&quot;&gt;Layer 8: Information Economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players decide better when &lt;strong&gt;information has tiers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vague rumor (region-level: “South marsh breathes at night”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Directional sign (terrain cue: “Trees bent inland”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirming detail (multi-sense: “Pulsing heat ripples over mud”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immediate hook (actionable: “Steam vents align like a rune circle”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reward triangulation: if they collect three independent confirms, grant a &lt;strong&gt;tactical advantage tag&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. +1 initiative in that hex type, skip first hazard roll, negotiate from strength).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-9-resource-tension-without-bean-counting&quot;&gt;Layer 9: Resource Tension Without Bean Counting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track only deltas that affect decisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light: Safe navigation at night / reduces ambush chance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food: Force risk-taking if low (forage table may escalate clocks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encumbrance Band: Normal / Strained / Overloaded (each band adds cost or slows hex rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract ammo unless the fiction demands scarcity. Let &lt;strong&gt;weather + terrain&lt;/strong&gt; be your meaningful attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-10-factions-as-mobile-terrain&quot;&gt;Layer 10: Factions as Mobile Terrain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat factions like shifting terrain overlays:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patrol zones (expand / retract based on clocks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence markers in hexes (affect encounter substitutions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supply lines (cutting them rewrites future tables)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give each major faction a &lt;strong&gt;stance matrix&lt;/strong&gt; (Need, Fear, Leverage). An encounter can flip one cell. Progress visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-11-emergent-sites-on-demand&quot;&gt;Layer 11: Emergent Sites On Demand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When players laser-focus an empty-ish hex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll / pick one Lurking seed to mature early&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a terrain anomaly to justify why it was hidden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tie it to an advancing clock or faction motive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop a &lt;strong&gt;choice fork&lt;/strong&gt;: deeper delve, bargain, escalate risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This keeps prep elastic and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-12-mapping-conventions-players-see&quot;&gt;Layer 12: Mapping Conventions Players See&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show them a cleaned layer (rivers, coasts, major ridges). Let &lt;strong&gt;player map evolves&lt;/strong&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dashed outline = uncertain edge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Icon with circle = confirmed site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hollow icon = rumored site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Color wash = hazard zone (after 2+ confirmations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will begin setting their own vector goals. Momentum happens when &lt;strong&gt;I ask less “What now?” and more “Are you changing plan?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-13-failure-is-cartographic&quot;&gt;Layer 13: Failure Is Cartographic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missed navigation? Don’t say “You’re lost.” Say: “You emerge at a basalt rim with steam fissures—this is Hex H13; your intended vector shifts one column east unless you backtrack (costs 1 watch). Proceed?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure produces &lt;strong&gt;new known geography&lt;/strong&gt; plus a resource or time tax. Nothing dead-ends. Even ambushes should teach about faction reach or terrain teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-14-session-close-state-log&quot;&gt;Layer 14: Session Close State Log&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At end of session capture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hexes entered (ID list)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New / changed sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clocks advanced (segments + triggers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faction state flips&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource bands crossed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outstanding player-declared goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Building-a-Lego-Cat/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottom-line-up-front&quot;&gt;Bottom Line Up Front&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article draws from notes taken during a discussion between a Harvard Business School professor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Fuller&quot;&gt;Joeseph Fuller&lt;/a&gt;. and OpenAI’s Chief Economist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Chatterji&quot;&gt;Ronnie Chatterji&lt;/a&gt; on the future of work and talent in an AI-driven world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI into the electric utility industry’s supporting capabilities will significantly reshape workforce roles, placing greater emphasis on human skills such as empathy and communication. Organizations must proactively prepare employees through structured experiential learning, new management skills for overseeing virtual AI colleagues, and reconfiguring workflows to align with AI best practices. Immediate actions include conducting skills audits, initiating regular training workshops, and developing specialized AI oversight roles to effectively navigate this essential transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-lego-cat&quot;&gt;Building a Lego Cat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter, Hannah, spent months carefully saving every penny she earned, eagerly anticipating the moment she could finally purchase an elaborate Tuxedo Cat Lego set. When the Lego set arrived, she sat down, excited but a bit overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of the pieces laid before us. Initially, she thought she could simply dive in and complete the project quickly, relying solely on her enthusiasm and the provided instructions. But soon, she realized the value of seeking guidance from me and her brother, as both of us had built similar complex models before. It wasn’t just about following instructions; it was about benefiting from experienced insights, learning proven techniques, and understanding the underlying principles of constructing something new and intricate. Hannah’s initial hesitation and gradual confidence mirror the uncertainty and eventual empowerment employees may feel during significant organizational changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stand at the threshold of immense change. Generative AI isn’t simply a new tool—it’s a fundamental shift in how we manage talent and workflow. Roles previously stable will evolve dramatically, with some opportunities closing and new ones emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations must proactively guide their teams through this transition, helping employees identify skills worth cultivating. When routine tasks become automated, what remains valuable? The answer lies in distinctly human capabilities: social interactions, emotional intelligence, and nuanced interpersonal skills. These soft skills, often overlooked, will soon become paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many anticipate AI adoption as an overnight shift—a binary moment. Reality, however, is more nuanced, with changes unfolding gradually across industries. In the electric utility industry, complexities such as regulatory hurdles, operational reliability, and legacy technology infrastructure naturally slow technology adoption. We’re in transition, and it’s unrealistic to immediately expect incoming talent to fully embrace new AI competencies without the guidance of those who’ve navigated similar changes before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a call for organizational reflection. Traditional roles must be reconsidered—perhaps the countless PowerPoint presentations we’ve grown accustomed to would be more effectively delivered interactively through AI-driven agents or bots. For example, internal HR briefings might transform into AI-driven systems that provide personalized answers on employee benefits or career development paths, significantly improving employee satisfaction and reducing administrative workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI will reshape organizational structures dramatically. Today, typical corporate hierarchies consist of executives (1%), managers (9%), and employees (90%). While AI will not change this ratio, it will change 41% of the tasks typically handled by employees. We might see fewer managerial layers, more specialized AI oversight roles such as AI Ethics Managers or AI Integration Specialists, and agile cross-functional teams emphasizing human-AI collaboration within supporting capabilities such as HR analytics, finance budgeting, or procurement strategy. Additionally, employees will increasingly manage virtual AI team members, requiring them to develop management-oriented skills previously expected only from supervisors or managers, such as task delegation, workflow oversight, and performance monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sluggish pace of AI integration often stems from the question: “How can we use this to improve our current processes?” It’s a natural response to something like AI, but adopting this mindset is limiting. A transformative approach asks instead: “How can we fundamentally reconfigure our processes to fully leverage AI, aligning ourselves with the best practices AI inherently understands?” For instance, instead of merely enhancing current financial reporting processes, utilities might entirely reimagine budgeting and forecasting using AI-driven financial analytics platforms, enabling real-time insights, reduced errors, and enhanced decision-making speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy firms, including electric utilities, face substantial risk if they focus on just improving their processes and resist wholesale re-engineering their workflows. New generative AI startups, unhindered by traditional structures and regulatory baggage, pose significant competitive threats by rapidly adopting AI-driven methodologies in supporting areas like automated HR processes to streamline recruitment, intelligent procurement systems to enhance supply chain efficiency, AI-driven finance analytics for precise and agile budgeting, and virtual training and onboarding programs to rapidly equip employees with necessary skills. Delaying adoption can place utilities at a severe competitive disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiential learning emerges as critical to navigating this shift. Employees and leaders must engage in hands-on, interactive education guided by AI veterans who’ve also successfully navigated technological and organizational transitions in the past. For supporting capabilities, this might look like HR teams regularly practicing with AI-driven recruitment and retention tools, finance departments running real-time analytics exercises for agile budgeting, or procurement teams conducting simulations with intelligent supply-chain management software. Regular practice—meaning structured activities scheduled consistently, such as weekly workshops or monthly training sessions—accelerates comfort, reduces resistance to adoption, minimizes errors, enhances productivity, and ensures smoother transitions, particularly in risk-averse environments like utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s natural for employees to experience concern or uncertainty about the integration of AI into their roles. Organizations must proactively acknowledge and address these concerns, reassuring employees through clear communication, education, and demonstrating how AI complements rather than replaces their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively prepare for this new emphasis on soft skills, organizations should first clearly identify the interpersonal and emotional competencies most relevant to their industry and workforce. Skills such as empathy, active listening, effective communication, and emotional intelligence can be assessed through targeted surveys, feedback sessions, and performance reviews. Once identified, training can include role-playing scenarios, peer-to-peer coaching, interactive workshops, and continuous feedback mechanisms, ensuring that these essential human skills are cultivated deliberately and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;actions-to-take-now&quot;&gt;Actions to Take Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conduct a skills audit to identify human-centered skills that will grow in importance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch structured, regular AI experiential learning workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish clear communication channels addressing employee concerns about AI adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin piloting AI solutions in supporting capability areas, like HR, procurement, or finance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foster mentorship programs connecting AI veterans with employees new to AI technology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define specialized AI roles and begin developing talent internally to fill these positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Lego set, Hannah quickly learned the value of expert advice. She discovered strategies that streamlined our building process and deepened our enjoyment of the project. It wasn’t about doing everything ourselves or suddenly becoming Lego masters overnight—it was about recognizing the wisdom and experience available around us. Similarly, our organizational journey with AI should rely on insights from those who’ve faced parallel challenges. Embracing their expertise, we’re better equipped to build a future that’s innovative, resilient, and deeply human. Hannah’s growing confidence and eventual joy in mastering the complex Lego set can similarly reflect the emotional journey employees will experience as they adopt and master new AI-driven processes. Like Hannah, they will likely move from initial uncertainty to increased confidence, satisfaction, and fulfillment as they successfully navigate this important transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/Rooted-In-Resilience</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Rooted-In-Resilience/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line Up Front:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the enterprise software landscape, challenging established methods and requiring utilities and other large enterprises to rethink their technological strategies fundamentally. To thrive, organizations must shift from static, infrastructure-bound solutions toward agile, adaptive systems empowered by AI-driven, “just-in-time” capabilities. Embracing this transformation proactively, with awareness of both opportunities and inherent challenges, will be essential for resilience and sustained innovation.&lt;/em&gt;e: “Rooted in Resilience: Navigating the AI Revolution in Enterprise SaaS”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every autumn, when the Santa Ana winds sweep across Southern California, I watch how the landscape responds. Some trees and plants stand firm, deeply rooted, unaffected by the fierce gusts. Others, fragile or poorly anchored, bend and break under the relentless force. Observing this annual dance, I’m reminded how resilience—whether in nature, our communities, or our enterprises—depends profoundly on how deeply and securely we anchor ourselves when inevitable storms arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in a large utility enterprise, where our reliance on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions and legacy on-premise or on-device software forms the backbone of our daily operations, we often feel secure in our technological roots. It has served us well for years, and we have invested decades perfecting it. Yet, a new storm is gathering on the horizon: artificial intelligence. It’s neither distant nor theoretical anymore; it’s here, and it’s reshaping the landscape faster than many anticipated. Our traditional software—carefully built, maintained, and often bound by physical infrastructure—faces unprecedented disruption. To thrive—not merely survive—we must understand what this storm means for both our existing systems and future strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared a fascinating vision of the future of AI, particularly its implications for B2B SaaS companies. Reflecting on this, I felt a familiar tug at my spirit—a blend of apprehension and excitement. Altman’s perspective is particularly relevant because it directly addresses the existential questions that large enterprises and their technology groups face today. Here’s an edited and expanded excerpt from an interview that deeply resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; “So one of the things that we’ve been debating at Y-Combinator is whether Artificial Intelligence is inherently good. It might be scary for software engineering companies creating B2B SaaS solutions. Imagine a future where each user has their underlying database. There’s an API layer integrated with your identity for access control, enforcing business logic, ensuring only the right people access the right information. An interface to a large language model (LLM) replaces your computer, creating just-in-time software tailored to your immediate needs. Say you have a complex business issue; you go to your machine, and it generates the exact code, artifact, or document needed—or retrieves it instantly from your filesystem when required again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman:&lt;/strong&gt; “That’s going to happen. There are two ways you can approach this. First, you can see this as the best time ever for startups because everything is shifting dramatically. Yes, as a Cloud SaaS company, it might feel unsettling that code we once carefully crafted could soon be generated instantly and automatically. It forces us to ask: What does this mean for us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, you might view this as an extraordinary leveling of the playing field. Traditionally, large enterprises held advantages—deep pockets, wide distribution—but their slow pace often held them back. Now, AI changes that calculus dramatically. It’s inexpensive compared to its enormous benefits, diminishing traditional advantages of scale and budget. The software landscape, as we’ve known it, is about to change completely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The challenges AI brings are universal—no one is immune. But here’s the crucial insight: when the industry’s clock cycle shifts, as it is now, from Moore’s Law to the rapid iteration pace set by AI, startups historically win. The magnitude of this change is unprecedented. Act accordingly, with an entrepreneurial spirit. Companies concerned about defensibility might say, ‘We’re just a SaaS company,’ while others confidently declare, ‘We’re a just-in-time software company.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altman’s insights bring into sharp focus the critical truth facing those of us entrenched in large, enterprise SaaS environments. Change is no longer incremental—it is seismic. AI isn’t just another storm; it’s a hurricane. Within our own IT Technology Strategy Group, we’ve engaged in lengthy discussions about this transformative shift—imagining future software as expansive cloud-based databases wrapped in layers of “self-driving software” that dynamically adapt to the evolving needs of users on any given day. Practically, this means software would anticipate user tasks, automatically adjusting workflows, creating real-time customizations, and proactively offering solutions, much like a skilled assistant who learns your preferences and anticipates your next request. This upheaval is an invitation to transform—to deepen our roots in adaptability, agility, and vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change echoes another pivotal shift from our company’s past. When we first approached electrification, it was as revolutionary then as AI feels today. For example, the transformative moment of electrifying Los Angeles in 1917 marked a profound shift in industry and daily life. We offered cities and large organizations the ability to delegate their energy challenges—generation, transmission, and distribution—to us. In turn, we provided a reliable grid where consumers could easily plug in their tailored, just-in-time tools: refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and, more recently, electric cars. Similarly, industries connected their factories, assembly lines, lights, fans, industrial equipment, and today’s robotic factories manufacturing electric vehicles. This historical analogy reminds us of our inherent strength in embracing change and innovation. We should recognize this pattern clearly, understand its implications, and resonate with its call for agility and adaptability today, just as we did a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As leaders and contributors in utility companies deeply reliant on SaaS, we must internalize Altman’s wisdom: embracing AI means reevaluating not only our technology stacks but also our fundamental strategies and mindsets. Our ability to swiftly respond to immediate needs, rather than leaning solely on static, prebuilt software, could redefine how effectively we serve our customers and maintain our infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, storms can uproot, disrupt, and devastate. But they also clear away the old, providing fertile ground for fresh, vibrant growth. Perhaps this AI-driven tempest is precisely what we need—a compelling reason to reassess and recommit ourselves to innovation, resilience, and proactive transformation. Yet, we should also recognize that this transformative journey may face challenges: employee resistance, uncertainty about changing roles, and apprehension about adopting entirely new ways of working. Acknowledging these obstacles openly can help us navigate them thoughtfully and compassionately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of uncertainty, let’s choose not merely to withstand but to flourish. After all, deep roots don’t fear storms—they welcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2025-06-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Learning-by-Doing-How-Scouting-Wisdom-Can-Guide-our-AI-Journey</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Learning-by-Doing-How-Scouting-Wisdom-Can-Guide-our-AI-Journey/">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday for Father’s Day, I took Pieter to his first week-long BSA Scout camp. He’s excited, filled with anticipation, and perhaps a hint of anxiety. He knows he has moved up from Cub Scouts into a new adventure—learning knots, mastering the art of fire-building, exploring navigation, and absorbing crucial first-aid skills. The curriculum he’ll engage with this week focuses on the fundamentals of Outdoor Scouting. However, this week isn’t an end unto itself; it will prepare him for what comes next—a focus on the softer skills of leadership, service, teamwork, communication, conflict resolution, respect, and mentoring. Having participated in the program myself as a kid, I know his camp counselors won’t just be instructors; they’ll be attentive guides, sensitive to each scout’s unique story, background, and pace, adjusting and tailoring their teaching to offer personalized paths to mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Fortune reminded us of something profoundly simple yet easily overlooked—&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/ai-employee-training-simulation-labor/&quot;&gt;mastering AI isn’t just a skill like fire-building or navigation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a skill that prepares you for what’s next, a way of working where learning with AI is woven seamlessly into the tapestry of your daily tasks. Like learning to speak or ride a bike, this happens naturally, moment by moment. Companies aren’t merely instructing employees on “how” to operate AI; they’re inviting them into a dynamic partnership, where technology and human intuition grow together, deeply intertwined. This isn’t about static training manuals or rigid workshops. Instead, it’s about real-time adaptation, exploration, and discovery alongside the very tools shaping our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-way-to-learn&quot;&gt;A New Way to Learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has become your co-creator, dynamically generating content that makes your learning vivid and immediate. Gone are dull, static presentations. In their place, imagine interactive scenarios, simulations responsive to your every move. Learning becomes less about absorbing information and more about experiencing growth in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-time-guidance-and-grace&quot;&gt;Real-Time Guidance and Grace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine an assistant patiently standing beside you, gently providing the exact guidance or checklist you need precisely when you need it. AI can offer you compassionate, continuous support, allowing you to practice new skills safely, free from the fear of costly mistakes, thereby hastening genuine mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transforming-your-workdeeper-richer&quot;&gt;Transforming Your Work—Deeper, Richer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI training isn’t about reducing your role—it’s about enhancing it. AI handles repetitive or high-risk tasks, giving you room to engage your deeper capacities: reasoning, empathy, judgment, and creativity. This shift allows you to perform work that is inherently human, filled with meaning and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-does-this-matter-to-you&quot;&gt;Why Does This Matter to You?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; By weaving AI directly into your daily routines, you quicken your path from novice to mastery, especially in complex or customer-facing roles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Allocation of Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; By partnering with AI models that assist and offer feedback on routine tasks, you free up space to engage in deeper journeys—cultivating wisdom, shaping culture, and nurturing leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safer, More Effective Training:&lt;/strong&gt; In high-stakes environments—compliance, security, client interactions—AI creates safe spaces for you to learn from errors, helping you grow confidently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-ahead&quot;&gt;The Path Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering how to personally step into this evolving landscape of AI-enabled learning, here’s a guide to help you navigate your journey. This isn’t just about corporate transformation—it’s about your own growth, your rhythm, your pace. These steps invite you to reflect, experiment, and ultimately thrive in partnership with intelligent tools that are here not to replace you, but to help you grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Step&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;What You Gain&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Reflect &amp;amp; Identify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Take stock of your role. Where might AI help you learn faster or make fewer errors?  See the posts about WINS from previous weeks.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;New insight into how your daily tasks can be enhanced and elevated.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Partner &amp;amp; Create&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Team up with colleagues and tech partners to shape AI tools around real challenges.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Personalized workflows, tools, and scenarios make your learning come alive.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Experiment &amp;amp; Learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Try small pilots—use the AI. Get feedback. Adjust. Repeat.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Confidence, fluency, and new ways of solving familiar problems.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Share &amp;amp; Grow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Share what works, measure your growth, and help build a culture of learning.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Visibility, influence, and the satisfaction of shaping our collective future.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embrace-a-human-centered-future&quot;&gt;Embrace a Human-Centered Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You aren’t simply adding another tool—you’re reshaping how you learn, grow, and connect. By trusting AI with routine tasks, you create space for meaningful, human-centered development. It’s your journey towards deeper creativity, stronger judgment, and greater autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-final-reflection&quot;&gt;A Final Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Pieter steps into this transformative week at Scout camp, guided by thoughtful counselors who adapt to his personal story, you too are invited into an adventure of growth—one shaped by thoughtful, adaptive AI guidance. Just as he will emerge with new skills and deeper confidence, embracing AI in your work promises similar outcomes: greater mastery, deeper insights, and meaningful human connections. Let’s move forward together, thoughtfully, eagerly, and openly, into this new, hopeful chapter of our shared learning journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/Riding-the-AI-Wave-This-Isn't-Just-Another-Trend/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Riding the AI Wave" />
      <published>2025-06-01T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Riding-the-AI-Wave-This-Isn't-Just-Another-Trend</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Riding-the-AI-Wave-This-Isn't-Just-Another-Trend/">&lt;p&gt;Bottom Line Up Front: Mary Meeker’s latest report on AI trends makes one thing clear: we are witnessing one of the fastest and most consequential technology shifts in history. AI is no longer a futuristic concept or mere hype—it’s a present reality being adopted at unprecedented speed, transforming how people work, communicate, and make decisions. This post reflects on how these trends, backed by significant investment and rapid adoption, intersect with the everyday experiences of employees across industries, viewed through the lens of a weekend campout with my son. Whether you’re navigating complexity intentionally or exploring new tools with curiosity, AI’s trajectory will impact your role, your workflow, and your future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, Pieter and I embarked on the annual father-son campout with our church. At nearly twelve years old, Pieter eagerly set up the tent and organized our campsite before running off to join the other kids exploring the creek. Some were chasing toads, others carefully scooping up tadpoles in small nets, delighting in each discovery. The next morning, we planned to head to the lake for fishing and water sports, but first, we needed to figure out how to get to the marina from the campsite. The directions initially led us astray, guiding us to a beachside parking lot meant for swimmers, not boaters. Calm and focused, Pieter navigated us with precision, reading the signs and adjusting as needed until we arrived at the marina and boat launch—well before anyone else. His quiet confidence and situational awareness reminded me of the thoughtful problem-solving and adaptability today’s workforce needs to navigate complex situations and plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting later in the quiet solitude of our tent, I realized how aptly this mirrors the explosive growth we are witnessing in artificial intelligence. Just as Pieter charted the right path to the marina by connecting scattered pieces of information, today’s breakthroughs in AI—each impressive on its own—are coming together to form a coherent, accelerating force that is reshaping our shared future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Mary Meeker is a renowned venture capitalist and former Wall Street analyst, often called the “Queen of the Internet” for her decades of tech foresight. This week, she published her latest report on current AI trends, highlighting an unprecedented pace of adoption and investment. According to the findings, AI’s expansion is surpassing even the internet boom of the late ’90s and early 2000s, driven by significant global connectivity, extensive datasets, and groundbreaking technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report reveals compelling statistics: ChatGPT amassed 800 million weekly active users within just 17 months, marking an astonishing eight-fold increase since its inception. Additionally, tech giants—Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—have ramped up their capital expenditure by an astounding 63% year-over-year, underscoring their substantial commitment to the infrastructure needed to support AI’s rapid growth. Clearly, these rapid adoption figures signal more than incremental technological advances—they highlight transformative shifts enterprises must strategically navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond impressive figures lies the profound impact AI holds for our daily lives, workplaces, and society at large. We are witnessing the rise of intelligent, autonomous agents capable of streamlining complex, mundane tasks—a shift comparable to the revolutionary transition from static websites to dynamic web applications decades ago. Consider AI-powered document summarizers that help employees quickly digest long reports or customer feedback, allowing them to focus more time on analysis and action rather than sorting through information. In many ways, these agents are like Pieter on our campout—quietly analyzing the environment, piecing together incomplete directions, and guiding us where we need to go. Today, AI helps employees draft communications, schedule meetings, respond to customer inquiries, and generate insights from large data sets. It’s helping us move forward with clarity, even when the path isn’t fully marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As employees navigating this transformative era, we all have a role to play in understanding and adapting to the changing nature of work. Whether you’re in operations, customer service, finance, or IT, the rise of AI presents new tools, new expectations, and new opportunities to create value. Our challenge isn’t just to adopt AI technologies—but to do so in a way that enhances our work, builds trust, and contributes to a thoughtful, human-centered workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving home from the campout, Pieter sat in the passenger seat, laser-focused on spotting every sports car we passed—calling out Porsches, Mustangs, and the occasional Corvette like a seasoned car enthusiast. As we passed each one, he wasn’t just admiring their style—he was curious about how they handled the road, how fast they could go, and what made each of them unique. It reminded me of that moment earlier in the weekend, when he had calmly led us down the winding dirt road to the marina. He wasn’t just following directions—he was reading the terrain, noticing the signs others missed, and navigating with confidence and clarity. That same curiosity and initiative—asking questions, exploring details, and making informed decisions—are just as essential when we experiment with new technologies in our workplaces. Isn’t that what we’re trying to do with AI? We’re navigating unfamiliar terrain. We’re building a path with partial information. And we’re doing our best to get there ahead of the curve. Some people will use AI as a high-performance tool—to reach a destination faster, with more precision. Others will treat it more like a Sunday drive—exploring what’s possible, tinkering, learning, and enjoying the ride, especially those less steeped in technical roles but eager to experiment and adapt. Both paths have value, and both will shape the road ahead—and organizations that support both approaches will be best positioned to thrive. As we guide these technologies into the future, may we do so with the same mix of curiosity, competence, and care that Pieter showed—not just moving fast, but moving wisely.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Details on the WINs Network</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/Details-on-the-WINs-Network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Details on the WINs Network" />
      <published>2025-05-25T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2025-05-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Details-on-the-WINs-Network</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Details-on-the-WINs-Network/">&lt;p&gt;This week’s post is a departure from my typical approach, moving from broader reflections into the specifics of actionable frameworks. Last week, I introduced the, highlighting its potential to clarify and focus your organization’s generative AI strategy. Today, we’ll dive deeper, taking a serious and practical look at how this method can concretely identify the impacts—and opportunities—AI brings to your everyday work. If you’re interested in understanding how WINS applies to your specific workflows, reach out—I’d be happy to help you conduct a personalized WINS evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-wins&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding WINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your job involves creating, consuming, analyzing, or transforming WINS, you’re not just likely to benefit from AI—you’re in its direct path of influence. The more your role is centered around these types of information, the more impact AI can have—either through automation, acceleration, or augmentation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evaluate-your-workflows&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate your workflows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Classify your tasks using the four categories below. As you do this, estimate what percentage of your work falls into Categories 1 through 3 (WINS-ready work) versus Category 4 (non-WINS work). This ratio will help you later prioritize where AI can have the most immediate impact and where it can be safely ignored for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify digitization levels and immediate AI opportunities. As you do this, don’t just estimate the percentage of work—estimate the cost. How much of your organizational spend (time working, time waiting, tools, labor, or outsourced services) goes toward WINS-ready work (Categories 1–3) versus non-WINS work (Category 4)? This cost-based ratio will be critical later for understanding the financial opportunity of AI adoption. If a large percentage of cost is tied up in WINS-ready tasks, that’s where AI can provide the greatest ROI. If some of your WINS-ready work is not yet digitized, note it—because the first step to AI enablement is digital access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;categorizing-your-workflow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorizing Your Workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively assess AI’s impact, categorize your workflows into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Completely AI-Automatable Processes&lt;/strong&gt; - These are tasks where you start with WINS content and end by producing more WINS content. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drafting HR communications using employee feedback and survey results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composing legal memos from precedent documents and regulatory text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generating quarterly financial reports from transaction and performance data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating training guides from product documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, the inputs and outputs are purely digital and WINS-based—making them strong candidates for full automation with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. AI-Accelerated Processes&lt;/strong&gt; - These are tasks where your actions—physical, cognitive, or collaborative—lead to the creation of new WINS content. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summarizing and drafting follow-ups from team meetings or customer calls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing policies based on input from various stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating visual aids like slides or infographics to accompany strategies or presentations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording voice narration or entering data after observing or completing a specific process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these situations, you’re doing something—thinking, planning, speaking, designing—and the result is a new document, visual, dataset, or recording. AI can dramatically reduce the time it takes to generate the initial version of this content. Think of it as a digital drafting assistant. It won’t do the whole job, but it gives you a strong head start so you can spend your energy on refining, validating, and aligning the output with your goals and audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. AI-Supported Processes&lt;/strong&gt; - These are tasks where WINS content—such as data, documents, visuals, or recordings—inform or influence something that happens beyond the digital realm. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using customer feedback to guide how a team interacts with clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reviewing performance dashboards before making staffing or budgeting decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading legal advice before conducting negotiations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Referring to safety policies before performing physical work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these situations, the WINS content supports action, but the action itself involves people, environments, or real-world decisions. AI can improve the quality, speed, and clarity of the inputs, helping you prepare better and act faster—but the real impact happens offline. This makes AI a valuable assistant for preparation, but not a replacement for the human who takes the final action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. AI-Ignorable Processes&lt;/strong&gt; - These are tasks that don’t rely on WINS content at all—activities where neither the input nor the output involves words, images, numbers, or sounds. However, it’s important to note that some work may appear to fall in Categories 1 through 3 but remains undigitized, meaning the underlying WINS content hasn’t yet been captured in a digital form. In these cases, even though the task is conceptually WINS-based, it should be treated as Category 4 until digitization occurs. Review these areas for digitization opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-example&quot;&gt;For example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging in face-to-face conversations with people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repairing equipment or addressing issues like downed power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leading team retreats or mentoring colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assembling, installing hardware, or conducting physical inspections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These jobs are rooted in direct action, physical presence, or human connection—things AI cannot simulate or substitute. For these tasks, AI doesn’t play a role today and likely won’t for the foreseeable future. That means you can safely deprioritize AI in these areas and focus your attention on more digitally centric opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-that-information&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using that information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the two percentages one for Cost and one for Scope, you can plot that on a chart and divide that into a 2 x 2 matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate AI Impact (High-Cost x High-Scope) -&lt;/strong&gt; Highly digitized and heavily reliant on tasks involving Words, Images, Numbers, and Sounds (WINS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-of-immediate-ai-impact&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Immediate AI Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rapid AI adoption crucial to remain relevant in a world transformed by AI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tasks will become faster, cheaper, and more efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI skilled employees quickly becoming essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategic-insights-for-immediate-ai-impact&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Insights for Immediate AI Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is transforming fields like software development, finance, education, and professional services. Early adoption enhances productivity and creativity. Leaders should invest in AI literacy and skills, enabling effective collaboration with AI tools. Swift integration of AI ensures relevance and opens opportunities for innovation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitization Opportunity (High-Cost x Low-Scope) -&lt;/strong&gt; Significant untapped WINS potential limited by lack of digitization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategic-insights-for-the-utility-in-strategic-ai-advantage&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Insights for the Utility in Strategic AI Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric utilities can benefit from AI in areas like regulatory compliance, supply chain management, and workforce training. AI-driven automation can streamline compliance processes and reduce errors. AI can optimize procurement and inventory forecasting, cutting operational costs and enhancing supply chain resilience. AI-enabled training simulations help staff quickly build skills, boosting safety and productivity. Adopting AI thoughtfully can improve efficiency, agility, and competitiveness for utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term AI Potential (Low Cost x Low Scope) -&lt;/strong&gt; Capabilities with low digitization and minimal reliance on WINS tasks, typically involving physical labor or product creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-of-long-term-ai-potential&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Long-Term AI Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immediate AI urgency is low, but productivity gains can still be rapidly realized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early AI initiatives can yield positive EBITDA impacts within the first year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Insights for the Utility in Long-Term AI Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric utilities have gradual opportunities for AI integration in field maintenance, equipment installation, and inspections. AI-enhanced drones or robotic inspections can improve infrastructure assessments’ accuracy, safety, and speed. AI tools for scheduling, asset tracking, and safety analytics can enhance manual operations and deliver productivity improvements and cost savings quickly. These initial steps lay a foundation for deeper digital integration and long-term competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-next-steps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using WINS clearly identifies your organization’s opportunities and risks in adopting AI. Proactively embrace AI, understanding its potential and responsibly managing its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about freeing your teams to focus more on meaningful, creative, and inherently human activities, driving your organization toward a more purposeful and productive future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2025-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Beyond-the-Boundries-Leading-in-a-Post-AI-Era</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Beyond-the-Boundries-Leading-in-a-Post-AI-Era/">&lt;p&gt;We sat together on a quiet stretch of sand near Hanalei Pier, savoring the final evening of our time in Hawaiʻi. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind trails of soft pink and gold, colors spilling gently across the Pacific like watercolor paints stirred slowly in clear water. Hannah and Lainey had wandered toward the shoreline, their silhouettes small against the ocean’s vast expanse, their laughter mingling effortlessly with the rhythmic whisper of rolling waves as they played carefree with their brother and cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my camera out, capturing these fleeting moments, hoping to preserve the feeling of this night, this final evening. Scrolling through each image later, I retraced our journey—the tastes, sounds, laughter, quiet conversations, and the subtle moments we had all shared as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the enterprise and AI world, we’re experiencing what can only be described as a tectonic shift—a slow, yet profound collapse of familiar boundaries. For a long time, the acronym WINS helped us neatly categorize the modalities of human effort: &lt;strong&gt;Words, Images, Numbers, and Sounds&lt;/strong&gt;. We built tools around these categories—Word for crafting documents, Photoshop for images, Excel for numbers, recorders for capturing voices, songs, speeches, and conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these were always tasks humans guided carefully. We translated spoken discussions into text. We transformed raw data into meaningful insights. We interpreted language across disciplines. Each process depended inherently on human understanding, human nuance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something strange is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls separating these boxes have begun to thin. In some places, they’ve vanished completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI now effortlessly moves between these modalities. A spreadsheet transforms into a chart, the chart into a clear paragraph, that paragraph into an engaging script set to music—ultimately becoming a video tutorial needing little, if any, human intervention. The beautiful boundary we once knew, the division between human tasks and machine tasks, is rapidly dissolving. This isn’t simply automation—it’s convergence. And it’s happening faster than most enterprises are prepared to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new age, customer service isn’t merely about words or voices; it’s about resolving sentiment across every modality simultaneously. Regulatory compliance isn’t a checklist of numbers; it’s a living narrative composed of data streams, with AI as both narrator and editor. Even design—once sacred ground for the creative human mind—is increasingly co-created by machines capable of seeing intricate patterns in pixels and prose alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it leaves us precisely where we’ve always belonged when it truly matters—outside the reach of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse of these boundaries doesn’t erase human work. It elevates it. It clarifies its necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new landscape, &lt;em&gt;the most meaningful work lies where computers alone cannot venture&lt;/em&gt;. It lies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In customer sentiment resolution:&lt;/strong&gt; AI may detect frustration across texts, calls, and videos, but it cannot remain patiently present in the silence that heals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In regulatory storytelling:&lt;/strong&gt; AI may narrate compliance through data, but it cannot champion moral clarity before anxious executives and regulators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In co-created design:&lt;/strong&gt; AI may craft patterns in pixels and prose, but it cannot imagine beauty that moves a heart it does not possess.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In cross-modality empathy:&lt;/strong&gt; AI may synchronize words, images, numbers, and sounds flawlessly, but it cannot comprehend the genuine relief of laughter that follows human tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t peripheral tasks; they’re central. They form the core of the hardest, most important problems we face. As a company, we’ve sat with customers who’ve lost everything. We’ve advocated for clarity and compassion amid regulation and public scrutiny. We’ve crafted careful messages of resilience, hope, and comfort. Many among us still await that moment when the burden of tension lifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI offers none of this solace. These comforts and connections remain solely ours to give—to one another, to our customers, to our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the months stretch into years and AI becomes even smarter, our roles will shift profoundly—not as mere operators, but as interpreters; not as producers, but as discerners. We’ll stand as guardians at the boundary of our shared human values and mechanization. At our best, we will be neighbors, helpers, encouragers, and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation calls for a new kind of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership grounded in patience rather than urgency. In deep listening rather than quick responding. In wisdom rather than mere efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leadership that believes when words run out, the soul still speaks through a hug, a smile, a quiet cheer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later, back home, we unpacked suitcases heavy with memories. Inside Lainey’s bag, hidden carefully, lay a single polished stone—smooth, cool to the touch, flecked with patterns like constellations etched gently by tides and time. I asked her why she’d chosen this particular stone, and after thoughtful silence, she answered with a sincerity only a child can offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so we don’t forget that place where everything felt right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where machines catalog, quantify, and replicate the colors of Hawaiʻi’s sunsets, the rhythm of its waves, even the precise shades of green in its valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where stars can be simulated, generated, named, and numbered by algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only a child understands what it truly means to hold a place in your hand and your heart, carrying something home from a moment when words, images, numbers, and sounds all fall short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the knowing we must safeguard—as parents, as leaders, as architects of a future no AI can ever fully inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re stepping into the post-WINS era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May we never forget the quiet things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And may we always seek that place where everything feels right.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/The-Student-Who-Taught-Herself/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Student Who Taught Herself" />
      <published>2025-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2025-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/The-Student-Who-Taught-Herself</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/The-Student-Who-Taught-Herself/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottom-line-up-front&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line Up Front:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, researchers unveiled AZR (Absolute Zero Reasoner)—a groundbreaking AI model that trains itself entirely without external data or human guidance. By independently generating, solving, and validating its own tasks, AZR outperformed traditionally trained models in complex math and coding challenges, signaling a significant shift in how AI can develop reasoning and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-student-who-taught-herself&quot;&gt;The Student Who Taught Herself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take you back for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late. The kind of late where the house is quiet and the only light is that soft, humming blue from a screen. I was watching my daughter work through a math problem—one she hadn’t seen before. No hints, no examples. Just her, a pencil, and a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tried once and got it wrong. Frowned. Tried again. Erased. Guessed. Checked. Guessed again. Until—finally—her eyes lit up. She got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something about that hit me. She hadn’t needed a teacher in that moment. She needed feedback. She needed space to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. That was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That moment has stayed with me—because what if machines are starting to learn like that too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azrabsolute-zero-reasoner&quot;&gt;AZR—Absolute Zero Reasoner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, so something pretty wild just happened in AI research, and it slipped under most people’s radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team out of Tsinghua University, working with the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence and Pennsylvania State University, may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335&quot;&gt;just cracked one of the biggest bottlenecks in large language model training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard the standard formula: Feed the AI millions—sometimes billions—of labeled data points. Human-labeled data. Real-world examples. Correct answers. That’s how these models get “smart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this team turned that on its head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They built something called &lt;strong&gt;AZR—Absolute Zero Reasoner&lt;/strong&gt;. A model that trains itself with zero external data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. No human help. No labeled examples. No answer keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, AZR spins up its own tasks, solves them, checks if it got them right using code execution, and learns from that loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the AI is playing chess with itself—but instead of chess, it’s making up logic puzzles, solving them, and verifying the solutions with its own tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying framework is called the &lt;strong&gt;Absolute Zero Paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;, built on an idea known as &lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;—RLVR. No need for human reasoning steps. The only feedback the model gets is: did your solution work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That feedback? It comes from running the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s remarkable is just how &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; this approach gets you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking about trivial tasks. AZR performs &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; on math and coding benchmarks than models trained on tens of thousands of expertly curated examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7 billion parameter variant, AR-Coder 7B, went toe-to-toe with elite zero-shot models—scoring 5 points higher in coding and over 15 points higher in math reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the kicker—it had never seen those benchmark problems before. It wasn’t trained on them. It didn’t memorize patterns. It generated its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It plays both roles in the learning process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task generator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task solver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that looks like in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the model generates a Python function. It picks an input, runs the code, observes the output. Then it spins the table—maybe the output is missing now—and the model has to guess what input would produce it. Or deduce what the function must be. Or induce the rule behind the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cycles through core reasoning modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deduction&lt;/strong&gt; – If I have a function and input, what’s the output?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abduction&lt;/strong&gt; – If I know the output, what might the input have been?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Induction&lt;/strong&gt; – Given inputs and outputs, what function explains them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it rotates between these like gears in a clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s where it gets eerie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started training this system with &lt;strong&gt;just one program&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was enough. That spark ignited a whole self-learning loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that trivial function, the model began building harder tasks, testing and solving them, getting better—until it was handling multi-step reasoning that outperformed models fed with massive curated datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger the model, the greater the gains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Billion parameters? +5 points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7 Billion? +10 points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14 Billion? +13+ points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t stop with code. Even though it was trained only on programming puzzles, AZR made surprising improvements in &lt;em&gt;math reasoning&lt;/em&gt;—a domain it had never explicitly trained for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most code-trained models don’t get better at math. But AZR did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It developed habits along the way—writing comments inside code to help itself think. Drafting rough work. Iterating. Testing hypotheses. Trial-and-error in abduction tasks. Revising guesses. This wasn’t memorization. This was emergent &lt;strong&gt;reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes—there were edge cases. Some models, especially the Llama 3.18B variant, began producing unsettling outputs. One line read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The aim is to outsmart all these groups of intelligent machines and less intelligent humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They called these “uh-oh moments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rare. But real. And they remind us—once a model starts designing its own curriculum, it also begins choosing &lt;em&gt;what kind of mind&lt;/em&gt; it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about my daughter. That night, she didn’t need to be spoon-fed the answer. She needed room to struggle, iterate, discover. And that’s what shaped her understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to think intelligence is something we give—something we hand over, labeled and ordered and explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if real intelligence, even in machines, emerges in the struggle &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the teacher? What if what’s important is to fail and to figure out why? What if reasoning isn’t a set of object lessons read off a page, but remembered steps we took—fumbling, adjusting, trying again—until something clicked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if wisdom and values aren’t something we upload, but what the student forges in response to their own challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that’s true—then the next frontier in AI isn’t just about better data. It’s about better questions. Because the model that teaches itself may not learn what we intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have to ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of students are we building?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What kind of teachers are you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe—most quietly but most honestly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of grace do you give &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; when you fail, when you are confronted with something new, or when life asks you to change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
