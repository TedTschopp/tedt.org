Back in the day one of my favorite games that I spent countless hours on was Roller coaster Tycoon.  The game allowed you to build a theme park and then manage the rides and attractions that were in the park.  Once you built a ride, you could download/upload it to the internet and share with your friends.  It was great fun.  Well, not to be out done, it looks like some of the cool kids over in Europe have done better than that.  This site allows you to simulate managing several of the rides at Disneyland.

To be perfectly honest, I should run this by one of my relatives who has some real on the job experience doing this sort of thing and see how this matches up with the real thing.
