quote: A child kicks his legs rhythmically through excess, not absence, of life. Because
  children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore
  they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ‘Do it again’; and the
  grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not
  strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in
  monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ‘Do it again’ to the sun;
  and every evening, ‘Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity
  that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but
  has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of
  infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.
