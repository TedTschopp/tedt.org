quote: "I would deny\nThe rights of those who terrify\nAnd use as constant tools of\
  \ trade:\n\"Aren't you afraid? Aren't you afraid!\"\nOf what? I ask\n\"Computer!\
  \ aren't they monsters?\nAren't they bad?\"\n\nThat makes me mad, that maddens me.\n\
  The fools! Good grief, they're blind,\nRefuse to find and see\nWhat damned computer\
  \ mean to me!\nTheir digital which perk and hide\ninside electric circuitries\n\
  Provide with ease such medicines\nAs we most need, and find within;\nThey make a\
  \ digitalis!\nGood!!\nWhich sums the substance in the blood\nAnd quickens odd-shaped\
  \ humanoid\nTo fill my void with swift replies.\n\nWhere boredom once let ennui\
  \ in\nComputer says: take heart -- begin!\nMuch more than brute machine I'll be,\
  \ \nAnd constantly your whims attend,\nShow ends where no ends were before;\nAnd,\
  \ more! Show start as well as finishes.\n\nYour Will diminishes at thought of sums?\n\
  So! quick computer this way comes!\nAs out in mystery of Space\nWe race a similar\
  \ mystery: Us, \nAnd need the plus and minor facts\nTo teach reactors how to stride\n\
  And fill lost human souls with pride;\n\nAnd all by, quickly, under breath,\nDo\
  \ Death in with such computations\nAs would force-feed nations of dreams;\nBuild\
  \ schemes on air that ratify\nGrand architectures in the sky--\nWhole cities beehived\
  \ in one ship\nTo solve a trip and save a Race,\nAnd multiple Man's hope in Space.\n\
  \nSo microprocessor takes breath and air\nAnd manufactures rate and simple words\n\
  That aviaries are to boys like birds\nTo fount them high in July rockets\nWhich\
  \ seedpods futures in their pockets;\nDecisions brought from indecisions,\nCollisions\
  \ of free-fall thought fused one,\nThe fun of mathematics nimble\nIn thimbles plug-tamped\
  \ in your ear\nAnd cheerful wisdom played like drum\nOn listening learner's tympanum.\n\
  \nWe are, at last, a traveling feast,\nWith yeast that spawns electrically,\nAnd\
  \ teaches children what they'll be\nIf with tape libraries they keep\nAnd wake the\
  \ processors from sleep,\nTo ask us questions, then stand mum\nAs proper answers\
  \ thrive and sum.\n\nSo, look!\nThis is a book!\nBut no page turns.\nOnly beneath\
  \ the metal burns\nSuch stuffs as all new times are make of.\nSo Cowards, what are\
  \ you afraid of?"
