quote: How can they (i.e. the gods) meet us face to face till we have faces? The idea
  was that a human being must become real before it can expect to receive any message
  from the superhuman; that is, it must be speaking with its own voice (not one of
  its borrowed voices), expressing its actual desires (not what it imagines that it
  desires), being for good or ill itself, not any mask, veil, or persona.
author: C.S. Lewis
