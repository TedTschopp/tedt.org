quote: 'A householder instructs his servants and family in this manner: Deal uprightly
  and honestly, be diligent in that which I command you, and ye may then eat, drink,
  and clothe yourselves as ye please. Even so, our Lord God regards not what we eat,
  drink, or how we clothe ourselves; all such matters, being ceremonies or middle
  things, he leaves freely to us, on the understanding, however, that we ground nothing
  thereon as being necessary to salvation."'
