quote: "If you can keep your head when all about you  \n    Are losing theirs and\
  \ blaming it on you,  \nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n    But\
  \ make allowance for their doubting too;  \nIf you can wait and not be tired by\
  \ waiting,\n    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, don’t\
  \ give way to hating,\n    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:\n \n\
  If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  \n    If you can think—and not\
  \ make thoughts your aim;  \nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n    And\
  \ treat those two impostors just the same;  \nIf you can bear to hear the truth\
  \ you’ve spoken\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\nOr watch the things\
  \ you gave your life to, broken,\n    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:\n\
  \ \nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n    And risk it on one turn of\
  \ pitch-and-toss,\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n    And never breathe\
  \ a word about your loss;\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n   \
  \ To serve your turn long after they are gone,  \nAnd so hold on when there is nothing\
  \ in you\n    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’\n \nIf you can talk\
  \ with crowds and keep your virtue,  \n    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common\
  \ touch,\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n    If all men count\
  \ with you, but none too much;\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n    With\
  \ sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  \nYours is the Earth and everything that’s\
  \ in it,  \n    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!"
