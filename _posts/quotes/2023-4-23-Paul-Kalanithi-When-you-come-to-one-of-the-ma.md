quote: When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account
  for yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the
  world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated
  joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more
  and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.
