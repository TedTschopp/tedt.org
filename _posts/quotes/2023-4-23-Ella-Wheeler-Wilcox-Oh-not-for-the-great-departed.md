quote: "Oh, not for the great departed\nWho formed our country’s laws,\nAnd not for\
  \ the bravest-hearted\nWho died in freedom’s cause;\nAnd not for some living hero,\n\
  To whom all bend the knee,\nMy muse shall raise her song of praise,\nBut for the\
  \ Man to be.\nFor out of the strife which women\nAre passing through today,\nA man\
  \ that is more than human\nShall surely be born, I say;\nA man in whose pure spirit\n\
  No dross of self will lurk,\nA man who is strong to cope with wrong,\nA Man who\
  \ is proud to work.\nA man with hope undaunted,\nA man with God-like power,\nShall\
  \ come when he is wanted,\nShall come at the needed hour.\nHe shall silence the\
  \ din and clamor\nOf clan disputing clan,\nAnd toil’s long fight with purse-proud\
  \ might\nShall triumph through this Man.\nI know he is coming, coming,\nTo help,\
  \ to guide, to save.\nThough I hear no martial drumming\nAnd see no flags that wave.\n\
  But the great soul-travail of woman,\nAnd the bold, free thought unfurled,\nAnd\
  \ heralds that say he is on the way,\nThe coming Man of the world.\nMourn not for\
  \ the vanished ages\nWith their grand, heroic men,\nWho dwell in history’s pages\n\
  And live in the poet’s pen.\nFor the grandest times are before us,\nAnd the world\
  \ is yet to see\nThe noblest work of this old earth\nIn the Men that are to be."
