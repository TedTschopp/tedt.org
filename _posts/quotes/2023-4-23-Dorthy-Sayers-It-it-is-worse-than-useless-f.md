quote: '"It it is worse than useless for Christians to talk about the importance of
  Christian morality, unless they are prepared to take their stand upon the fundamentals
  of Christian theology. It is a lie to say that dogma does not matter; it matters
  enormously. It is fatal to let people suppose that Christianity is only a mode of
  feeling; it is vitally necessary to insist that it is first and foremost a rational
  explanation of the universe. It is hopeless to offer Christianity as a vaguely idealistic
  aspiration of a simple and consoling kind; it is, on the contrary, a hard, tough,
  exacting, and complex doctrine, steeped in a drastic and incompromising realism.
  And it is fatal to imagine that everybody knows quite well what Christianity is
  and needs only a little encouragement to practice it. The brutal fact is that in
  this Christian country not one person in a hundred has the faintest notion what
  the Church teaches about God or man or society or the person of Jesus Christ….  …Theologically
  this country is at present is in a state of utter chaos established in the name
  of religious toleration and rapidly degenerating into flight from reason and the
  death of hope.  "'
