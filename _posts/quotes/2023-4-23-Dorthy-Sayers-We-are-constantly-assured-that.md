quote: "We are constantly assured that the churches are empty because preachers insist\
  \ too much upon doctrine — ‘dull dogma,’ as people call it. The fact is the precise\
  \ opposite. It is the neglect of dogma that makes for dullness. The Christian faith\
  \ is the most exciting drama that ever staggered the imagination of man — and the\
  \ dogma is the drama.\n\nThis is the dogma we find so dull — this terrifying drama\
  \ which God is the victim and the hero. If this is dull, then what, in Heaven’s\
  \ name, is worthy to be called exciting? The people who hanged Christ never, to\
  \ do them justice, accused Him of being a bore — on the contrary; they thought Him\
  \ too dynamic to be safe. It has been left for later generations to muffle up that\
  \ shattering personality and surround Him with an atmosphere of tedium. We have\
  \ very efficiently pared the claws of the Lion of Judah, certifying Him ‘meek and\
  \ mild,’ and recommended Him as a fitting household pet for pale curates and pious\
  \ old ladies."
