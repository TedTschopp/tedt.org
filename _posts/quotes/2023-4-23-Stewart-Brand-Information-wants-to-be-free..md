quote: Information wants to be free. Information also wants to be expensive. Information
  wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine
  — too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable
  to the recipient. That tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate
  about price, copyright, ‘intellectual property’, the moral rightness of casual distribution,
  because each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.
