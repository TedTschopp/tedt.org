quote: "• Anything you buy, you must maintain. A purchase is just the beginning.\n\
  You can expect to devote as much money/time in maintaining a technology as\nyou\
  \ did in acquiring and installing it.\n• Acquire at the last possible moment. Technologies\
  \ improve so fast you\nshould postpone getting anything until 5 minutes before you\
  \ need it. Then\naccept the fact that anything you buy is already obsolete.\n• You\
  \ will be newbie forever. Get good at the beginner mode: learning new\nprograms,\
  \ asking dumb questions, making stupid mistakes, soliciting help.\n• Often learning\
  \ a new tool requires unlearning old ones. The habits of\nusing a land line phone\
  \ don't work in email or cell phone. The habits of\nemail don't work in twitter.\
  \ The habits of twitter won't work in what is\nnext. Try to leave the old habits\
  \ behind when venturing to new forms.\n• Take sabbaticals. Once a week let go of\
  \ your tools. Once a year take a\nbreak from the whole system gracefully. Once in\
  \ your life step back\ncompletely and turn everything off until your soul says to\
  \ turn it back on.\nYou'll return with renewed enthusiasm and perspective.\n• Keep\
  \ it easy to switch. You will leave the tool you are using today at\nsome time in\
  \ the near future. How easy will it be to leave? If leaving\nforces you to leave\
  \ all your data behind, or to learn a new way of typing,\nor to surrender four other\
  \ technologies you were still using, then maybe\nthis is not the best one to start.\n\
  \n• Quality is not always related to price. Sometimes expensive gear is\nbetter,\
  \ sometimes the least expensive is best for you. Most folks don’t\never use the\
  \ premium features they paid for. And 95% of most tools are\nabandonded before they\
  \ wear out. Quality is related to your personal use.\n• For every expert opinion\
  \ that you find online, seek out an equal but\nopposite expert opinion somewhere\
  \ else. Don’t rely on  raves only.  If you\nhave not heard any negatives, you have\
  \ not yet found all the opinions.\n• You don’t need to understand the mechanics\
  \ of a new technology before you\nstart using it.  The best way to understand it\
  \ is to use it.\n• Tools are metaphors that shape how you think. What embedded assumptions\n\
  does the new tool make? Does it assume right-handedness, or literacy, or a\npassword,\
  \ or a place to throw it away? Where the defaults are set can\nreflect a tool's\
  \ bias. You should ask yourself what does this technology\nassume?\n• What other\
  \ thing do you give up? This one has taken me a long time to\nlearn. The only way\
  \ to take up a new technology is to reduce an old one in\nmy life already. Social\
  \ media, for instance, must come at the expense of\nsomething else I was doing --\
  \ even if it just daydreaming.\n• Every new technology will bite back. The more\
  \ powerful its gifts, the\nmore powerfully it can be abused. Look for its costs.\n\
  • Risks are relative. The risks of a new technology can’t be evaluation\nalone;\
  \ they must be compared to the risks of the older technology, or no\ntechnology.\
  \ For instance the risks of a new dental MRI must be compared to\nthe risks of an\
  \ old x-ray, or to the risks of no x-ray and getting\ncavities. The costs of the\
  \ new must be compared to costs of the old.\n• Be suspicious of any technology that\
  \ requires walls to prevent access. If\nyou can’t fix it, modify it or hack it yourself,\
  \ that is a  sign.\n* Teaching others what you learn (like posting solutions to\
  \ things you\nfigured out) is the best way to keep learning about a technology yourself.\n\
  • The proper response to a stupid technology is not to outlaw it but to\nmake a\
  \ better one yourself, just as the proper response to a stupid idea is\nnot to outlaw\
  \ it but to replace it with a better idea.\n• Nobody has any idea of what a new\
  \ invention will really be good for,\nincluding its inventors. You can’t evaluate\
  \ new things by merely thinking\nabout them. To evaluate, try it, then think.\n\
  • The second order effects of technology usually only arrive when everyone\nhas\
  \ one, or it is present everywhere. Drones are cool, but what if everyone\nhas one\
  \ hovering over their shoulder?\n• The older the technology, the more likely it\
  \ will continue to be useful.\nIt may need to find a more limited new job, but don’t\
  \ dismiss it. Some of\nthe best new things are old things re-imagined.\n• Find the\
  \ minimum amount of technology that will maximize your options.\uFEFF"
