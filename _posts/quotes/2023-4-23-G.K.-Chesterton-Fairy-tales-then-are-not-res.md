quote: 'Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or
  any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil
  or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy
  tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child
  is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the
  dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides
  for him is a St. George to kill the dragon. Exactly what the fairy tale does is
  this: it accustoms him for a series of clear pictures to the idea that these limitless
  terrors had a limit, that these shapeless enemies have enemies in the knights of
  God, that there is something in the universe more mystical than darkness, and stronger
  than strong fear.'
