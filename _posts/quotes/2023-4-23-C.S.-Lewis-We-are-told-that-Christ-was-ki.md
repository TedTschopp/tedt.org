quote: "We are told that Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed out our\
  \ sins, and that by dying He has disabled death itself. That is the formula. That\
  \ is Christianity. That is what has to be believed. Any theories we build up as\
  \ to how Christ's death did all this are, in my view, quite secondary: mere plans\
  \ or diagrams to be left alone if they do not help us, and, if they do help us,\
  \ not to be confused with the thing itself."
