quote: In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating.
  It's the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further
  from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation
  that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
