quote: "Anyone who sees a hurricane coming should warn others. I see a hurricane coming.\n\
  Over the next generation or two, ever larger numbers of people, hundreds of millions,\
  \ will become immersed in virtual worlds and online games. While we are playing,\
  \ things we used to do on the outside, in “reality,” won’t be happening anymore,\
  \ or won’t be happening in the same way. You can’t pull millions of person-hours\
  \ out of a society without creating an atmospheric-level event.\nIf it happens in\
  \ a generation, I think the twenty-first century will see a social cataclysm larger\
  \ than that caused by cars, radios, and TV, combined… . The exodus of these people\
  \ from the real world, from our normal daily life, will create a change in social\
  \ climate that makes global warming look like a tempest in a teacup."
