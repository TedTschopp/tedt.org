description: This evocative poem explores themes of time, forgiveness, and the human
    quest for redemption. Through imagery of the ocean, sand, and a journey into the
    west, the poet conveys a sense of longing, reflection, and peaceful acceptance
    of life's inevitable end.

Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

Crashing waves and pounding surf  

Tonight's the night we leave this earth

* * *

Companions brave our task complete.  

Some come to live, some come to sleep.  

But on my knees I come today

Forgiveness asked and penance paid.

* * *

As we depart this earthly sphere  

I search myself for pride and fear:  

A sadness now, a twinge of guilt  

As glories fade and triumphs wilt.

* * *

Straight is our path into the west  

Straight is our journey and our quest  

The course is set, our way secure:  

Old burdens heavy, old hearts now pure.

* * *

Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

A whispering breeze, a swan in flight,  

A world awaking, an end to night.
