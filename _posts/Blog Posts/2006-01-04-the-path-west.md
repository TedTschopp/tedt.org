Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

Crashing waves and pounding surf  

Tonight's the night we leave this earth

* * *

Companions brave our task complete.  

Some come to live, some come to sleep.  

But on my knees I come today

Forgiveness asked and penance paid.

* * *

As we depart this earthly sphere  

I search myself for pride and fear:  

A sadness now, a twinge of guilt  

As glories fade and triumphs wilt.

* * *

Straight is our path into the west  

Straight is our journey and our quest  

The course is set, our way secure:  

Old burdens heavy, old hearts now pure.

* * *

Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

A whispering breeze, a swan in flight,  

A world awaking, an end to night.
