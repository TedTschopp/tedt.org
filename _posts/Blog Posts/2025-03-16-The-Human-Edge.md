In the quiet stillness of morning, as the sun casts its gentle glow over Southern California, you find yourselves at the cusp of a new era. The world around you is shifting, reshaped by the relentless march of artificial intelligence. From the bustling factories of China to the serene halls of hospitals, AI's touch is both profound and pervasive.

Imagine, for a moment, a factory floor bathed in the soft hum of machinery, where not a single human footstep echoes. This is the reality in Changping, where [Xiaomi's fully automated, AI-driven facility](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/manufacturing/chinese-companys-dark-factory-will-no-human-workers-soon-be-the-norm/news-story/9468c5bc380108deba4e55a95d6c28d4) operates tirelessly, crafting smartphones with precision and speed. It's a testament to human ingenuity, yet it raises a poignant question: What becomes of the human hands that once toiled here? The workers at the previous factories wanted these jobs because they were much higher paying then the others that were available to them.  This overall presents a difficult question, about the future of employment and the delicate balance between innovation and livelihood.

In the realm of healthcare, AI strides forward with both promise and controversy. [Hospitals now introduce AI nurses](https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-nurses-hospitals-health-care-3e41c0a2768a3b4c5e002270cc2abe23) like Ana, designed to alleviate the burdens of human caregivers.  While these digital assistants offer respite from burnout and understaffing, they also spark debates about the essence of care. Can an AI replicate the warmth of a human touch, the empathy in a nurse's voice? As nursing unions voice their concerns, we are reminded that technology, for all its wonders, must be wielded with wisdom and compassion.

Yet, amidst these transformations, there are stories that stir the soul. [At UC San Francisco, a paralyzed man reaches out](https://people.com/scientists-create-robotic-arm-that-paralyzed-man-can-control-with-his-thoughts-11697185), not with his limbs, but with his thoughts. Through a brain-computer interface, he controls a robotic arm, reclaiming a semblance of independence. It's a dance of neurons and circuits, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the potential of AI to heal and empower.

In the corridors of business, AI's influence is equally profound. [JPMorgan Chase reports that an AI coding assistant has elevated software engineers' productivity by up to 20%](https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/business/jpmorgan-credits-coding-assistant-tool-for-boosting-engineers-efficiency/). This symbiotic relationship amplifies human creativity through machine efficiency, allowing IT professionals to address complex challenges previously left unattended. As we embrace these tools, we must reflect on the evolving nature of work and the skills we value. Are we prepared to adapt, learn, and redefine our roles in this changing landscape?​

At a recent private conference, [OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discussed AI's deflationary potential](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-ai-gpu-private-conference-morgan-stanley-2025-3), noting that decreasing costs to access and use generative AI models are benefiting developers and businesses. This underscores the importance of adapting to technological advancements in the AI landscape.​

[Niantic, the creator of Pokémon Go, is charting a new course towards AI and GIS](https://nianticlabs.com/news/niantic-next-chapter?hl=en). By spinning off its gaming division and forming Niantic Spatial, the company aims to develop a comprehensive geospatial model of the Earth. Leveraging data from millions of game players, Niantic seeks to build a ground-level map that can perceive and interact with the physical world, laying the foundation for advanced location-based services. This ambitious endeavor underscores the evolving role of AI in bridging the digital and physical realms.​

You stand at the forefront of this revolution. The question before you is not whether AI will change what we do, but how you will adapt to its inevitable influence. Will you embrace the tools that enhance your capabilities, or resist the tide of change? This year, consider how you can integrate AI into your workflows, upskill to meet new demands, and ensure that, amidst the algorithms and automation, the human element remains central.

In this spring season of transformation, growth, and renewal, let us move forward with spped, thoughtfulness and intention, crafting a future where technology serves humanity, and not the other way around.
