Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

Crashing waves and pounding surf  

Tonight's the night we leave this earth




Companions brave our task complete.  

Some come to live, some come to sleep.  

But on my knees I come today

Forgiveness asked and penance paid.




As we depart this earthly sphere  

I search myself for pride and fear:  

A sadness now, a twinge of guilt  

As glories fade and triumphs wilt.




Straight is our path into the west  

Straight is our journey and our quest  

The course is set, our way secure:  

Old burdens heavy, old hearts now pure.




Slowly slip the sands of time  

Past my fingers, through my hands.  

A whispering breeze, a swan in flight,  

A world awaking, an end to night.
