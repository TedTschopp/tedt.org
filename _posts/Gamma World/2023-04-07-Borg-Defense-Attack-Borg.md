description: This 3 meter diameter sphere has a 1 meter turret on top and two 6 meter
  long tentacles. It also has a 100 Hit Point Energy Screen and twin tractor/pressor
  beams that can move 500 kilograms at a 60-meter range. Its main weapons are 3 batteries
  of 5 Lasers each. All 3 batteries can be fired at once and they have a 900 meter
  range and do 20d6 damage per battery. Other weapons include 3 Grenade Launchers
  with 4d10 Grenades each of mixed types (all launchers can be fired simultaneously)
  and 2 Micro-missile Launchers with 2d20 missiles apiece (which must be fired separately).
  Grenade Launchers have a 300 meter range and Micro-missiles have a 3000 meter range.
  A Defense Borg may make additional attacks by dividing his attack rank between various
  attacks, However, his Rank decrease as his Endurance decreases from damage (loss
  of 1 per 4 hit points of damage).A Rarity has been found of a Defense Borg whose
  brain has mutated and possess one mental mutation.
