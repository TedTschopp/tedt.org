description: 'The few expeditions that have made it to the lunar surface and back
  tell dreadful tales of the strange life forms that developed after the inhabitants
  of Tycho Center, the Moons only manned base, were slain by disease. (See A World
  Gone Mad, DRAGONissue #86, and A Field Guide To Lunar Mutants," DRAGON issue #87.)
  One of the mutant plants now found at Tycho Center is the so-called blaster blossom,
  a mutant orchid.The blaster blossom is a reactive mutant, using its powers whenever
  it is touched. It has two attacks. The first is a spore cloud (treated as intensity
  17 con- tact poison) that can slay victims with relative ease. This is fired whenever
  anything touches the blossom. The sec- ond attack is a actually a series of ran-
  dom energy attacks, fired whenever any metallic object (such as a robot) touches
  the plant. In a random manner, it will use one of the following attacks (roll1d4,
  one attack for one action turn):1) inflict 3d10 heat damage up to 3 m from the blossoms
  flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it; 2) fire an electrical
  bolt doing 2d26 damage up to 10 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction
  of the thing that touched it;3) fire an energy-draining bolt that instantly reduces
  all power cells within 5 m of the blossom to half energy; or,4) energy negation
  activated for 2-20 action turns, within a 15 m radius. If the spores ever kill the
  creature who touched the plant, they will grow in the dead body and become 1-3 new
  blaster blossoms within three days.'
