Mission: ''
Description: Rakrods are mutated cousins of the common white labrotory rat.  They
  are 30 centimeters long and have lost their tails.  Located in the middle of its
  forehead is an 8 centimeter long horn that is tipped with a poisionous barb
Equipment: Rakrods are unconcerned with technology or equipment.  They will scavange
  for food and nest material, thus shredding material in their hunt for these materials.
Reactions: If the barb on their horn is broken off during combat it will take grow
  a new one.  If a rakrod's barb is removed before its use (or within 2 actions after
  its death), it maintains its poison and can be used for many purposes in addition
  to the obvsious applicaiton as a dart in a blowgun.

New_Description: ''
Combat: The Rakrod wields the horn with amazing precision.  They get a +4 to hit with
  this weapon (making their base attack at -1+4=3).  On a sucessful hit there is a
  50% chance that the poison barb also hits the target and sticks (I7).  The Rakrod
  can only inject the poson barb once as it sticks in its victim.
