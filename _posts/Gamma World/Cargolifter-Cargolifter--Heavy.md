description: A Mutated thornbush that is neither a horse nor a cactus.  The Pinetos
  has a horizontal trunk and thick leg stalks giving it a equine appearance.  This
  is increaed by way the pineto dips its roots to take in water by lowering its 'head'
  to drink.  The compairson to a cacuts comes from the sharp thorns entirely covering
  the plant.  These thorns make it impossible to ride without a saddle.  A sharp prod
  must be jammed between trunk and the root ball.  They are extremely valueable as
  mounts, and it is very difficult to catch them and then even harder to tame them.  However
  those that are are considered excellent mounts.
