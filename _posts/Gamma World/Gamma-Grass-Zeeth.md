description: Zeeth are blades of purple grass that grow up to a meter tall. Mature
  zeeth have tassles like other grasses.

reactions: ''
behavior: When one or more warm-blooded entities approach within 30 meters of this
  grass, the individual stalks will each try to teleport 25% of their seeds into the
  bodies of those that approached the grass.  Seeds that miss will drop to the ground
  dead.  Those that enter the body cause damage immediately and secrete dissolving
  juices that cause Progressive damage (+1d) per day for seven days.  If the victim
  is not dead, the seed will no longer be viable.  Damage from the Zeethh can not
  be healed until the seed has been removed.  If the host dies while infected, the
  seeds cause a Zeeth to sprout from the body within an hour and the blades grow tassles
  within three days.  Teleported seeds are replaced at a rate of one per day.  If
  there is more than one target in range, a field of Zeeth will attack everyone within
  range impartially.

combat: "Zeeth have a unique means of reproduction: they can sense the presence of\
  \ warm-blooded creatures within 20 meters. When they sense one, they attempt to\
  \ teleport their seeds into the creatures body. The zeeth must make a Willpower\
  \ feat check, opposed by the character's Willpower Resistance Modifier. If successful,\
  \ it has implanted one or more seeds. The character feels a sharp pain, but suffers\
  \ no damage initially. Treat the seeds as a disease with a strength based on the\
  \ zeeth's success with its Willpower feat check (so if the zeeth got a Good result,\
  \ the seeds are Good strength). After the onset time, the character must make a\
  \ Constitution feat check, modified by the strength of the seeds. If the character\
  \ recovers, his body has rejected and destroyed the seeds. A victim that dies becomes\
  \ host to a new cluster of zeeth, which sprout from the corpse."
society: Zeeth are usually found in clumps or clusters on open plains and clearings
  in temperate environments. They go to seed in summer, dying out in the autumn and
  winter, with new zeeth sprouting from their hosts in the spring.
