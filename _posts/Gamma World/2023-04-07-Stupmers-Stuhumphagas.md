description: These gigantic, kindly natured tortoises roam radioactive deathlands
  and other dry, desolate places. They are always willing to telepathically talk to
  any intelligent creature, and gener- ally try to help anyone in trouble or need.
  The only exception here is a dagmit. This is understandable, since dagmits kill
  and eat stuhumphagas whenever they can, and make their homes out of the empty shells.When
  a stuhumphagus is attacked, it immediately withdraws into its shell. It is able
  to pull the undershell shut so that it is completely protected. In this state, most
  attacks can only hit the shell (which is still AC 3). Thrusting and slashing weapons,
  such as spears, arrows, and all but two- handed swords, do not harm the shell even
  if they hit. Cutting and crushing weapons, such as axes, two-handed swords, and
  maces do full damage to the shell, which can take damage equal to the stuhumphaguss
  hit-point total before splitting open. Damage from energy attacks such as sonic
  blast and heat gener- ation are split evenly between the shell and the tortoise
  inside, but lasers and energy weapons do their damage to the shell only. Blasters
  treat the shell as nonliv- ing matter  they put a 10-cm hole in it.The tortoise
  relies on its defenses as long as it can, and saves stunning force for cases of
  absolute necessity, even though it can use that mutation three times per day. A
  stuhumphagus uses thought imitation when attacked with a mental mutation.Stuhumphagas
  have extra room in their shells; one can carry three human-sized creatures. A stuhumphagus
  can carry or house friendly, intelligent creatures in its shell at need. The passengers
  gain all of the shells protection, including immunity to radiation outside. Stuhumphagas
  sometimes carry Healers through deserts and deathlands, functioning as small mobile
  hospitals. Stuhumphagas need very little food and water to survive (considering
  their bulk), but they always know where safe food and water can be found. Stu- humphagas
  weigh approximately 25 met- ric tons each. If one steps on a smaller creature (something
  they never do inten- tionally, even to a dagmit, and something they certainly cannot
  do as an attack in combat), the victim takes 2d6 hp damage. Stuhumphagas heal all
  damage to their shells at the same rate as they heal dam- age to their bodies. No
  known medicine can speed up the process.

behavior: These worms absorb the minerals and metals emitted by the vents they live
  near and so have iron and zinc based 'teeth' used to kill prey (this can rip through
  some metals). They still use the bacteria that their deeper dwelling cousins use,
  but now also add fresh meat when available. They build a case out of the metals
  captured from the vent(s) and only come out to feed or to collect more nutrients
  from the hot water.  The hot water they dwell in inflicts between d6 and 6d10 points
  of damage depending on the temperature (190 F to 600 F) and the protection the diver
  has.  When a worm retreats inside its sheath it has an AC increased to 5.
