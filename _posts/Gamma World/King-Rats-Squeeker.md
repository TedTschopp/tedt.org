new_description: Looking like nothing more than grossly overgrown brownish or rust-colored
  rats, Squeekers are easily identified by the shrill, painful cries they make in
  combat. Of course by this time the knowledge may come to late to save the intended
  victim.
combat: Squeekers are pack animals, taking their prey by surrounding and overwhelming
  the target. Although vicious and quite capable of causing serious harm, Squeekers
  have never been known for their courage.  When hunting, they single out weak or
  isolated targets that can easily be pulled down. Their most common hunting tactic
  is to stealthily surround the victim and then rush out all at once, directing their
  sonic  blast attacks at the target.  If the civtim is still standing, they then
  attack with their bite, clinging to the animal until it is pulled down by the weight
  of their numbers.  If their dinner puts up strong resistance, they will circle it
  at a safe sitance, hoping to wear the target down by repeasted lunges.  If this
  does not work or help arrives, the Squeekers flee in all directions.
society: Squeekers can be found in any terrain, but are most frequently encountered
  near settlements, lurking around garbage pits, or close to the lair of larger creatures.  They
  prey on passerby or scavenger food from the waste of others.  Their dens are usually
  a small complex of underground tunnels with several shambers and exists.  Squeekers
  can be domesticated somewhat and trained to severlike guard dogs and hunting animals.  This
  requires that they be trained from birth and even then can only be accomplished
  by those immune to their sonic blast mutation.  Hissers, in particular, keep pens
  of the animals for use both in the hunt and as food.  Indeed it is likely that the
  hisser immunity to sonic blasts developed slowly from a close relationship Squeekers.
