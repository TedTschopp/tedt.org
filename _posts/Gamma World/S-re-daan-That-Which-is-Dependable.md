Description: The S're'dan is a mutated ant eater.  It has a barrel-chest with a bright
  red-mane covering much of its entire body.  It is within this mane that the rider
  travels.  It has a thick, 3 foot tail and a bony head with a horn on it.  The S're'dan
  has large sad looking brown eyes.  The S're'dan is an insectivore and uses its long,
  purple tongue to eat as it travels and therefore doesn't need to rest often as long
  as there are bugs for it to eat.

Behavior: The S're'dan is an extremely hardy mount and are quite peaceful.  They can
  be trained to bite and attack with their horn on command.  If they charge a target
  they will double any normal damage done via a charge attack.  They have an extremely
  good sense of smell and can track scents.  If a character owns a S're'dan for a
  long period of time it will become devoted to them.  There have been many recorded
  cases where a S're'dan will burrow under a fallen master, work them onto its back
  and return back to the settlement with them.  S're'daan prefer plains and verldlands.
