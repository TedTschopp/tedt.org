new_description: Jagers are mutated jungle cats who have migrated into the open plains.
  Although they are not very intelligent, they have reached the level of basic tool
  use and ran manipulate objects with their forepaws. The typical jaget is about a
  meter and a half long and weighs about 50 kilograms. A jaget's coat is stippled
  with dark stripes or spots over a yellowish base. Jagers prefer to travel on all
  fours and rarely wear anything or carry any objects or tools with them.
combat: Jagets avoid combat with foes much larger than themselves, but occasionally
  cooperate to pull down a large animal. A single human-sized opponent may be attacked
  by a lone jaget, but the savannah cats generally pursue smaller and safer game.
  Jagets attack with two claws and a bite. If hunung together, the cats will often
  use their fear generation ability to drive prey towards the waiting pride. Jagets
  will attempt to use their intuition abilities in combat, gaining a + 2 THAC with
  a successful MP roll.
society: The savannah cats are a wide-ranging race of hunters. Their intelligence
  is barely above the animal, and their lives revolve about the hunt. On the open
  plain, they usually live in family groups, which cooperate in the taking of prey
  and the defense of the group. Families are composed of a mated pair and one or two
  young or subadults. Their telepathic and intuitive abilities make it nearly impossible
  to surprise a group of cats, and also make the jagets skilled stalkers. Rarely,
  savannah cats are found wandering alone far from their homelands as the compan10ns
  of other creatures. Usually this is because, due to their substantial mental powers,
  jagets are often desired as followers or hirelings of other species. Jagets love
  bright, shiny objects and often slip into human camps to pilfer small artifacts.
