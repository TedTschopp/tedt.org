description: "The few expeditions that have made it to the lunar surface and back\
  \ tell dreadful tales of the strange life forms that developed after the inhabitants\
  \ of Tycho Center, the Moons only manned base, were slain by disease. (See A World\
  \ Gone Mad, DRAGONissue #86, and A Field Guide To Lunar Mutants,' DRAGON issue #87.)\
  \ One of the mutant plants now found at Tycho Center is the so-called blaster blossom,\
  \ a mutant orchid.The blaster blossom is a reactive mutant, using its powers whenever\
  \ it is touched. It has two attacks. The first is a spore cloud (treated as intensity\
  \ 17 con- tact poison) that can slay victims with relative ease. This is fired whenever\
  \ anything touches the blossom. The sec- ond attack is a actually a series of ran-\
  \ dom energy attacks, fired whenever any metallic object (such as a robot) touches\
  \ the plant. In a random manner, it will use one of the following attacks (roll1d4,\
  \ one attack for one action turn):1) inflict 3d10 heat damage up to 3 m from the\
  \ blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it; 2) fire\
  \ an electrical bolt doing 2d26 damage up to 10 m from the blossoms flower stalk,\
  \ in the direction of the thing that touched it;3) fire an energy-draining bolt\
  \ that instantly reduces all power cells within 5 m of the blossom to half energy;\
  \ or,4) energy negation activated for 2-20 action turns, within a 15 m radius. If\
  \ the spores ever kill the creature who touched the plant, they will grow in the\
  \ dead body and become 1-3 new blaster blossoms within three days."

behavior: These vicious, carnivorous humanoids are active day and night, using their
  radar to locate prey they cant see.  Dagmits are small (usually 80 cm tall and broad
  in proportion), but very dense (up to 200 kg).  This density increase is constant
  in dagmits from birth, and they cannot control it. It gives them a good armor class
  and makes them proof against all hurled and nonpowered missile weapons, needlers,
  and the claws and teeth of any creature with fewer than 16 HD. Nonpowered edged
  weapons, such as axes and swords, are blunted (-2 to hit, -1 hp damage until sharpened)
  on an attack roll of 1 of 2 against a dagmit. Despite their extreme density, dagmits
  have retained the ability to move and fight at near-normal speeds, although their
  dexterity is low and they cannot run as fast as unburdened Pure Strain Humans.   Serfs
  sometimes enslave small numbers of dagmits.  All artifacts make them uneasy, and
  they use only Tech Level I weapons them- selves  notably spears, javelins, blow-
  guns, bolas, and slings with stones. The blowguns are equipped with insinuative
  poison needles of poison intensity 9.

combat: They attack almost anything that moves, but are terrified of large, self-propelled
  machines such as robots and vehicles (they do not usually recognize androids as
  machines until too late, however).
