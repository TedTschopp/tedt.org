behavior: Anyone stepping on it must make a DX check at 02 or slip and fall (1 damage).  Once
  a large creatuer falls in the water, the shinarl will release an acidic poison in
  the water that will imediately spread over the surface.  This clear acidic poison
  can seep into any armor except completly sealed suit (it ingores AC).  It damages
  both through its acidic properties (I8) and through it spoisnous properties (I8).    Shinarl
  can be harmed only by radioactivity, electricity, sonic, stun, or chemical defoliants.
