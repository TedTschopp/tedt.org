Description: ''
Equipment: Skyzorr'n usually use Tech Level II devices and weapons, except for the
  sacred warriors which often have Tech Level III weapons.
Reactions: ''
Behavior: The Skyzorr'n have a rigid class structure that is kept intact by the physical
  descriptions, abilities, and purposes of each level. The Skyzorr'n queen is the
  leader of the colony and mother of future Skyzorr'n. The queen's body is so huge
  she looks like a giant spider at first glance. She is in constant contact with different
  members of the colony and, since she is always located in the center of the colony
  and is well protected, it is almost impossible to sneak up on her without teleporting
  to the spot. Her function in life is to direct the colony in its expansion and to
  mate with a sacred warrior and thus provide young Skyzorr'n every year. If she gives
  birth to a new queen (50% chance at any birth), she will drive it and all the young
  Skyzorr'n out after a year so that they will start their own colony. The only exception
  to chis is when the queen is too old, and then the new queen kills her and takes
  control of the colony. The average lifespan of a queen is 250 years, compared with
  100 years for a lesser Skyzorr'n. Skyzorr'n queens are notorious for their love
  of expensive items. Knowledge of appraisal has been passed down from generation
  to generation and a queen can estimate an item's worth easily. All queens have quite
  a hoard , but it is exceptionally well guarded. It is rumored that there is a Queen
  Prime on Gamma World, the queen of the queens who mentally keeps in contact with
  her subjects and directs their world-conquering plans and operations. No proof has
  been brought forth concerning this yet.

New_Description: Skyzorr'n are mutated giant ants that walk erect, have large mandibles
  they use as tools or weapons, and have four arms (all controllable at once to some
  degree). Skyzorr'n can be found almost anywhere except cold climes;  they are constantly
  sending scouts and explorers out to bring back information on possible new areas
  to colonize. Skyzorr'n are most often encountered in forests, the tropics, grasslands,
  and underground, but can go anywhere their interest takes them.
Combat: All Skyzorr'n have Sarbis phobia, a dreaded fear of the Sarbis race (probably
  an ancient race memory of ant-eating aardvarks). When a Sarbis appears on the scene,
  Skyzorr'n will operate at a - 3 CS penalty (or at - 30, whichever is appropriate).
Society: No other race gets along well with the Skyzorr'n; they are fierce, warlike
  beings who believe it is their destiny to one day rule Gamma World. They belong
  to no cryptic alliances and owe allegiance only to their own race and destiny. This
  does not mean that they are isolationists; the Skyzorr'n frequently trade with merchants
  and other races for the treasure their queen desires. Skyzorr'n peons or warriors
  are often hired out as guards or workers in exchange for payment. This also gives
  the queen a way of gaining information and keeping track of the activities of other
  societies.
