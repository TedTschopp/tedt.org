description: A Mutated thornbush that is neither a horse nor a cactus.  The Pinetos
  has a horizontal trunk and thick leg stalks giving it a equine appearance.  This
  is increaed by way the pineto dips its roots to take in water by lowering its "head"
  to drink.  The compairson to a cacuts comes from the sharp thorns entirely covering
  the plant.  These thorns make it impossible to ride without a saddle.  A sharp prod
  must be jammed between trunk and the root ball.  They are extremely valueable as
  mounts, and it is very difficult to catch them and then even harder to tame them.  However
  those that are are considered excellent mounts.

new_description: The horse cacti is both a horse and cactus in name only. It is in
  actually a mobile cactus-like plant with behaviors in many ways resembling a horse.
  The plant has a large, horizontal central trunk which is supported by either four
  or six thick, stubby stalks which act as legs. These legs can propel the creature
  at great speeds. When the creature moves as quickly as it can, the action of the
  legs resembles a horse galloping.  The trunk extends into a thick, neck-like growth
  which the plant keeps elevated. At the end of the "neck" is a large assortment of
  leaves, roots and a clump of visual and olfactory organs. The leaves are used to
  gather sunlight, and the roots absorb liquids. The plant lowers its leaves and roots
  into pools of water when it drinks, an action that further resembles horse activity.  The
  pineto is much more cactus than horse. Every centimeter of its surface except for
  the leaves and roots is covered with long, sharp thorns. These thorns are usually
  5 centimeters or so in length Althcmgh sharp, they are somewhat flexible. These
  thorns give a pineto the appearance of having a hairy "coat" of thorns. The pinetos
  can be ridden, but a saddle of thick leather or other strong material is required.
combat: Opposite the neck growth is another growth that tapers to a relatively thin
  stalk that is covered in sharp spines that lay close to its body. This "tail" is
  flexible, and the plant can use it to attack.  It lashes out with its "tail" as
  a means of defense, but prefers to run away from attackers as quickly as possible.
society: Horse cacti are encountered in small groups of two or fuu1, u1 hrn.b of as
  much as 16. They reproduce by budding. Pinetos are extremely skittish and will bolt
  as soon as they perceive a threat. Only one of a pack has to become aware of the
  threat for everyone else to run.  Intelligent races, such as sleeths, have tamed
  pinetos and used them as beasts of burden and riding animals. In this respect, they
  have the same endurance and load-bearing qualities as a normal horse.
