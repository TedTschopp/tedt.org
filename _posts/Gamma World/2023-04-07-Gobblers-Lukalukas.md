description: These terrestrial birds are heavy and stupid, but fairly fast on their
  feet and able to fly clumsily for short distances. They have acute hearing and are
  only surprised on a 1. When encoun- tered by a known predator, they scatter, each
  leaving behind a cloud of opaque gas 9 m across which blind any character or creature
  that comes in contact with it. Each bird can do this only once every 4 hours, and
  it is indicative of their stupidity that they all release their gas at once whenever
  they are encountered.If a creature or character is not a known predator and approaches
  lukalukas in a peaceable, reassuring manner, roll a reac- tion check  they scatter
  on any result of 9 or less, and must check morale on any roll between 10 and 17.Once
  their gas is used, lukalukas are virtually defenseless when caught. How- ever, due
  to their habit of eating plants with bacterial symbiosis (which does not harm or
  leave any symptomatic marks on the bird), they should be thoroughly cooked before
  eating. If not, there is a 60% chance that any lukaluka is carrying a random plant-carried
  disease.
