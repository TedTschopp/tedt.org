New_Description: Carrins (also known as Dark Emperors) are 3 meter tall mutated vultures,
  weighing in at nearly 50 kilograms ( 110ibs). Taloned bird hands grow out of their
  wings along the front blade. They are usually dark coloured or black, and prefer
  to live in dimly lit locations. Most Carrins carry ceremonial spears with some sort
  of totem or mark attached near the top, like the skull of a dabber or the dried
  skin of a humanoid's face. They use these to help strike fear in their opponents,
  hoping to defeat them before combat even starts. These ceremonial spears are not
  used in combat, and the totems displayed on them may  be some sort of badge of rank
  or honour in Carrin society. A Carrin has 1d4 Blood Birds followers around at all
  times.
Combat: As a rule, Carrins avoid personal combat. They prefer to have their servants  or
  machines fight for them. Carrins are rarely without a plan or scheme. Whem all else
  fails, they try to use their telepathy to anticipate what their opponents are going
  to do. If forced into combat, they send their Blood Birds followers in first, while
  they flee to safety. Carrins frequently have powerful artifacts which they can use
  to defend themselves. If these strategies don't work, they make a strafing run,
  firing their poisoned quills (destructive, intensity 12) up to 5 meters at targets
  from beyond melee range.
Society: Carrins are known by many cultures as Dark Emperors. They gained this name
  because they rule large areas with an iron fist. A typical tactic of theirs is to
  control the flow of trade in their domain, carrying a high percentage off for their
  own consumption. Carrin society is a complicated structure where the wealthy make
  the rules and Machiavellian political intrigue is common. Currying favour and double-crossing
  is a way of life. Most Carrin schemes are elaborate, twisted plots.
