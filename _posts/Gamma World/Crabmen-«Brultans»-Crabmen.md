description: These large man-like crabs can be found in many regions of the ocean.
  They have a slightly tribal organization, but are rather nomadic, never staying
  in one area for too long. They are extremely tough fighters and are terrible to
  face in combat as they are hard to damage because of their mutations. They are able
  to manipulate many types of weapons, though they prefer pole arms the most. Even
  if they are unarmed their claws can still do considerable damage - or blast an opponent
  with bolts of radiation.
