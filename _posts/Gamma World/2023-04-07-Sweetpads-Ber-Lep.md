behavior: It can support the weight of a normal human, but pressure on the center
  of the pad causes it to snap shut around the trespasser.  It will dissolve its prey
  it will start doing 1d5 damage and increase the amount of damage each round the
  creature is still in the pad by 1 die until the creature is dead.

combat: The scent of ber lep serves to draw small animals and insects to them, which
  are killed by the plant's acidic secretions. The corrosive can cause some harm to
  larger creatures, but is usually too slow-acting to kill them (and the ber lep can't
  move or otherwise take offensive action). If the planet is injured, it reflexively
  teleports up to 25 meters away (leaving its attacker behind, and probably in the
  water).
society: Ber lep grow in areas of still water, like lakes or swamps. They feed on
  water minerals as well as small creatures they dissolve on their surfaces. They
  are unintelligent and incapable of movement.
