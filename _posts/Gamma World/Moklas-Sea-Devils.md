Description: During the twentieth century the world heard tales of a large creature
  living within the unexplored regions of the Congo The beast was said to be larger
  than an elephant with a long serpentine neck and small head The natives called the
  creature mokele  mbembe and scientists were able to film it in 1984 However the
  beast was not proven to exist until a live one was cap tured in 1989 These creatures
  were soon bred and cloned in captivity by the Ancients In time they were as common
  a sight at the zoo as were elephants them selvesAfter the Social Wars some of these
  creatures escaped from captivity to live in warm areas of the wilderness At present
  there are two species of this creature one which has been mutated by the war and
  one which has remained virtually unchanged over millennia The  Pure strain variety
  is described firstMokele  mbembe better known as the mokla or baby bront is a modernday
  descendant of the brontosaurus which was believed to have become extinct over 100
  million years ago The mokla weighs 915 tons and is a brownishgray in color Like
  many mutated reptiles and just as scientists had suspected of dinosaurs for many
  years moklas are warmblooded The mokla spends most of its time in the water only
  coming to shore in the early morning and late evening to feed on plant life there
  Otherwise it eats coarse lake vegetation of many sortsMoklas are very territorial
  and attack most creatures and boats which get too close to them Any creatures that
  are 3 m in height or less which are stepped on by a mokla must in addition to taking
  damage make a CN x 3 check or fall unconscious for 1d4 hours due to the beasts weight
  Creatures which come too near to a wading mokla may be knocked aside by the charging
  creature and probably nipped with its flat but painfully powerful teeth Moklas are
  not very brightThe mutated mokla has flippers in place of legs and it strongly resembles
  the prehistoric plesiosaur This flesheating creature feeds upon fish and small landdwelling
  animals  like humans humanoids and so forth The sea devil as it is known has been
  known to attack ships in order to devour the crew It fires electrical bolts from
  its back tentacles after arising from the water before a vessel attempting to sink
  the ship and gather up crewmen to eat The back tentacles are highly flexible and
  can squeeze prey 3 m or smaller doing 3d6 damage every Action Turn without requiring
  a roll to hit after the first successful hit The electrical hands of power mutation
  can be used up to 4 times per day Sea devils are completely immune to electrical
  effects If a sea devil fires its hands of power at the surface of the sea or underwater
  the damage done is reduced by half round fractions up but the electrical bolt is
  diffused over a spherical or hemispherical area with a radius of 3 mDuring the summer
  mating season both species of Moklas come ashore to lay their eggs in huge clutches
  which are covered over with sand and left alone The eggs hatch within a month and
  the young moklas then stay with the nearest local herd of their own species Moklas
  reach adulthood after a period of 1015 years and have a lifespan of over 500 years
