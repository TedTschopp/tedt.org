description: Katkins are similar in appearance to common house cats.  They are somewhat
  larger standing a meter tall while walking bipedally.  They have manipulative forepaws,
  allowing them to use weapons and tools, although they still possess sharp retractable
  claws capable of considerable harm.  Their fur can be either long or short with
  a range of coloration - White, Orange Striped, Calico, Black, Grey or Brown.  Katkins
  live in small family groups among the tree-tops.  The adults typically hunt as a
  team and kittens when old enough assist by driving the prey closer to the pair.  Katkins
  are reclusive and keep treetop summer homes, small camauflauged huts of branches
  and bark high in the threes.  In the winter they move to warmer quarters, usually
  a dwelling made from a hollowed out tree, although some have been known to build
  cabins.  contact with the outside world is normally limited to a select few trraders.  Katkins
  are the mortal foes of Squeekers.  They will attack these vermin whenever encountered,
  although not by foolhardy means.

behavior: Katkins typically rely on their own natural weapons and small Tech level
  2 ranged weapons such as darts, javelines, and msall bows and arrows.  If they possess
  usable artifact weapons as part of their treasure, they will use these as well.  However
  because of their small, light frames, katkins do not carry rifles or other large
  weapons when on the hunt.  Such gear is typically mounted for defense of the lair.  Their
  most common defense tactic is to use sound imitation to lure their prey away from
  the herd or nest and then attack from the trees.  By custom, they prefer to make
  skills with their own claws, often weakening a victim with missile weapons before
  closing in for melee.

new_description: Katkins are similar in appearance to common house cats, from which
  they sprang. They are somewhat larger, standing about a meter tall when walking
  bipedally. They have manipulative forepaws, allowing them to use weapons and tools,
  although they still possess sharp retractable claws capable of considerable harm.
  Their fur can be either long or short with a broad range of coloration-white, orange-striped,
  calico, black, grey, or brown.

  weapons-darts, javelins, and small bows and arrows. If they possess usable artifact
