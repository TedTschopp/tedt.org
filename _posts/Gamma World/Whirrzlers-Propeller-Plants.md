Mission: ''
Description: Whirrzlers are light metallic blue in color, so they are hardly visible
  at a distance. However, they never surprise creatures that can hear, because of
  the low whirring sound they make when they fly.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: Whirrzler leaves are as hard as iron and as sharp as swords; they attack
  by edging sideways into their opponents and slicing with several leaves at once.
  Whirrzlers attack creatures with AC 1 or 2 only once before flying away, since this
  hurts their leaves (doing l-4 hp damage to them).
Behavior: Whirrzlers are carnivorous desert plants that have developed a unique method
  of flight. They have no gas bags, instead rotating their flat rosettes of leaves
  so rapidly that they lift off like helicopters. They use this ability to settle
  their roots on carrion. Whirrzlers must feed fairly often; from time to time, they
  attack larger creatures wandering the desert.
