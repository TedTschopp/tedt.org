description: A rrerslith is a venomous snake with an unusal, gray skin which appears
  to be almost plastic to sight and touch.  Because of this, the unwary often mistake
  Rrerslith for heavy-duty computer or electrical cable.  A rrerslith can stay perfectly
  motionless, which makes it natural camouflage even more effective.  Rrerslith are
  constantly hungry and will attack whenever they have a chance.
equipment: Rrerslith love to collect shiny objects and there is usually a hidden treasure
  trove somewhere close to a Rrerslith nest (each nest is sually occupied by at least
  two rrerslith)
