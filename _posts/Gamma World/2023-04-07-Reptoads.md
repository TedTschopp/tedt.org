description: Reptoads appear to be nothing more than normal, olive-brown toads. They
  dig their lairs in sand, loose soil, or mud, leaving only their dark brown eyes
  showing. Unwary creatures have no chance of noticing these eyes. Creatures without
  heightened vision have only a 2% chance per action turn even if they are scanning
  the ground in search of a reptoad; creatures with heightened or otherwise highly
  superior vision have a 10% chance per action turn, and creatures with heightened
  or otherwise highly supe- rior smell have a 5% chance per action turn of locating
  a reptoad if they are actively trying.The mastery that reptoads have gained over
  force fields and repulsion fields is unparalleled in GAMMA WORLD game lands. Like
  standard repulsion fields, these fields last as long as the creature concen- trates
  on them. Reptoads can create an unlimited number each day. However, the reptoad
  has developed concentrative powers sufficient to maintain up to eight repulsion
  fields at the same time. The fields have a surface area of no more than 24 square
  meters, and must remain within 20 meters of the toad, but within those strictures,
  a reptoad can shape its repul- sion fields into any shape it wants  a 2-meter cube,
  a circular band to bind opponents together, a 2 x 8 x 8 meter cage (with repulsion
  field bars and gaps between), or a toad-shaped force field. (Reptoads keep any one
  of these fields around their bodies at all times.) When it wishes to eat, a reptoad
  simply puts up an outside repulsion field around itself and its prey, and only then
  takes down the inside one surrounding itself; thus, it is never vulnerable.All of
  a reptoads repulsion fields are proof against any normal physical attack; physical
  objects cannot pass through or damage the field. Also, laser, blaster, and energy-weapon
  attacks cannot pass through the field, but they can hit and automatically do normal
  damage to it. Each field has 50 hit points, but the reptoad can instantly renew
  any broken repulsion field if it is alive, conscious, and still within range. Radiation,
  heat, cold, gas, mental attacks and stun rays do not affect the repulsion field;
  these attacks pass through the field, although the first three attacks cannot harm
  a reptoad.Twice per day, a reptoad can also create a long-lasting repulsion field
  identical to the others in every way except that it does not require the toads continued
  concen- tration to keep it up. These shields stand for 50 + 1d100 days or until
  destroyed by energy attacks, even if the reptoad dies, is stunned, or goes away.
  The area around a reptoads lair is often cluttered with old, forgotten, invisible
  cages.Reptoads are vicious and cruel, hating all larger forms of terrestrial life.
  Their favor- ite pastime is to trap creatures in repul- sion fields and watch them
  slowly dehydrate or starve to death. Fortunately, reptoads have never been known
  to coop- erate with anyone  not even the Red Death. They care nothing for treasure
  or artifacts. The only creature feared by a reptoad is a sleeth, for a sleeth can
  dispel all of a reptoads repulsion fields just as if they were force fields.
