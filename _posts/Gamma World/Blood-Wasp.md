description: loodwasps are burrowing wasps about 10cm long. They exhibit some traits
  of both solitary and social insects; blood wasps live singly, in burrows, with 2d20+5
  burrows located in a region of 1 hectare. Their behaviour is controlled by pheromones.
  blood wasps wait in their burrows for prey.blood wasps sense their prey by smell
  within a range of 30m (plus or minus 10m for wind direction if any). They can also
  sense prey by feeling ground vibrations within a range of 5cm per kg of the prey.A
  Blood Wasp attacks with a dashing flight and a sting, delivering 1hp of damage and
  a paralyzing poison of intensity 14. The poison leaves its prey immobile, but conscious,
  while the Blood Wasp burrows one-half centimeter into its preys flesh and sucks
  3 ml of blood. This causes 1d4+1 more points of damage. When the first attacker
  is through feeding it will leave. Then, other blood wasps will approach and feed
  until the poison wears off or until all the wasps in range of the first attacker's
  Pheromone mutation have fed. Victims of blood wasps must pass an attribute check
  for MS each search turn, while the blood wasps' poison is in effect. If the victim
  fails an attribute check, he will suffer the irrational effects of the Insanity
  [D] mutation when the poison wears off. The victim does not have the insanity mutation
  permanently.blood wasps emit the patrolling pheromone when they are not feeding
  or fighting. blood wasps emit the warning pheromone when they are feeding, fighting,
  or attacking.
