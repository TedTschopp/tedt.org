Description: Originally this creature was a small potted houseplant which was left
  here by a frightened tourist during the evacuation of the starport. When the cloud
  of radioactive dust swept over the area, it caused the plant to mutate. Over the
  years the plant has kept the starport pest-free by devouring all intruders.

Behavior: When characters open the door to this room they will be attacked immediately
  by the monster's eight constricting vines. Each limb will take 10 points of damage
  before being severed. When four or more vines have been severed, the mutant plant
  will start flinging explosive seed pods at the party. Each pod may be thrown up
  to 20 meters, exploding on contact for 5d6 points of damage in a two-meter radius.
  The plant has only 10 pods.
