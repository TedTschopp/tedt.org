description: These huge winged creatures are the mutated descendents of the American
  Bald Eagle. The e'glee live on the craggy slopes of the highest mountains. Having
  a wing span close to 8 meters (Oversized Body Parts), leathery dark-brown wings
  and well- developed back and wing muscles, these mutants, when adult, are able to
  carry a single passenger when flying at normal speed. E'glee still bear the traditional
  mark of the bald eagle, white head feathers.E'glee are sometimes used as a steed
  by other mutants and humans but this is only in rare instances because the e'glee
  is very wary of other creatures. When meeting a creature that it does not trust,
  the e'glee first lets out a tremendous screech and uses its powers (Fear Generation)
  to ward of the unwanted visitor or enemy. With their giant taloned claws (6d8 damage)
  and curved beak (3d6 damage) these mutants are deadly hunters and killers. They
  have Heightened Vision ( large, bulging black eyes) allowing them to spot prey or
  enemies at great distances. Heightened Precision lets them do additional damage
  (2d6) to opponents in combat. Their usual targets for food are fish and small game,
  but in times of famine they have been known to hunt humanoids or PSH.The e'glee
  are intelligent, understanding Trade language, but they are unable to speak it themselves.
  The e'glee are deathly afraid of fire (Pyrophobia), smoke, and steam. Seeing or
  coming close to any fire larger than a bonfire sends them into an uncontrollable
  panic. E'glee heal damage by Regeneration.
