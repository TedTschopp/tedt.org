behavior: Juggernauts hunt by sight, using all 8 eyes. When prey is sighted, the juggernaut
  runs to the attack. It will retreat only when it fails morale or losses 3+ legs.They
  are a very important organism, as they keep mutant insect populations down, where
  they live. When intelligent beings see them, they tend to run away- which is good
  for both parties.
