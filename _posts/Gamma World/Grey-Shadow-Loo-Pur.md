description: Loo purs are cunning, carnivorous, mutant wolves that inhabit great portions
  of Northern Meriga. These six-legged (Multiple Body Parts) creatures are silvery
  grey in color and have glowing red eyes. A fierce predator made more deadly by its
  Chameleon Powers, loo purs travel in packs when hunting food in the forests and
  plains. When close to prey, these mutants let out a terrifying howl (Sonic Attack)
  and then strike with lightning speed. Individual mutant wolves within a pack will,
  on occasion, use their power of Temporal Fugue to make an entire pack of loo pur
  appear larger and more menacing to opponents. Lone loo purs often use this mutation
  to make prey believe there is more than one present.Standing 1 and a half meters
  tall at the shoulder, this mutant is able to carry a single rider of less than 50kg
  without any loss of speed. Obtaining a loo pur for a mount would require some form
  of mental force, as they are extremely intelligent, speak Trade language, and can
  even use some artifacts of the Ancients (limited by their physical constraints and
  their mutational defect  see below). All of these mutated wolves are afraid of electrical
  power, robots, etc. (Energy Sensitivity Defect) and will avoid such items at all
  cost.
