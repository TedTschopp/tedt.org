reactions: ''
behavior: They rarely attack PSH or other mutant animals on sight. They will attack
  a large party, but wait until it has been softened first. Their preferred methods
  are ambushes, or luring the unwary into snares, pits, and deadfalls. They achieve
  a high degree of success by using their chameleon powers to hide out in the open
  while using their mental blast mutantation. Their mental blast mutation is a variant
  that renders the opponent confused and bewildered for 1d4+ MS rounds. At this time
  they will attempt to lure their prey into a trap and finish him off. They are not
  cowards so they check for morale once very two turns. Battle is glorious but only
  if they have the advantage. They enjoy hand-to-hand combat, but are capable and
  usually possess Tech Level II, III, and IV items, but very rare for the latter.
  As well as their pack association, their ranks can be found it the Iron Society
  and Zoopremists, but only as guerilla warriors or terrorists. They are openly hostile
  to the Peace Brigade (Racketeers with no sense of Morality or Honor) and Ranks of
  the Fit (whom they consider stupid zealots).
