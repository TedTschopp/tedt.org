description: The cren tosh (or "lizard fish" as it is sometimes known) is a 2 meter
  long fish with silvery-green scales and a relatively flat body. With its mutant
  shapechanging ability, it can appear as various other creatures and even operate
  on land for up to 24 hours at a time.

behavior: The transformation power can only be used once every 24 hours.  In the water
  the fish lives under the overhanging banks where it makes its nest which it lines
  with shiny objects.  It is a vegetarian.

combat: Cren tosh are only marginally intelligent, and generally harmless toward other
  creatures (they are placid plant-eaters), but they are drawn to small, shiny objects
  which they use to decorate their lairs. A cren tosh is likely to try and steal such
  objects and escape with them, including metal coins, jewelry, and some Ancient items.
  They fight only when cornered, otherwise using all their abilities to escape. Cren
  tosh can use their Metamorphosis mutation to assume the form of any reptile of approximately
  their mass, gaining all of that creatures abilities (including physical ability
  scores and mutations, but not mental ability scores or mutations).
society: Cren tosh live in lakes, rivers, or steams, burrowing long tunnels into the
  muddy banks to use as a nest. They line their nests with shiny pebbles and objects
  they have collected, and lay their eggs there. They defend the nest fiercely until
  the eggs hatch, then the young cren tosh are left on their own.
