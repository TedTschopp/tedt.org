description: Based appear as gray, hunched-over bipedal humanoids with long, apeish
  arms ending in large claws.  If they stand still they can pass for rocks using the
  same rules Plantients can to hide.  They have a goat-shaped head with two wide set
  eyes.  They are extremely belligerent towards intelligent life forms.

behavior: The Ba'sled is extremely belligerent towards intelligent life forms.  They
  can seldom be bargained with with or telepathically communicated with because of
  their attitude.  They can dig through anything but metal at their normal movement
  rate, clawing right through stone walls as if they were so much clay.  They often
  make traps by digging underground tunnel mazes, then making pits from the tunnel
  up to just below ground level.  These pits will not support the full weight of more
  than one human-sized creature and can drop members of a party of adventurers into
  the waiting claws of the Ba'sleds.  In addition to their murderous claws they also
  have a sonic roar that can only be used once a day.  This attack does 1d5 damage
  to everything 15 feet in front of the roaring Based.  They are immune to their own
  sonic roars.
