description: He slouches to 1.5 meters tall.  His large ears stick out from a bald
  head.  The deformity of his arms and legs would earn him a spot on any beggers'
  steet.  His nose is completly sealed over, eliminating any sense of smell.  Waja
  usually reeks of garbage and rot.  His entire body is covered with small suction
  cups, even his head and face.
equipment: Rags, dagger, Walking Staff, assorted Junk

behavior: Waja was once a Radioactivist.  Mebers of that cyrptic alliance worship
  the glory and power of the atom, and regularly subject themselves to radiation in
  order to gain more mutations.  Waja was exiled from their ranks for his preponderance
  of defects, which were taken as a sign of his weak faith.  Waja has surived by always
  pretending to be dumber then he really is, and by staying out of trouble.  His intution
  has helped tremendouly.  As the Game Master, when role-playing Waja, don't breathe
  through your nose while speaking.  This simulates his nasal delivery.  Be advized
  that Waja only uses his mutations in times of dire need.  He has survived in the
  wilderness by playing the harmless mutant

combat: In combat, Waja turns on his force field, and keeps up a dialogue on the current
  condition of his fear while racing about aimlesly.  In a heated battle, he uses
  his mental blast.  IF his life is directly threatened, he might use a molecular
  disruption.  AFterwards he always denies any accusations, for good or bad, regarding
  his role in battle.
