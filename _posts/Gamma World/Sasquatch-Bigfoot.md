Description: Once docile and secretive inhabitants of woodlands and mountains worldwide,
  these beings have mutated into fearsome (yet philosophical) killing machines.  Standing
  2.2 meters tall and weighing 180 kilograms, the sasquatch is an imposing figure.
  Their fur and long manes range from blacks and browns through shades of gray. Their
  fingers are tipped with deadly claws.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Though sasquatch prefer to keep to themselves, they are occasionally encountered
  when tracking prey. Such hunting parties carry crossbows and won't hesitate to defend
  themselves with deadly force. Still, the sasquatch code of honor prevents them from
  attacking creatures smaller than themselves without good reason. In addition, they
  freely accept opponents' offers of surrender, seeing no glory in defeating an opponent
  who is already beaten.
Society: Sasquatch view the world as something to be protected and valued for itself,
  rather than being changed to fit the needs of the locals. They are loyal to a fault,
  passionate for both war and debate, and suspicious of Ancient or Shadow Age technology.
  In fact, they suffer a +2 penalty when using anything other than Gamma Age technology.
  Sasquatch villages tend to be located in secluded vales, hidden clearings, and lofty
  mountain ranges. They respect humans and most other sentient racesas long as those
  species don't cross the sasquatchbut don't trust the technologically altered androids.
