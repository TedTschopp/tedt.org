behavior: A 'worm is aggressive and will attack any living thing it detects. If the
  prey is distant, the hellworm will use pyrokinesis. If the prey is up to 10 meters
  away, the 'worm will rear up and spit fire upon it. If the flames do not kill the
  prey, the hellworm will attack with its horns and bite until the prey is dead or
  it can spit again.They have no real society, they just congregate. They feed on
  heat resistant lichens and fungus, some minerals, other heat loving animals (e.g.
  relanops), and adventurers.  Hell Worms are found in volcanos, mostly in and around
  the natural cavern systems found deep inside and feed on blights, yexils, yfiefs,
  parns, and mantas. They ignore and are ignored by obbs; they are preyed upon by
  the Kraak (see Overlord of Bonparr).
