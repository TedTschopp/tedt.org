description: Maroon Birds, 16cm in length, covered in black spikes.  They make strange,
  almost electronic sounds.  They live in holes in the round or in among rocks and
  cliffs. They always travel in flocks and act as a single unit
equipment: ''
reactions: ''
behavior: The Shez'ur Attack together.  When attacking the birds everyone suffers
  a -2d to hit due to their size.   The birds themselves will attack one target at
  a time.  They will cause 1d10 for every 10 birds in the flock.  Their spikes effectively
  reduce all AC by 3.  An attacked character can not see through the swarm.  Movement
  is reduced to one quarter if more than 30 birds attack.  They are generally peaceful,
  unless their nests are threatened or loud noises frighten them.
