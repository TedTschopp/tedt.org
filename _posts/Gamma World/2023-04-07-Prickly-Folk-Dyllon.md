description: Dyllon are a race of insular mutant porcupine. They never grow much taller
  than a ten year old, and are covered in a mass of long, sharp brown quills. They
  also have an organ on their rear that can produce either light or musk, depending
  on them. Occasionally (10%) one is born that is much bigger than the others, and
  these are always tribal leaders, known as the Bobs. Strangely, the Bobs do not share
  the quills of their smaller relatives, and instead are a frail, naked pink, and
  usually seen wearing heavy robes as protection.  Dyllon live in small tribes of
  up to 30 members. They construct plastered, squat adobe houses for shelter, but
  for the most part spend their time hunting or farming the grasslands. They are also
  extremely adept scavengers.

behavior: Dyllon also have the Pyrokinesis mutation which they use in mutual defense.
  Any predators approaching a Dillon village will have to deal with a lot of brush
  fires Occasionally (10%) one is born that is much bigger than the others, and these
  are always tribal leaders, known as the Bobs. The Bobs possess the Death Field Generation
  mutation, which they use to kill intruders approaching the village, as well as Force
  Field Generation which will provide 10Hp for every Dyllon within 100m of the Bob,
  again as protection for the village. All Dyllon are immune to the effects of the
  Bobs mutations. Any Bob has a 40% chance of possessing a weapon of TL IV or higher.
  Other dyllon may also have artifacts (15%)
