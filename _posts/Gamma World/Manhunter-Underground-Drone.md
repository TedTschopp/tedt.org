Description: This cyber is also cov- ered in plastic armor, but has tracked rollers
  that can be lowered for ground movement. It is equipped with radar capa- bilities
  (up to 200 meters) and armed with two Mark V pistols as well as two stun rifles
  on a top mount. A flamegun that has four charges and does 8d10 damage out to 10
  meters (weapon class 16) is attached to one end of the robot. The cyber is also
  capable of spraying a kinetic nullifier fluid (effects are detailed in the GAMMA
  WORLD game rules) over a 10-meter- square area (six uses possible).Like the underwater
  model, this under- ground model is equipped with a tractor/ pressor beam capable
  of lifting up to 200 kilograms for the purpose of transporting the character or
  object it was assigned to ind back to the Manhunter.The cyber units are used for
  retrievingor killing characters that flee into areas the Manhunter is not suited
  for traversing. Once a character is caught by a cyber tracker, he brought back and
  captured by the Manhunters own tractor/pressor beam (which can lift 500 kilograms).
  Once in this field, the individual is taken up into the unit and stored in a very
  special facil- ity on its underside.The Manhunter contains one entire stasis chamber
  that works as the one described in the GAMMA WORLD game. The character is kept in
  the state of slee- plike suspended animation until brought back to the commanding
  Cybernetic Instal- lation for whatever purpose the CI has in mind. Individuals in
  this chamber can be healed by a robotic medi-kit if necessary, but the stasis chamber
  can also work as a rejuv chamber for characters who are nearly dead. Up to four
  man-sized beings (500 kilograms) may be kept in the chamber.The upper surface of
  the Manhunter also carries a number of special probes, described below.
