description: Mught are gaseous creatures that live on stored energy, such as batteries,
  energy cells, and the like.  they can detect stored energy at a range of 130 meters.  They
  are constantly on the move and can control the direction of their bodies under normal
  inside air currents.  Because of this they will never go outside, but rather travel
  long distances through fissures in the earth, old undergound pipes or cables, and
  so forth.  They can easily travel wihtin a building through air ducts, under doors,
  etc.  They are easy to spot in dim light and look like miniature rolling clouds
equipment: Mught are often found around charged energy cells, electrocal generating
  equiptment, or operational machines.  While Mught do not have any treasure of their
  own, they are often an indicator of operational look admist junk.

combat: A Mught can emit an electrical charge on contact with a creature (I16) but
  it prefers not to use a stored charge / food in that manner.  Nothing cna hurt a
  mught except sonics; strong wind, or rain can drive a Mught away, but not destroy
  it.n  A Mught will "attack" a party of characters to get at any energy cells they
  have.  A Mught can drain a full energy cell (any type) merely by wrapping around
  it for a full action.  It will be full after draining four cells in this way and
  drify off leaving the party alone.  This meal will last it for 48 hours.
