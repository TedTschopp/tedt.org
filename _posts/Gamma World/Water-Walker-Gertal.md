  the ability to "walk" on water. This is accomplished by large water resistant hairs
  on each foot. To move It extends one claw into the water (otherwise it would just

  the prey is live, the ger'tal moves within range of its stunning force and uses
  it. Anyone not stunned is bitten or irradiated to death.Ger'tal are found in clumps-
  that is in groups that have no interaction between members. They feed on anything
  living or dead on or near the water.
