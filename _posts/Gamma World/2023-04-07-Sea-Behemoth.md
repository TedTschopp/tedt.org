description: Sea Behemoths are little more than gigantic mutant versions of ordinary
  sea creatures. Their large size (usually around 100 meters or so) makes them extremely
  dangerous. They can be encountered in any region of the ocean and sometimes will
  come ashore looking for food when it becomes scarce in their area. In most cases
  they will have no additional mutations (other than their monstrous size), but some
  may have numerous mutations which they will use to full effect.
