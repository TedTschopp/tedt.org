description: An obb or "flying eye," looks vaguely like a bat-winged creature about
  a meter long, with a large, central eye between its "shoulders" and a pair of clawed
  limbs. Its surface is dead black and covered in short, soft fuzz. Although it's
  mobile and resembles an animal, the obb is actually a mutant form of fungus.

behavior: Obbs are carnivores, but eat only half of their victims. They leave spores
  in the uneaten portion which grow into 1d6 young Obbs (minimum characteristics)
  within 24 hours. Obbs are completely resistant to radiation, heat, light and lasers.
  They may (rarely) be recruited (but never hired.)

new_description: ''
combat: Clumsy, almost immobile, on the ground, obbs are graceful aerial hunters.
  They swoop down and attack with a blast of radiation from their eye. Then they stalk
  their prey until they show signs of weakness, attacking again with their claws.
  They consume half of the fallen prey, then spread spores over the rest that consume
  the carcass and sprout into young obbs that detach and fly away a few days later.
society: Obbs display a kind of intelligence and cunning, but it's unclear just how
  intelligent they are. Their minds are entirely alien and they don't seem to follow
  what most creatures would consider logic or reason. They're solitary creatures,
  having no need for social structures of any kind.
