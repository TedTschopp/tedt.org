description: Seps are mutated sharks that have fully adapted to life on land and are
  no longer suited for living in the water. The Sand Seps are adapted to living in
  the sand and are only found in deserts.  The Sep has an organ in their brains that
  pushes and packs earth out of its way allowing it to swim forward below the surface
  of the earth.

behavior: Once a Sep has swum under its prey it will leap into the air snapping their
  victim in their jaws and pulling them underground.  A Sep will tend to strafe a
  their prey until they have either killed and pulled the group under or they have
  killed all their prey.  Seps can sense motion and sound up to 60 meters away.

combat: Seps can sense vibrations on the surface up to 50 meters way and usually spring
  suddenly from the ground to bite prey their their powerful jaws. They can just as
  quickly dive back below the surface, circling around for another attack from a different
  direction. Once killed, the prey is dragged below-ground and eaten.
society: Seps tend to hunt singly, although they're sometimes encountered in small
  "schools" of up to six. They inhabit deserts and other sandy regions.
