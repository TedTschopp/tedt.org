description: These bipedal, human- oid wolves are one of the more deadly species on
  the Gamma World. Luckily, they arent encountered often, for these clever and malicious
  creatures enjoy tricking parties of adventurers. They will meet adventurers in their
  Pure Strain Human form and try to join the adventurers. If they gain the partys
  trust, they will carefully work their way into positions in which they can success-
  fully slay as many Pure Strain Humans as possible, as they consider the meat a delicacy.For
  some unknown reason, howlers are highly allergic to silver metal. If they are merely
  touched by silver, it will cause 1 point of damage per action turn to them. A weapon
  made of silver will do double normal damage if it hits a howler. Any damage caused
  by silver or silver weapons cannot be regenerated or healed by these creatures.
  Howlers are actually able to smell silver.Both howlers and dracs (q.v.) are believed
  to have been purposefully bred by unknown agencies or beings for unknown reasons.
  Howlers resemble the Ancients concept of werewolves in many ways.Howlers will usually
  possess several items of Tech Level II. They will only associate with other mutant
  animals, and are quite rare at present.
