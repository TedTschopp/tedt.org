mission: Varies from model to model, but always involves the production, assembly,
  or testing of whatever the company makes. These robots have a strong sense of property
  value.
description: There are two 6-meter-long tentacles on the front and a single smaller
  claw on a 2-meter-long arm just below them. The body is a large block, with a cargo
  bay area loaded from the top. Large tracks line either side, each 2 meters tall.
  Usually these behemoths are tracked robots (as is this model), but occasionally,
  they will have wheels or legs, or, rarely, anti-gray pods. These robots have a flat,
  emotionless, stereotypical computer voices.
equipment: This industrial robot has a radio, fire extinguish-er, headlights, warning
  tones (for backing up and turning corners) and an external thermometer. Different
  models may include specialty tools for the particular tasks they were de-signed
  for. This particular model has none. Options include lasers (for drilling), rotating
  blades, electrical probes, arc welders, etc. Most of the tasks performed by the
  robot are done with its tentacles. The claw is used for the few tasks that require
  fine manipulations. The tentacles have a DX of 10 and a PS of 30, while the claw
  has a DX of 15 and a PS of 10.
reactions: The common 1.D. card and the supervisor's I.D. card function normally,
  as do the maintenance cards. None of these cards can be used to get the robot to
  leave the grounds of the industrial complex. Programmer's cards are rare for this
  type of robot. All industrial robots respond to civil authority cards, such as those
  carried by the police, firefighters, ambulance crews, etc. The robot will obey any
  order given by a civil author-ity card bearer that does not obviously harm a person,
  including orders not allowed by the supervisory cards. Industrial robots will go
  out of its way to prevent or avoid harm to corporate property. They are programmed
  with lists of what is to be safeguarded (machinery, tools, etc.) and what it is
  okay to damage (scraps, raw materials for processing, etc.). They will move to prevent
  a person from damaging property, but will not go so far as to harm a person.
