description: Vilchneks are predatory spiders that use their chameleon powers to lie
  in wait undetected until prey hap- pens by. Parties are surprised by a vilch- nek
  encounter unless they succeed on a surprise roll and the character with the highest
  IN in the party makes a successful check vs. IN x 1, or unless someone in the party
  has a mutation that negates surprise, such as intuition. Vilchneks have eyes all
  around their heads, so they cannot be surprised by anything visible. They are surprised
  by invisible creatures on foot only on a 5 or 6, because they are very sensitive
  to ground vibrations. Vilchneks tend to lurk in trees or among shrubs on the ground,
  and hunt by day or by night. They can cover up to 12 m in a single leap. Their fear
  impulse is set off only by birds and other winged creatures at least as large as
  themselves, and they may not notice furled wings.
