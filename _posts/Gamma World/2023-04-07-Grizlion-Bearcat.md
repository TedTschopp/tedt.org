description: Also called the grizlion, this fearsome predator is actually neither
  bear nor cat, but rather a giant mutation of the wolverine.  If anything its ferocity
  has increased with size.  The griozlion is fully 3 meters from nose to tail and
  over 1.5 meters tall at the shouldder.  Its fur is black and dark brown, often with
  dark yellowish coloration around the face or haunches.  It has vicious claws, and
  its mouth of razor-sharp teeth is usually twisted in a snarling grimace.

combat: The bearcat is most often encountered hunting for food. Though it prefers
  meat, bearcats consume almost anything when hungrysome have been cut open to reveal
  cloth, wood, or even metal within. When it attacks, it attempts to lock its jaws
  onto its prey and then disembowel with its great claws. A hit with the bite attack
  grants two claw attacks, with a 1, 2, or 3 bonus based on the success of the bite.
  Despite the bearcat's bloodthirsty nature, it is remarkably clever (for an animal)
  and often stalks prey for some time before striking.  It often preys on large animals
  slowed by illness, injury, or age. It never shies away from a fight, however, no
  matter how large its opponent.
society: Thankfully, bearcats live in forested hills and mountains, usually far from
  civilization. During particularly harsh winters, however, bearcats have been known
  to come down to lower altitudes and find food in or near settled areas.
