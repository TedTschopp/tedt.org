description: Skwil are dog-sized mutant squirrels that inhabit most of Gamma Meriga's
  wilderness. This shy creature is easily recognized by it's curly light brown, gray,
  and black spotted fur, and it's large zebra striped prehensile tail. These mutated
  squirrels are so shy that they use their Empathy powers to detect the approach of
  other beings and can only be surprised on a roll of 1. If they feel sufficiently
  threatened by the approaching creature, they will use any number of protective mutations
  (Beguiling, Physical Reflection, Stunning Force, Teleport Objects, or Weather Manipulation)
  to ward off the intruder. These mutants are quite acrobatic (Heightened Balance)
  and live most of their lives in the branches of trees.Skwil are mildly intelligent
  and can speak in short simple phrases when using Trade language. They love collecting
  shiny items and stealing things from other creatures (Teleport Objects). These mutated
  squirrels are able to use small weapons and items of the Ancients with their front
  paws. Their main source of food are berries, nuts, and fruit found in the fertile
  wilderness. Skwil often, because of immediate dangers or because of incredible laziness,
  teleport food from neighboring trees or bushes into their paws. Although these mutants
  are very sensitive to pain (Doubled Pain [D]) they overcome this debilitating defect
  by employing their powerful mutation, Total Healing.
