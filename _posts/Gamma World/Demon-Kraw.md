behavior: Kraw are extremely evil creatures that seem to enjoy harming others.  It
  has been suggested that they do not orignate on this planet, but that theory has
  never been proven.  Kraw have an unreasoning fear of androids and will run at the
  very sight of them.  When they desire, Kraw can teleport to any distance, within
  line-of-sight (max 1km).  Kraw will not usually perform this action, as teleportation
  is their sole action.  Otherwise they have two actions.

  all opponents in a 10 meter radius (1d7).  Kraw can use this power only twice a
