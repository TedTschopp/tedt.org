description: Truly neither fish nor fowl, the terl is a 2 to 3 meter long mutant baracuda
  that is covered in bright parrot like feathers rather than scales, and capable of
  breathing air. They are capable of "swimming" through the air via telekinesis. They
  live in trees like birds as well.  The Trel returns to the water to spawn in the
  spring and it is fully capable of breathing both water and air.

behavior: The Trell is a dangerous carnivore that prefers to use its mental powers
  to kill its prey, resorting to its bite only as a last resort.  If both bite and
  mental powers fail, it will retreat to find easier game.  The feathers protect it
  against all heat, laser, and light attacks.  The feathers will glow in the presence
  of radiation, providing the Trel a warning.  Trel feathers, if properly harvested
  and Prepared will still retain this ability.  Sleeths and other back to nature species
  will make cloaks out of Trel feathers that provide the wearer immunities.

combat: Terl are predators, using their mutations and their vicious bite to bring
  down their prey. They generally nest in trees, swooping down to attack their prey.
society: Terl are sometimes found in small schools, but usually appear singly. Females
  lay their eggs in shallow water, where they hatch into immature terl that immediately
  fly away and never return to the watery environment.
