description: This massive mutated buffalo weighs well over a ton and is justifiably
  feared by most reatures living in the region. The Bulo is a creature that predators
  generally tend to avoid unless extremely hungry. Bulos look amazingly like their
  ancestors, except for the peculiar purple matted fur that covers their arge-framed
  bodies.Being plant eaters,Bulos do not hunt for food although they are very protective
  of their grazing lands.

behavior: The Bulo is extremely protective of its current field it grazes in and will
  kill or frighten off intruders.  Combining the great charging speed of an animal
  this size along with a very evil temper, hrough the years Bulos have developed a
  thick skull which has aided them in perfecting their primary mode of attack...the
  charge. When angered, a Bulo will charge its target, butt the creature with its
  head and knock it down, and then attempt to trample the prone victim. Anytime a
  Bulo successfully butts its target,that creature is considered knocked down to the
  ground and must fight with a -2 penalty "to hit"during its next combat round.A Bulo
  will attempt to trample any victim it knocks down (roll again "to hit" with the
  trample attack).Any target trampled can not be bitten that round by the Bulo.If
  a person is trampled by a Bulo,there is also a chance that any items being carried
  by that person will be damaged or destroyed (GM's decision depending on items and
  circumstances). The ability to absorb a certain amount of damage from physical blows
  each round (see KineticAbsorption mutation) makes the Bulo one of the toughest opponents
  around. Finally,the power to shape- change allows the Bulo to change form into any
  one of the following three flying insect-like creatures; a Blaash, a Blight, or
  a Cal Then.
