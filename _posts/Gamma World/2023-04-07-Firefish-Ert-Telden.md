  like a catfish.

behavior: This fish can secrete an oil which makes it burst into flame and burn anything
  within 10 meters.  If the fish is removed from the water and exposed to air, it
  will explode in 1d3 rounds.  It will cause its damage to everything within 30 meters.  Some
  intelligent species raise these fish and use catapults to deliver them in battle.
  a standard catapult will carry 12 fish ever 3 turns and has a range of 300 meters.

combat: Ert telden have an unusual defense mechanism and are often called "fire fish"
  because of it. When panicked or killed, ert telden screte an oil that causes their
  flesh to burn fiercely on contact with air. When removed from the water, an ert
  telden becomes extremely hot, the following round, it explodes, doing damage like
  an incendiary grenade.
society: Ert telden are found in still water like marshes and swamps, where they bottom-feed
  on water plants and other organic matter. Some villages and tribes in Gamma Terra
  understake the dangerous task of capturing or raising ert telden, keeping them in
  shallow pools and flinging them over walls by hand or by catapult as weapons.
