description: 'At first glance, a kai lin looks like an odd sort of reptile: a 3-meter
  long, sinuous body with a single pair of short, claws limbs that allow it to move,
  dragging its long tail behind it, a blunt, triangular head like a snake and rough,
  green scales. But in fact the kai lin is not an animal, but a mutant breed of plant.
  Its "scales" are rough bark and its "claws" a thorny pads and its "tail" is a trailing
  root cluster.'

behavior: This creatures bark gives complete protection from radiation.  Its roots
  look much like a tail when in motion, when it finds carrion, it intertwines these
  roots in the victim and absorbs sustenance.  Although it will only eat dead creatures,
  it is more than capable of killing prey when in need.

combat: A Mught can emit an electrical charge on contact with a creature (I16) but
  it prefers not to use a stored charge / food in that manner.  Nothing cna hurt a
  mught except sonics; strong wind, or rain can drive a Mught away, but not destroy
  it.n  A Mught will 'attack' a party of characters to get at any energy cells they
  have.  A Mught can drain a full energy cell (any type) merely by wrapping around
  it for a full action.  It will be full after draining four cells in this way and
  drify off leaving the party alone.  This meal will last it for 48 hours.
society: Kai lin aren't intelligent and have a pack-structure, cooperating for mutual
  survival. They reproduce by producing shoots that root into the ground and mature
  over the course of 6-8 weeks before uprooting and becoming adult kai lin.
