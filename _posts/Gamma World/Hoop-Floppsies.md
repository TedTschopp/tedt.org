Description: Mutated Rabbitoid creatures averaging 2.6 meters in height who walk erect.

Behavior: They can leap twice their movement distance.  They can turn any metal item,
  at will, into rubber with an affected radius of 1 meter.  Hoops love artifacts and
  there is a 30% chance that any hoop encountered has 1d4 artifacts on in their possession.  There
  is a 20% chance that they known how to use each artifact they possess.

New_Description: These mutated rabbits average 2.5 meters in height (not counting
  their long ears, which add as much as another meter). They stand erect, though they
  often crouch, ready to use their powerful legs to jump at a moment's notice. Most
  hoops have white fur, though some have brown or yellow markings. Hoops do not look
  cute or cuddly in the slightest, at least not while they are awake.  They usually
  bear cruel expressions, and their malicious grins show their sharp teeth. Hoops
  wear armor and carry Tech Level I and II melee weapons in addition to their artifacts.
  They favor swords, axes, and short bows.
Combat: Hoops patrol their home area in military units. When they spot an intruder,
  they attack first with ranged weapons, then leap to attack in an organized manner.
  Hoops are able to leap as far as 10 meters. Once hoops have moved into melee, they
  will first attempt to touch any metal items carried by their opponents. If they
  are successful in this attack, the molecular bonding of the metal item is altered,
  and it becomes like rubber-soft, stretchy, etc. Softened weapons and armor are all
  but useless; armor protection is negated and weapons do minimum damage.  Artifacts
  affected by this power no longer work.  Once the hoops' opponents are weakened in
  this manner, the hoops will proceed to enter melee. After 1d4 hours the softened
  metal returns to normal, and the item resumes its normal shape. Artifacts will function
  normally once again. During a combat, hoops use their mutations to stay in contact
  with and help one another.
Society: Hoops Society is based on a military structure, and a community's leader
  is always called "general." Hoops try to gather as many artifacts as they can to
  "maintain combat superiority." They consider "floppsies" a derogatory term.
