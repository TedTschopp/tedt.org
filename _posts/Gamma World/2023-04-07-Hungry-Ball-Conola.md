description: Conola are large, living spheres covered with matted hair.  They travel
  by rolling forward, like a tumbleweed, aparently under their own muscle-power.  They
  are relitevely unitntelligent scavengers.  Ususally found in installations and other
  types of ruins.  conola roll endlessly through the hallways consuming dirt, debris,
  carcasses, dropped items.  Conola are completly silent.

behavior: If the concola encounters living creatures, such as a party, it will sually
  just brush past them and continue on its way.  It is only concerned with the inanimate.  Any
  character who is brushed by a conola should have any loose items on his person checked
  by the GM to make sure they have not accidently been swept away DX12 to avoid having
  it lifted.  ST11 to avoid having the item pulled into its body.  If the party leaves
  anything in a corridor or room that is open to a passageway for more than 6 hours,
  there is a 20% chance for a conola will come by and sweep up the area, taking the
  item or creature with it and digesting it. Slaying a conola causes its internal
  acidic juices to spray over an area that includes its body + a 3 meter radius.  Anything
  and anyone niside recieves damage from the acid (I12)

combat: Conola are completly silent and always gain surpirse.  When a conola brushes
  against something, its hars whisk it inside the covering, where it si broken down
  by strong acids and is consumed within 10 turns.  If the area is inhabited by a
  concola is large, such as a natural cavern system, the cleaning is not always apparent
  because places like that cannot be thorougly cleaned.  Only with a conola comes
  across something more than half its diameter in sie will it slow down to digest
  it a section at a time.
