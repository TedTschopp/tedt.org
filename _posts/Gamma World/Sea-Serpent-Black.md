Description: Black sea serpents are mutated snakes that have adopted the anaconda's
  lifestyle. They are between 3 and 12 meters long, jet black with green stripes,
  have thick scales, and sonar to detect prey. Black sea serpents capture a prey animal
  by biting it and coiling around it. It does not crush the prey (like the myths state),
  but instead, keep the animal from breathing by compressing its lungs (use suffocation
  rules). They then swallow the prey whole, having no way of chewing. If found on
  land, a serpent is just as dangerous as if it was in the water. They can be driven
  off by fire and extreme cold.Black sea serpents are only found in freshwater lakes
  and ponds. They like to hide among the weeds that float near the surface and catch
  the birds and fish that visit the weed mats. Occasionally, one out hunting will
  fall prey to sea lilies or the giant sea serpents, but otherwise they tend to die
  of old age. They hibernate during the winter on land in deep mud. The snakes are
  considered a major threat to the fishermen of both bodies of water. They do not
  congregate, except during mating, when up to 10 males try to mate with a single
  female.
