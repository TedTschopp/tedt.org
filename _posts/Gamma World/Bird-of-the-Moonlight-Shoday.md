description: (Pet) Sho'day are nocturnal birds that avoid confrontation and are extremely
  curious.   They will circle low over encampments and sometime "buzz" them to get
  a better look at those sitting around the campground.  They love hot food of any
  kind.  If the campground has any, and the campers are friendly, they will attempt
  to land.  The Sho'day nest in trees and tall rocks and soar to incredible heights
  when hunting, they usually hunt small mammals or fish.  They have incredible sight,
  are completely black, and have a wingspan of over 6 feet.

behavior: The Sho'day are treated extremely well and they are certain of this through
  the use of their empathy and telepath mutations that no harm is intended to them,
  they will trade hot food for the use of their Total Healing Others Mutation.  This
  mutation can only be used on other organisms and only 4 times a week.  Sho'day can
  be trained by a character if they have the talent of training animals, the bird
  has been exposed to the trainer since being a chick, and suitable time and experience
  is dedicated to the task  (up to the Judge)
