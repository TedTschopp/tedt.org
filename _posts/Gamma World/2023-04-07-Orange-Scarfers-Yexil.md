behavior: Yexils are slow witted, but friendly.  Their size and ability to loose a
  laser blast from their eyes (per laser rifle) discourages predators.  Yexils are
  immune to cold attacks.  They eat manufactured clothing of all types and find synthetics
  especially tasty.  In fact, the snappier the outfit, the better yexils like the
  taste.  They will often trade "useless" artifacts for "food" of this type.
