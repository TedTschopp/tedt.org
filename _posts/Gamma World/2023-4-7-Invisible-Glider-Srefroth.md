description: Sre'froth are lifeofrms that resemble two to three meter transparent
  gelatinous planes. Their origins are unknown, but they are thought to be amphibians
  who learned how to glide. They are definitely not flyers. Sre'froth can blend in
  anywhere, crawl up any surface, and attach themselves on anything, even ceilings,
  by secreting a warm, sticky fluid as they move.
equipment: ''
reactions: ''
behavior: Thousands of transparent cilia on their bodies can feel" body heat within
  a 50 foot radius, high heat can be felt at even greater distances. Sre'froth feed
  on animals they detect and come into contact with by wrapping around them, somewhat
  like plastic food wrap, and secreting strong acid around the prey. This usually
  dissolves their victims in a very short time and the ooze that is left over is absorbed
  into the sre'froth as straight protein. Their damage is considered to be Intensity
  2d6+4 poison/ corrosive. Damage from this special type of attack is per turn of
  envelopment. The outer protein (clothing, hide, armor, etc.) must be eaten away
  before the character takes damage, unless a large portion of their body is exposed.
  Use the following chart to determine the time required by the see'froth to consume
  different types of materials. Remember, any equipment the sre'froth comes into contact
  with will also be affected.  Cloth, Vegetation, Wood, Common Plastics, and Most
  synthetics survive for 1 turn.  Light metals and Heavy Plastics survive for two
  turns.  Heavy Metals and Plastic / metal alloys will survive for three turns.  Ceramics,
  Glass, Curalloy and certain other materials are not affected.  Sre'froth can only
  be hurt by poison, sonics, super-strong acids (Intensity 17+), fire, or drowning.
  Once they have climbed to a height of at least 10 feet they can launch themselves
  into a silent glide. The distance of the glide cannot exceed the height of their
  climb.   On the ground sre'froth are 95% undetectable by sight, when gliding this
  drops to 75%. They cannot sense body heat through ba'mutan hides and those characters
  protected by such can pass by sre'froth undetected. Ruins, caves, deep woods, buildings,
  and canyons are their favorite environs but they can be found anywhere.
