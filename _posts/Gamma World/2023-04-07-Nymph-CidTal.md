behavior: When a cid'tal sees prey, it flies to the attack. It uses it beak to punch
  a whole into the plant to get at the vascular tissue. If the prey resists, the cid'tal
  uses its beak and whine to kill the prey. The whine has a range of 35 meters and
  does 7d6 points of damage. It can be used 1/5 rounds. Remember to check equipment
  damage!It is unknown where the nymphs lair. The adults live for 3-4 weeks during
  the summer. Also the cid'tal appears only once per 17 years (and in great numbers).
