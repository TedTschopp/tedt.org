description: Sea lilies are cousins to starfish. They have a base developed to hold
  strongly onto the bottom in the body of water they dwell (it looks like worms attached
  to a root). Attached to this are dozens of "arms" covered in fine hairs, used to
  catch food. Some species have evolved to survive in fresh water, and most of those
  developed a mass attack to consume large prey. Anything wandering through a sea
  lily patch to attacked once per phase using an enzymatic approach. If the person
  is moving, treat every square meter as a single patch. They do grow up to the waters
  edge, so anyone reaching in the water is also attacked. Their defenses are based
  on the fact that they are submerged; if they are brought up on land, they have no
  armor and are totally defenseless (-4 to ranged /melee attacks).
