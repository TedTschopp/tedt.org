description: These one- to two- meter long fish are a deep brown color with a dull
  yellow underbelly. Weirbuled seemingly have some form of intelli- gence, for they
  are known to cleverly attack only helpless or unsuspecting humans. These creatures
  have stubby teeth in their gaping mouths which enable them to bite for one die (d6)
  of damage. Their real weapons, however, are the three pairs of tentacle-like feelers
  which sprout from either side of their jaw. The longest pair (40 to 80cm) is coated
  with an acidic mucous which causes one die (d6) of damage when a feeler wounds an
  opponent. The other two pairs of tentacle-like appendages are semi-manipulative,
  and, in conjunction with strong pectoral fins and the creature's tail, can be used
  for locomotion, including climbing into vessels with low gunwales. Weirbuled have
  been known to capture small boats by climbing or jumping within, followed by the
  slaying and eating of the occupants. It is reported that truly giant weirbuleds
  of three or more meters length hove been seen, and such creatures would undoubtedly
  have more virulent acids. These reports have not been confirmed, although claims
  of sighting these large creatures persist.
