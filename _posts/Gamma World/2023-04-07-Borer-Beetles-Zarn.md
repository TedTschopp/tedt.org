behavior: They will attack anything regarless of size, spitting an Intensity 16 paralytic
  contact poison up to 6 meters.  Victims must make poison check for each successful
  attack until it is washed off.  Zarns can teleport 60 meters once per round of combat
  and usually do so immediately after each attack.  One a victim is paralyzed a Zarn
  will bore (2d6 damage) into their skulls and lay 1d10+4 eggs.  Eggs will hatch in
  48 hours unless surgically removed.  Newly hatched Zarns immediately eat the remains
  of their eggs and all surrounding tissue.  Zarn Poison remains effective for 1d6
  hours.

combat: "Despite their small size, zarn can be quite dangerous. They attack nearly\
  \ any warm-blooded creature by spitting a powerful paralytic poison up to 5 meters.\
  \ The victim must make a Constitution feat check: Critical Failure results in paralysis\
  \ for d4 days; Failure, 6d4 hours; Ordinary, d4 hours; Good, a +1 penalty to all\
  \ actions for d4 hours; Amazing, no effect. On the following action, the zarn teleports\
  \ to a different location, then spits poison again, continuing until its prey is\
  \ paralyzed. Then it bores through the victim's skull and lays its eggs in its brain.\
  \ The eggs hatch in about a week, killing the victim in the process as the grubs\
  \ consume the brain matter. Zarn eggs can only be removed surgically."
society: Zarn are found thoughtout Gamma Terra and are considered dangerous vermin
  to be wiped out. They're most common in wilderness areas, but they've been known
  to infest more civilized parts before their presence is discovered.
