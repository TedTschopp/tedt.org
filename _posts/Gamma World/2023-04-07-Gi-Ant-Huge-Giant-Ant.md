behavior: 'Ants with 18-20 HD do 2d10 points of damage with their bite, those with
  21-25 do 3d10. If a bite succeeds on an 18+ the ant has grabbed the target. Roll
  d6: 1-3- arms free, 4- one arm held, 5- two arms held, 6- all arms held. One subsequent
  rounds, the ant does bite damage. Only a tough PS check (or the death of the ant)
  will free the target. If the ant does not grab it will use its sting on the target.'
