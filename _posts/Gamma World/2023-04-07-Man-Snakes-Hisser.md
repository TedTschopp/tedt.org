description: A hissers is a 3-meter long mutant snake with a humanoid torso and arms,
  and a snake-like head and lower body. They can rear upright on their powerful tails
  to stand about 1.5 meters off the ground. Hisser scales tend to be green or brown,
  lightening toward the belly and chest area, although some tribes of hissers have
  brightly colored markings.

behavior: They inhabit deserts and ruins and will almost always possess one or more
  artifacts per creature.  Societies are matriarchal with each village having one
  queen and 20d6 male attendants.  Hissers are immune to lasers and sonic blasts.  They
  have no language and use telepathy instead.  One or two individuals in a village
  will known the trade language.  All Hissers will have one additional mental mutation
  in addition to the ones listed here

new_description: With the tail and head of a snake but the torso of a man, Hissers
  often inspire fear in others. Although they only rise to man-height, this conceals
  their great strength and large size (3 meters). Most have heavily tanned skin with
  green to blue-black scales that flash in iridescent colors, although desert dwellersrun
  to rust, brown and tan.
combat: Most Hissers fight with clubs, sonic blast, and mental powers, although 20%
  of any group may have artifacts useful in combat and known how to use them (50%
  chance). They wear no armor, relying on their scales which are both hard and somewhat
  reflective of laser attacks. Half of all hisser patrols are accompanied by packs
  of trained Squeekers. When accompanied by Squeekers, a hisser's Stealth/R.U. drops
  to + 3. Hissers seldom attack alone and are never uncoordinated. They use their
  telepathy to execute precise maneuvers on the battlefield. Groups follow the orders
  of a leader who stays back from the battle, processing the thoughts of the others.
  If this commander is slain, there is a brief period ( 1d6 rounds) of disorganization
  before another hisser assumes control. Hissers appear singly and in small bands,
  usually hunting for food or ancient artifacts, which they prize (although they do
  not always understand them). They tend to be hostile toward other creatures, which
  they regard as food. They're willing to eat other humanoids, which doesn't make
  them many friends. They're intelligent and willing to converse if there is something
  they can gain from it.
society: Hissers are communal creatures. Each village (clutch) is ruled by a brood
  queen; nearly all the Hissers of the village are her children. A nest queen may
  rule several villages which are composed of the offspring of herself and her children.
  Some Hissers have formed nations, such as Huush, ruled by a single grand matriarch,
  known as the Great Mother of Us All. Hisser clutches are commonly located on high
  ground in the swamp. These are silent communities, except for the shrieks of their
  Squeekers (raised for food and defense) since the man-snakes communicate entirely
  by telepathy. Many cannot even speak the most rudimentary languages. They have little
  attachment to artifacts, and tor an appropriate offer, they may sell one that they
  have. However, they do not trust or welcome outsiders. Hissers are intelligent and
  telepathic, living in the arid regions of Gamma Terra. They have no spoken or written
  language and are incapable of sounds other than hissing. Hisser society is matriarchal.
  Each tribe is ruled by a powerful female and made up of a harem of males and young.
  When the tribe grows to sufficient size, the matriach chooses a young female to
  begin a new tribe, taking some of the males with her. Hiss matriarchs are powerful,
  utterly ruthless creatures, dedicated to the good of the tribe.
