description: "Draguns still resemble their ancestral alligator forms, though they\
  \ are much larger and cannot leave the water. They establish territorial areas across\
  \ sea beds, defending them fiercely (even against ships and submarines just passing\
  \ by). Being particularly stupid and rather clumsy, draguns may be slowed and stopped\
  \ by heavy, steel cable nets dropped across their paths. They seem to like basking\
  \ on the surface of the ocean during sunny days, and they are often encountered\
  \ during these times.Draguns possess a rudimentary form of communication consisting\
  \ of bellows, croaks, and grunts, all of which are uttered while the dragun is floating\
  \ on the surface. Mutant reptiles may learn to imitate these sounds with some success\
  \ (50% chance of getting a vocalization correct), and this technique, coupled with\
  \ an amplifier, has been used to attract or drive away these beasts.Draguns have\
  \ three forms of attack. They prefer to bite and swallow prey that is man sized\
  \ or smaller, there being a 15% chance per bite that such prey is gulped down whole.\
  \ A swallowed character takes 2d6 damage per action turn from slow suffocation and\
  \ drowning on water the dragun swallowed, plus an amount equal to his or her base\
  \ AC from digestive acids. The victim may only attack with daggers. claws, or teeth\
  \ against the dragun's insides (AC 9). The dragun must be slain in order for a victim\
  \ to be removed. Once this is done, 100 points of damage must be inflicted on the\
  \ dead dragun's midsection, either by persons outside the dragun or by a swallowed\
  \ victim, to free the captive. Note that a dead dragun floats easily and can be\
  \ towed to land.Draguns also like to ram ships and other creatures that are floating\
  \ on the surface of the water, using their snouts as battering rams. A vessel of\
  \ sailboat size or smaller is 90% likely to capsize if rammed; a ship the size of\
  \ a sailed frigate would have a 5% chance of rolling over.Finally, draguns have\
  \ a New Body Part: a gizzard that collects large stones and can expel them forcefully\
  \ out of the dragun's open mouth. A fired stone weighs 2d4 kilograms, has a 40 meter\
  \ range, and does 6d6 points of damage to whatever it strikes. Draguns only fire\
  \ stones when floating, not underwater. Because of this effect, and because of the\
  \ blasting sound made when the stone is launched, the original name of `dragon'was\
  \ modified to its current form. A dragun has 1d4 such stones which may be fired\
  \ at any particular time.If a dragun senses any sort of poison gas on the water's\
  \ surface, it immediately submerges and flees the area."
