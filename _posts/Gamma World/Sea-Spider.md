description: A giant cross between a crab and spider about 5 meters in size. This
  creature spins sticky webs in areas of sea currents to catch food. It is non- venomous.
  It typically hides in its lair (like a cave or rock outcropping) until its prey
  exhausts itself in the web. Then it goes and picks the victim to pieces with its
  claws while the victim is still stuck fast.  The sea spider is immune to the stickiness
  of the web due to body excretions.
