description: The sarbis looks strikingly like a 2-meter-tall bipedal aardvark. Its
  body is covered with coarse yellow to gray fur, and its face is dominated by a long
  snout. The hands, while manipulative, end in powerful claws good for digging and
  fighting.  Sarbises can be found in almost any terrain except the coldest. Their
  settlements or camps invariably signal the presence of minerals, for the sarbis
  are passionate miners. The camps are a mixture of above and underground constructions.
  Sarbises are paranoid that others (especially other sarbis) might try to 'claim-jump'
  their diggings, so most camps are well defended with stockades and guard towers.
  Attack is made doubly difficult since the ground outside the camp is broken by jagged
  heaps of tailings.  Sarbises rely on trade for food, clothing, and other interesting
  goods. In exchange, they sell refined minerals ingots of pig iron, copper, lead,
  tin, nickel; bags of sulphur, salt, and coal; whatever is useful from the earth.
  Because few others have the talent to dig and smelt these needed metals, sarbises
  are often left unmolested, even in the most hostile territories. Each camp is ruled
  by a strong man, a single leader who achieved his position through bullying and
  threat. All trading in the camp is controlled by the strong man or his minions.
  Sarbises will often buy artifacts useful to mining, sometimes offering other artifacts
  or to make useful implements in exchange.
equipment: ''
reactions: It is the most common type fo I'Xon.  If destroyed, dried for 2 days in
  the sun, mixed with Tabacco and smoked, it will provide the smoker with the equivalencey
  of full resistance to Intensity 9 or less gas or spores for 24 hours.  One wedI'Xon
  makes three doses.
behavior: Varks are not warlike creatures, and mainly prefer to be left alone. They
  favor defensive tactics, especially burrowing out of danger. However, once roused,
  they are tenacious fighters and will continue until death or victory is gained.
  They are quite comfortable with most types of Tech III weaponry and will use it
  to their best advantage. Sarbises are paranoid that others (especially other sarbis)
  might try to 'claim-jump' their diggings, so most camps are well defended with stockades
  and guard towers. Attack is made doubly difficult since the ground outside the camp
