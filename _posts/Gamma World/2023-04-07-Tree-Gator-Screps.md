description: A small, tree-dwelling variety of mutant alligator, screps are bright
  red in color and easily visible among tree foliage. Despite their small size, screps
  are highly intelligent and possess manipulative hands on their fore- limbs as well
  as on their rear legs. Their tails are almost as prehensile as those of spider monkeys.These
  social and friendly creatures live in well-ordered communities among high treetops.
  They contruct nests from twigs, leaves, and stems, and use rudimentary tools to
  hollow out holes in trees for shel- ter. Some screps probably live out their entire
  200-year lifespans without ever touching the ground. Some screps, being curious
  and fascinated by technology, carry small Tech II and Tech III devices and weapons,
  though this is not commonly done.Screps get along especially well with intelligent
  reptilian beings, but few crea- tures want to attack them anyway. This is probably
  due to a unique mutation screps possess, termed friendship generation. This unconscious
  mental mutation oper- ates continuously, and it produces an effect similar to the
  plant mutation allure- ment, in that anyone within its range may be persuaded that
  the mutant is a cher- ished ally who must be protected and defended at all costs.
  This is treated as a mental attack, with the mutants Mental Strength serving as
  both the range of the mutation in meters and the attackstrength. Since the presence
  of several mutants with this power requires individ- ual attack rolls for each,
  those who visit screp communities almost always report that those are the nicest
  places that any- one could ever imagine.Screps do have one enemy a mutant form of
  chuckwalla that has made its way into areas bordering screp forests. This creature
  is not very large, but it is raven- ously carnivorous and possesses a strong form
  of mental shield. Screps hate these creatures, known as guans, and often recruit
  friends to fight them.
