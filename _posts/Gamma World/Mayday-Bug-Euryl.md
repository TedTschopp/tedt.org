description: 'The euryl looks like most aquatic insect larvae: long, thin with the
  legs cramped up near the head. The long antennae, large tusks, and frilly gills
  on its abdomen identify it as a euryl (mutant mayfly). Unlike its ancestors, the
  euryl will remain in its larval state (but still will be able to reproduce). They
  are found in gravelly areas looking for food.'

reactions: ''
behavior: Euryl are non combative, and will not attack things larger than itself unless
  provoked. It uses detect life to sense prey and predators. If attacked it will try
  to flee.Euryl are hunted for food by MA and MH. In some areas they are an important
  farmed animal.
