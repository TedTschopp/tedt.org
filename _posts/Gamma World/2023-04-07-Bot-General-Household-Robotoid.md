mission: To perform household tasks, including cleaning, maintenance, and personal
  attendance.
description: These are the most humanoid looking of all robots. They basically look
  like metal people, and even have facial features. Cameras are mounted in the eye
  holes, and microphones in the ears. The mouth and nose are nonfunctional. These
  robots have hands for manipulators (on 1-meter-long arms) and legs. Both arms and
  legs arc jointed like a human's. Most of the robot's have a low-key, deferential
  male voice. They can be programmed for a variety of local accents.
equipment: The household robot is equipped with a cleaning and polishing attachments,
  maintenance tools, a trash compacter, a vacuum unit (with hose), an incinerator,
  a storage bin and a spray nozzle attached to small tanks of cleaning liquids, disinfectants,
  insecticides, communicator, fire extinguisher, flashlight, voltmeter, external thermometer,
  and hot plate in the palms. It has a replay video screen built into its chest. Generally,
  the house would have re-mote cameras that the robot could monitor or display on
  the same video screen.
reactions: The lowest level of common I.D. card was for children. It allowed them
  a very limited set of commands for the robot. They could not order the robot out
  of their presence. It would not let them engage in harmful activities, even if they
  tried to order it to do so. Adults had higher level common I.D. cards without these
  restrictions. Owners had a supervisor's card and maintenance card. Programmers cards
  were highly restricted and only the manufacturer had them. Household robots would
  obey almost any civil authority card, particularly those from emergency services.
  They ignore security cards. As a rule, the household robot is very polite and will
  perform harmless tasks given it by people that don't even have an I.D. card. However,
  such a request is ignored if the robot has a task, or if it would cause harm to
  people or property, or if it would leave a stranger unattended in what the robot
  considers its home territory.
