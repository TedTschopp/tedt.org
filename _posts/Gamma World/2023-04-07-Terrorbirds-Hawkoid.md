new_description: Hawkoids are mutated forms of sparrowhawks. They grow to a height
  of 1.5 meters and their wingspan is equal to their height. They have many human
  elements, including human-like hands on their wings and legs. These creatures usually
  wear clothing of some sort, and all wear at least a harness for weapons and equipment.
  The feathers of a Hawkoid are predominantly brown, though they have white markings.
  Male hawkoids have beautiful white crescents on the undersides of their wings. They
  often wear light armor (such as leather, studded leather, and other non-bulky, non-metallic
  armor), and most use two weapons, wielding them in their hand-like talons.
combat: Hawkoids are aggressive hunters and will attack almost any reptilian or mammalian
  life form for food. They are nearly fearless. Hawkoids almost always attack first
  by swooping silently down upon their prey, attempting to get in one surprise attack.
  After that, they will usually stay in melee range of a chosen victim, fighting until
  one or the other is dead. If hard pressed, or if a group of prey seemingly has a
  powerful guardian, hawkoids will use their fear generation to drive the biggest
  threat away. Though largely fearless, they are not stupid, and will retreat if their
  lives are threatened. Hawkoids generally have their repulsion fields to protect
  them when they decide to retreat with any victims they have slain.
society: Hawkoids consider Hissers and hoops special delicacies. They will not eat
  carrion. They consider carrins disgusting and will not associate with them. Hawkoids
  seldom land, preferring to levitate even when fighting or talking. The ability to
  fly is so precious to them that if for some reason a Hawkoid loses it, it enters
  a self-induced coma and wills itself to death.
