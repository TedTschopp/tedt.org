behavior: It prefers to feed on freshly killed organic substances and will attack
  animals or characters.  Xanqas can release a slight chemical-electrical charge (I4)
  to anyone within one meter.  If someone touches it with metal gloves or a metal
  weapon, the charge doubles in intenisty.  The charge can go through any armor, except
  force fields.  This discharge is automatic if the plant is touched or attacked at
  range.  Water thrown on the Xanqas will short circut it for 1d8+2 turns.  Acid intensity
  5 or greater will destroy it , as will any chemcical defoliant.
