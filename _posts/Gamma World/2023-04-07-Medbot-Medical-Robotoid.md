description: This upright-walking, 2 meter tall unit is humanoid in shape. It has
  two arms and two 1 meter tentacles, each of which is equipped for handling precision
  instruments. Special equipment includes all normal Medi-kit tools and materials
  (in 5 times the quantity found in a Medi-kit) plus more extensive medical labs than
  are in the Medi-kit. A Medical Robot can perform complex surgery, if necessary.
  It heals characters at the same rate as a Medi-kit (1d10+20 hit points of damage
  to Pure Strain Humans and 1d10+10 hit points of damage to Humanoids and Mutated
  Animals).
