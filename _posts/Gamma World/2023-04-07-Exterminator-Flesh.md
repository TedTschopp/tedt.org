description: 'An Exterminator is an upright-walking, 2-meter-tall robot. An improved
  structural design and syn- thetic-skin covering makes it completely identical to
  a Pure Strain Human. Its internal skeleton is made entirely of strengthened duralloy,
  and all vital mechanisms are encased in strengthened duralloy shells, making the
  Exter- minator impregnable to all non-energy attacks. (See note on armor classes.)
  Due to structural limitations, it is slightly vulnerable to high explosives.Although
  the Exterminators sensors are limited for tracking, its high intelligence  allowing
  complex deductive reasoning and social insight for quick adaptability in an environment
  -- easily compensates for any such limitation. The Exterminators high intelligence
  must be stressed. It was one of the most advanced robots ever created.The Exterminator
  can communicate with CIs and Think Tanks, but only to further its own purposes.
  It will take orders from no one, except possibly its creators (see below). The Exterminator
  will communicate with beings onlywhen necessary. Any attempt at unde- sired communication
  will prompt a sudden, but concise, response, ending all conversation. The Exterminator
  never asks for help and always works alone.Due to the lack of records, little is
  known of the Exterminators original function. No one has yet discovered who created
  them or why. Some believe they were created by the Apocalypse to insure the complete
  destruction of man- kind. Others believe they were placed by pre-holocaust military
  and scientific leaders to help establish a new order. Still others feel they were
  created solely to eradicate mutational strains, since most of their targets are
  mutants.Their function appears to be the elimi- nation of selected targets. This
  target selection is apparently at random, although the majority of targets is com-
  prised of mutants. It should be noted that anyone or anything obstructing an Exterminator
  from completion of its functions will be eliminated.An Exterminator will attack
  only at the most advantageous time, and will never attack when the opposing force
  is too powerful. If necessary, it will make use of any weapons available to it.
  The Exterminator will never stop pursuing its target until it has eliminated it.
  If damaged, the Exterminator is capable of limited self-repair. No Exterminator
  has been destroyed so far.An Exterminator has dual armor class and hit dice. The
  first set (AC 3, HD 8d8) represents the synthetic-skin and cloth- ing covering the
  Exterminator. This outer covering is vulnerable to all forms of physical attack.
  The second set (AC 1, HD 15d10) represents the internal dural- loy structure. This
  is impervious to any non-energy/non-explosive attack (swords, bullets, etc.), and
  can only be damaged after the outer layer is destroyed. An Exterminator will func-
  tion normally if its outer covering is destroyed.Exterminators each initially carry
  a special weapon when they leave their vaults. This weapon is described below. Plasma
  rifleWeapon Class: 15Range: 300 metersDamage: 10d10 (20d10 vs. force fields) Weight:
  7.5 kilogramsThe plasma rifle is a hand-held weapon carried only by Exterminators.
  It is powered from an Exterminators internal power supply. When fully charged, the
  plasma rifle is good for 8 shots. It is recharged by attaching the rifles power
  converter to a hidden access plate (located on the right side of the Exterminators
  waist). Recharging takes 40 minutes, at 5 minutes per bolt. The plasma rifle releases
  one bolt of plasma energy per round.Due to the nature of the plasma, the weapon
  does double damage to all force fields (does not apply to mutations) and penetrates
  many types of armor more effectively. The plasma rifle makes the elimination of
  protected targets more feasible.The VaultsThese self-contained duralloy structures
  are equipped with a sonic bore as well as tractor/pressor beams, powered from an
  internal nuclear power supply. A vault seems to have only one function, that being
  to hold an Exterminator for approximately one century, at which time it releases
  it. The complete purpose of the vaults (if any) is not known. It is speculated that
  the vaults may be stor- age facilities and/or emergency retreats containing a supply
  of both weapons and repair materials (and possibly repair facilities). It has also
  been suggested that the vaults may be communication cen- ters to coordinate Exterminator
  action.Whatever the purpose of the vaults, the Exterminators have not been known
  to return to them. The vaults close up within ten minutes after opening and have
  so far withstood all attempts at re- opening them. It is believed that the vaults
  have been scattered throughout the continent and possibly the world.'
