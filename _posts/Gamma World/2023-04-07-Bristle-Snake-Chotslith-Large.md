description: The Choslith is a mutated snake that is covered in 5 - 10 inch needle-like
  spikes. It is a constrictor and attacks by enveloping its prey and constricting
  around them.  Once it has wrapped itself once around the prey it will start to bite
  it as well.  The Choslith hunt by smell and are just a deadly at dark as in the
  light of day.  They are found in all climates except arctic.

behavior: The Choslith will roll to hit with the coils and if it is successful it
  will have ensnared its victim.  The following turn the Choslith will attempt one
  additional coil per turn up to the maximum.  Each coil will do its damage individually.  To
  remove a coil the victim must roll a Strength Context.  The Chotslith has a +4 modifier
  to that roll.
