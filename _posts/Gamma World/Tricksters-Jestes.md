description: These short, elfin- looking humans are well known for the practical jokes
  they play on unwary travelers. They live in dense forests, making their homes in
  hollowed-out tree trunks, and feed upon locally gathered fruits, nuts, berries,
  roots, leaves, and other edible plant matter. Jestes use their confusion, illusion
  generation, and density control mutations to cause wayfarers trouble. Of course,
  speed increase and chameleon powers prove useful when jestes need to hide. If a
  jeste is hurt by an angry victim of a joke, others will retaliate with their gamma
  eyes.If characters laugh along with the jestes practical jokes, they will reveal
  themselves and help the characters if they can, though they will still play tricks
  now and then. Jestes are curious by nature, and can often be coaxed into joining
  a party of adventurers. They will always be loyal companions, though they will still
  joke around when the party is not in a dangerous situation. Jestes encountered in
  the wild will have 1-4 items of Tech Level II. These will be items that they are
  able to handle with ease (for example, pistols instead of rifles).Jestes enjoy the
  company of friendly mutant animals, grens, and wardents. They dislike androids greatly
  and hate robots, reserving their more malicious tricks for these two groups of beings.
