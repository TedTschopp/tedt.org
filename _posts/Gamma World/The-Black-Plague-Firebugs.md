description: These vicious and destructive pests delight in ravaging fields cultivated
  by humans and humanoids. They attack anyone or anything that tries to interfere
  with them. They can bite, but more frequently they spit a glob of highly volatile,
  Greek-fire-like liquid that ignites on contact with open air. It hits any unob-
  structed target within 8 m and burns for 2d6 damage (unless the target is immune
  to heat and fire). It continues to burn for 5 Action Turns, doing 2d6 damage per
  turn, unless it is smothered out. To do this, the creature must roll on the ground
  for a full Action Turn; water (excepting full immer- sion) or cyrokinesis wont put
  out this fire. Firebugs can spit this liquid once every four Action Turns. The bodies
  of firebugs are also very hot, and any creature touch- ing them takes 1d4 damage  the
  extent of their heat generation powers.Most communities plagued by firebugs resign
  themselves to the loss of part of their grain. But firebugs are destructive by inclination
  as well as by ecological niche. They sometimes burn a field or attack a harmless
  passer-by out of sheer vicious- ness. They are also extraordinarily vindic- tive
  and typically respond to the loss of a fight by burning down the nearest village.
  Firebugs are also arrogant and seldom retreat from a fight. When they do flee, they
  are nearly impossible to catch, even though flightless, as they put up their force
  fields and hop 50 m in one jump, 5 times per Action Turn (ten times at fast speed).Firebugs
  are glossy black in color, with orange-red eyes like burning coals.
