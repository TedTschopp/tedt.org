  a vicious bite that converts flesh to silver. After the prey to totally converted
  to silver, the  Thy'tal eats the body. One out of every 4 animals is not converted
  to silver.  Thy'tal are sometimes used by evil, greedy people to convert prisoners
  into silver. Its life cycle is unknown as all are attacked unpon sight. A dead  Thy'tal
  yields 200-500kg of silver.
