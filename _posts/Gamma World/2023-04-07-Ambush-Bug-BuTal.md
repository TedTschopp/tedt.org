description: Ambush bugs can vary slightly in color.  Some are golden yellow and brown,
  while others are more green.  The sides of the body are raised and the shoulder
  plate looks rigid and bumpy. Males are physically smaller than females and can often
  be seen riding on their mate's back. Females will lay bunches of fertilized eggs
  on trees and cover them in a frothy coating, which may offer protection from desiccation
  as well as predation.

behavior: These are mutant ambush bugs. They are stout bodied with greatly enlarged
  forelegs like a manta (green render). The abdomen is much wider than the wings at
  that point. They are green-brown, and though 3 meters long, they are only .5 meters
  tall.They hide using chameleon power and a silence field. When prey carrying metal
  objects comes within 10 meters of the bu'tal, it uses magnetic control to draw the
  prey closer. It attacks as a manta. If the prey struggles, it uses hot hands to
  kill the prey quickly.Bu'tal feed on the blood of most anything, but prefers those
  who wear metal objects (ie PCs and NPCs)

combat: The grace and beauty of these tiny beings hides their incredible roughness
  They will avoid combat as much as possible, preferring to use their vast array of
  mutations to protect themselves and drive opponents away. If forced into close melee
  combat they are essentially helpless. Lils often use tiny bows and arrows which
  do 1 point of damage if they hit successfully, but are dipped in intensity 15 sleep
  poison. This poison functions like paralytic poison, but never goes above Stage
  III. Stage III is 'asleep.' It lasts an hour.
