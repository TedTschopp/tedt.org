  the autobot was a popular but fragile companion for the pre-holocaust humans.
description: Autobots are 1 meter tall personal servant robots.  They body is constructed
  of a plastic shell with hydraulic muscles and solid state circuitry.  they may either
  possess three legs or three wheeled struts which are used for locomotion and balance.
equipment: Plugin tools pertinent to programmed tasks such as vacuum hoses, flame
  throwers, drills, water and wax jets, buffers, vibrosaws. infant changing stations,
  etc...
reactions: Due to their fragile nature, few Autobots survived the holocaust, and those
  that did have exhausted their batteries (unless they have been replaced since then).
  In spite of their rarity, the Autobot in its deactivated and powerless state is
  the most commonly revered ancient artifact in the temples of the Archivist cryptic
  alliance
behavior: Autobots will have plug-in power tools pertinent to their programmed task
  attached to compartments in their midsection.  these tools can be attached to and
  powered by the two robotic arm jacks.  Such tools include vacuum hoses, flame throwers,
  drills, water and wax jets, buffers, vibrosaw, and so forth.  Few Autobots have
  survived the holocaust, and most need new batteries.
