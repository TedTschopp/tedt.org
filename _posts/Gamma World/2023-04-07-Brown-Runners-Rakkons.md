description: The bandit-masked rakkons may be found in the mountainous regions of
  North America. They resemble bears, though they are not aggressive and do not eat
  meat. It is rumored that some humanoid tribes use them as steeds. Rakkons stand
  1.5 m at the shoulder, but may stand up on their rear legs to a height of 3.5m.
  They have short, bushy tails and are silvery-gray in color.The fur of the rakkon
  is actually photo- synthetic, manufacturing nutrients as per the regular mutation.
  However, the furs thickness serves as protection, so that the rakkon does not suffer
  extra damage if attacked by cold-using weapons or muta- tions. Rakkons remain continuously
  active throughout the day and night, and do not appear to need sleep, though they
  have to rest from great exertion like any other animal. Dabbers (brown beggars)
  do not care for rakkons and never employ them as pets or steeds. Rakkons otherwise
  enjoy some popularity as pets among those who like big, shaggy, inoffensive creatures.
  Trained rakkons are excellent with children.
