description: The entire body of a sucslith, usually over 6 feet long, is covered with
  sucker like discs and barbed tendrils. The snake's ability to crawl anywhere is
  amazing (equal to its land speed on any surface but liquid, which reduces its speed
  by half). It prefers to climb up to a vantage point, usually about 3m above the
  surface and stay there indefinitely until prey comes along. It is a chameleon and
  can match its surrounding coloration in 5 turns.

behavior: The sucslith is able to fast for weeks, and can recycle its body fluids,
  negating the necessity of moving to find moisture. When attacking, the sucslith
  normally uses its web first. This web can work in one of two ways. Either it can
  be used to catch" a small target (range 6m) or it can clog up a 3m area. This second
  type of web is sufficiently thick enough to slow the movement of anyone in the affected
  area to half speed, except for the sucslith itself, which has no difficulty moving
  through its own or another suslith's web. The web has a strength of 20.  Oftentimes
  this intelligent snake will lay down its thick web underneath rotting floorboards
  or during a leaf fall, knowing it will be camouflaged. It will then perch at a vantage
  point above the webbed area and wait for a good sized victim to come along. Once
  the creature is slowed down by the ground web, the sucslith will cover it with another
  web, thus preventing its prey from seeing or using its appendages for combat. Then,
  the sucslith drops down on the hapless victim and enters the web, biting until the
  creature is dead. Unfortunately, sucsliths can be found anywhere, though they tend
  to avoid deserts and deathlands.
