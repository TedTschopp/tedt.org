description: Prot eps are the most ancient of trees, surviving the original holocaust
  by constantly adapting until they could not be killed. Prot eps cannot take damage
  from any kind of attack, natural or artificial. No disease, insect, or plant life
  can affect them. Their roots are like steel cables travelling miles below the ground.
  They cannot be knocked over, torn up, or driven into the ground. They have bark
  like a birch, leaves like a maple, but are pure white in color, and grow to the
  shape and size of an old oak.  Chemical defoliants, radiation, or antimatter will
  wither all the vegetation around them but cannot even change their color. They only
  die of old age, and that is after thousands of years.  Some civilizations revere
  them as gods, others build their villages around their trunks or in their branches.
  There is no safer place for a party of adventurers to camp overnight than in the
  branches of a prot ep, as attacks cannot usually penetrate the foliage surrounding
  them and very few dangerous creatures seem to be able to live or hunt in them (usually
  snakes can survive).
