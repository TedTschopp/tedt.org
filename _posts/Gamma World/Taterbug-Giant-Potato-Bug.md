description: These giant, docile herbivores roam the vast overgrown grasslands of
  Gamma Terra, and are comparable to the large herds of buffalo that once roamed the
  plains of America. These animals typically have no mutations other than their large
  size.

behavior: So large and well armored that they have few natural enemies, these animals
  have been adapted into war-mounts by many societies. A odd saddle with rails that
  run parallel to the bottom of the beast , (wrapping under the segmented armor plates
  to prevent it from rolling into a ball) is fitted at the apex of the creatures back.
  A pair of barbed spikes is inserted under the first segment of armored plate, between
  the head and the torso of the animal. Reins are attached to these spikes to facilitate
  guiding the animal, just as with a more traditional steed. A set of stirrups dangle
  from the saddle and are connected by chains to the trailing edge of the rails. By
  pulling forward on these stirrups the creature is encouraged to move forward. These
  creatures are very fast, about half the speed of a centisteed, at full speed.If
  attacked, a herd will run in a random direction. If one runs over a creature (less
  than 3m tall and it must make a To- Hit roll), it inflicts 4d10 points of damage.Giant
  potato bugs (or sow bugs or pill bugs) are very important to the plains ecosystem.
  They are hunted by specialized carnivores (like the Ti'tal and the obb) that can
  break through the bugs' armor.
