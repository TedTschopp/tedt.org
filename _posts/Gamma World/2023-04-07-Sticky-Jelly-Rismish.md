description: Rismish comes in a variety of colors, but is always opague.  It usally
  can be found on the floors and walls of tunnels or corridors.  It resembles huge
  patches of jelly smeared on the walls.  It cannot move to attack and has no range
  attack, but its surface is deadly.
equipment: ''
reactions: Old herbal healers know that burned residue from a rismish can be mixed
  with water in a 5 to 1 ration to produce a healing potion that restores 1d12 hit
  points, no matter how the damage was caused. One cremated rismish can produce 2
  such potions
behavior: The rismish is covered by an extremely strong, adhesive ichor that acts
  as 17 Strength for holding anything merely touching it, as 19 for anything pushed
  into it (such as a weapon attack), or 21 for anything falling into it.  A creature
  or character who falls face first into rismish will be unable to breathe (treat
  as drowning)  Rishmish can only be harmed by fire, and then only take 1/4 the usual
  damage.  A character held fast to a rismish that is being burned will take half
  damage from the fire for a maximum of two actions.
