Mission: ''
Description: A twisted, ugly head lies atop the hill.  it is with shock that you realize
  the head is actually 10 meters tall.  Long, greasy strands of brown hair flow down
  a hundred meters from the head in all directions.  The face is barely human, covered
  in mottled green and brown.  The cavernous nose is covered with a strange, fuzzy
  growth; the eyes are closed.  The creature's body, if any exists, is buried deep
  in the hill.

Behavior: Tehwhisz is a mutated plat of sorts.  The head is connected to a root system
  that extends for two and a half kilometers.  She is the final arbiter of disputes
  among the inhabitants of the Old Place.  All discussions of any importance between
  hostile nations take place on Judgement Top.  Nobody knows if Tehwhisz has any other
  mutations or abilities then the ones listed here.  Her purpose and goals are hidden.  If
  asked, she is willing to act as arbiter between groups.  agreements signed in her
  presence are always done so honestly.  Tehwhisz can usually identify any contrary
  intention or lie.  The Judge is free to use Tehwhisz for any purposes, create new
  powers, or add more to those which already exist in her arsenal.
