combat: Crep plants feed on other living creatures using their Life Leech mutation.
  They generally trap a creature with their tendrils, then drain its life force. The
  crep uses the drained life force to seed, dropping off mobile seeds that burrow
  into the ground to become new crep plants. Crep uses their tendrils the defend themselves
  and ward off predators. In desparate situations they use their Death Field mutation
  for defense.
society: Crep are found in still freshwater, along shores, and in moist, temperate
  climates. They migrate slowly, killing off local animal life and leaving a "trail"
  of crep seedlings in their path. Immature crep plants grow rooted for a season before
  gaining mobility and moving off on their own in search of prey.
