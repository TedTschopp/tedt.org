Mission: ''
Description: Win Seen are ground covering creepers that can spread to cover a large
  area (as much as 20 meters in diameter)  The blue-green land variety covers shady
  areas of ground and grows in groups which are so entangled that is difficult to
  tell where one plant beigns and another leaves off.

Reactions: ''
Behavior: The Green Win Seen gives off an order that encourages carnivores to live
  nearby and has primative magnetic control.  The new growth vines on a plant may
  be picked, chopped, and boiled into doses of Intensity 14 poison antidote.

New_Description: ''
Combat: 'Win seen are not intelligent, but they have their own defense mechanisms
  to protect them from predators. Water win seen emit a sonic blast when touched by
  another creature. Land win seen are covered with a contact irritant. Characters
  touching it must make a Constitution feat check: Critical Failure results in a +3
  penalty on all actions for 2 rounds; Failure, +2 penalty for 2 rounds; Ordinary,
  +1 penalty for 2 rounds; Good or Amazing, no effect. Land win seen also exhibit
  a crude form of magnetic control, forcing all ferrous objects near them to the ground.'
Society: Win seen are largely harmless when left alone. They're edible and quite nutritious.
  A single win seen can be chopped up and cooked down to yield a thick paste that
  serves as a poison antidote. A dose of it swallowed or applied to a poisoned wound
  provides a -2 step bonus on the Constitution feat check. A single plant yields ten
  doses of the antidote.
