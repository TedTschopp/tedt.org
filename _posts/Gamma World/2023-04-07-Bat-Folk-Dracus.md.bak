description: Dracs are mutant, humanoid-shaped bats, with hollow bones and wings allowing
  them to fly normally. Their hands form part of their wings, so they cannot grasp
  an item and fly at the same time.At night dracs go in search of mamma- lian prey,
  locating it from the air and surrounding their victims with fog using weather manipulation.
  They will then use infravision to aim sonic blasts at their victims while staying
  out of reach. If cornered, they will use their fear generation talent to defend
  themselves. They will flee rather than fight, if at all possible. After a victim
  is dead or dis- abled, dracs will land and use their hollow fangs to draw all the
  blood from the bodies, draining 1d4 hit points per action turn from living victims
  until twice the number of hit points a victim possesses has been drained (leaving
  the victim dead and without any blood).It has been suspected that dracs were purposefully
  engineered by unknown beings, given their strong resemblance to the Ancients concept
  of vampires. Whether or not this is so remains to be seen. They do not appear to
  work for any higher power.Dracs will usually not carry any tools or equipment, though
  a rare one, usually the leader of a hunting pack, will have some equipment of Tech
  Level II. Dracs will only associate with their own kind. They will never become
  hirelings or followers.
