description: Grens look like Green skinned pure strain humans.  However, Grens are
  mutant humans with entirely green skin, hair, and eye pigment due to their photosyntheic
  skin. They have no body hair except on their heads and tend to wear little clothing
  so that light can reach their skin.

reactions: ''
behavior: Grens hate ancient technology and never keep artifacts.  They carry Tech
  Level 1 gear. They don't use armor.  They live at peace with nature, and shun outsiders
  desiring a peaceful existence.  They will help PSH 30% of the time.  A community
  consists of 1d6 * 20 occupants.  They are guarded by 1d6 domesticated Blackuns,
  gators, Kai Lins, or Obbs for every 10 grens.  Grens keep Ert Teldens as Catapult
  ammunition.  When away from their community, they are not accompanied by their guardians.

new_description: Grens look like pure strain humans except for their dark green skin.
  Hair color ranges from brown to green, though a few rare individuals have blond
  hair. Grens wear a minimum of clothing, usually something made from leaves and grass.
combat: A gren's skin color allows him to blend in with natural surroundings. If a
  gren is outside his normal forest environment, his Stealth/Remain Unseen bonus does
  not apply.  Though normally peaceful, grens will defend their homes with spears,
  staves, and other primitive weapons if necessary. They never wear armor or use equipment
  above Tech Level I, and hate and shun ancient technology. Gren communities are often
  guarded by domesticated animals or intelligent plants, usually blackuns, gators,
  kal lins, or obbs. A typical tribe has 1d4 + 2 of a single type of these creatures.
  Other community defenses include snares and pit traps, and a few settled tribes
  have primitive catapults.Grens are a reclusive people, living in deep forests away
  from others. They rarely make contact with outsiders, sometimes trading at outposts
  on the edges of the forest. They're only hostile to intruders in their territory.
  Because of their isolation, some Grens don't speak Anglish, but most do.
society: Grens are normally nomadic, living as simple hunter-gatherers in forests
  and jungles. Some tribes have settled and expanded, however. These communities consist
  of 20-80 (1d4 X 20) members. Communities form only in very isolated areas. Settled
  grens still hunt and gather food, but they also tend any food plants which grow
  within their communities. They are careful to not harm the local ecology, trying
  to hvc in harmony with nature. Grens are also remarkably adept with animals and
  can train even the most stubborn of creatures, such as gators. This training ability
  also applies to semi-intelligent plants and funguses Creatures are domesticated
  solely for the use of the community and are never kept as personal guardians or
  pets. Grens are very insular but sometimes help friendly pure strain humans.Gren
  villages are primitive and they disdain all but Gamma Age technology. Since they
  don't need to hunt or farm for their food, their day-to-day life is fairly idyllic,
  save for warding off predators and other hazards. They often build their homes among
  the treetops, away from the dangers on the forest floor.
