description: Mingos are birdlike creatures descended from Flamingos. They are now
  more at home in the water than they are on land. Mingos travel in groups to hunt
  down their meals, often looking like a large school of long legged fish when encountered
  underwater. They still retain the ability to hunt while standing along shores, but
  find prey easier to catch in the open sea. They no longer have the capability to
  fly because of their water adaptations. They have been known to attack humans/humanoids
  when hungry.
