new_description: Brutorz are mutated percherons (a breed of horse). Their shoulders
  are level with a human's head. Their coloring ranges from pure white to jet-black
  and from soft beige to chocolate brown. A proud animal, the brutorz's head sits
  high on its massive neck, and its long flowing tail stands out from its body.
combat: The brutorz prefers peaceful coexistence with other animals and intelligent
  plants, but it never backs down from a fight when peaceful options are exhausted.
  These massive beasts attack with a bite or with two kicks with their front legs.
  If attacked from the back, the brutorz can strike with its two back hooves. As an
  attack of last resort, the brutorz can trample with his four feet, causing 3d6 points
  of damage per hoof. (The GM should roll a 1d4 to determine how many hooves strike
  the opponent). The brutorz uses its intuition and telepathy to great advantage in
  combat. It always seems to known what an opponent is going to do before he does
  it. Frequently, brutorz taunt their enemies telepathically, trying to get them to
  break and run.
society: Brutorz live in herds, much like their ancestors. While they are smart enough
  to use technology, they disdain its use. They also lack the opposable manipulative
  digits needed to effectively use most technology. They live to run free and wild.
  If approached in a congenial manner, a brutorz may befriend a humanoid. Brutorz
  refuse to ally with humanoids and creatures who do not respect them. In a like manner,
  characters who plan to use a brutorz for their own means, without a thought toward
  the creature, can never hope to gain the brutorz as an ally. Brutorz willingly serve
  as draft animals, but refuse bits. bridles, or confining harnesses. They have a
  PS of 26 and can carry three normal men comfortably
