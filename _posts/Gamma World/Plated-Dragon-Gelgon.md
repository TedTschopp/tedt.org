description: (Pet) Sho'day are nocturnal birds that avoid confrontation and are extremely
  curious.   They will circle low over encampments and sometime 'buzz' them to get
  a better look at those sitting around the campground.  They love hot food of any
  kind.  If the campground has any, and the campers are friendly, they will attempt
  to land.  The Sho'day nest in trees and tall rocks and soar to incredible heights
  when hunting, they usually hunt small mammals or fish.  They have incredible sight,
  are completely black, and have a wingspan of over 6 feet.
equipment: Gelgon loves to hoard metallic items, expecially weapons.

combat: The Gelgon will attack with its mental blast, while using Magnetic Control
  to stip the party of their weapons.  Once they are stripped of their weapons, the
  Gelgon will attempt to use the metal armor the attackers are carrying to hold them
  at range.  As the Gelgon is immunce to physcial damage, this is effective against
  all but the most high tech attackers.
society: Solitary until mating season.  Then two Erdgon's will seek each other out
  and mate.  A female will ensure the eggs are hidden well underground and protect
  the clutch until they are ready to hatch.  The mother will then leave the clutch
  a day or two before the eggs hatch.
