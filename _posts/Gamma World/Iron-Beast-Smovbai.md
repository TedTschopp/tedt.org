description: (Mount) The Smovbai is a short, six legged reptile with a brown plated
  body and mottled grey head.  It resembles a small triceratops without horns.  It
  has a plate / crest around its head that can flare out when the Smovbai wishes it,
  and allow the rider to sit on the neck.  Once in position the rider is considered
  to be better protected from all attacks that don't come from the front.  The Smovbai
  are found around swamps, marshy areas, along rivers and lakes and other areas where
  there is a lot of standing water.

behavior: Any creature 7.5' tall may ride a Smobai.  When riding a Smovbai a character
  is considered to have +2 AC.  When charging and trampling the victim who is successfully
  hit has a -2 AC each to the next round in an attempt to continue the attack.  If
  the target fails this, then they lose their movement and take another Charge and
  trample attack.
