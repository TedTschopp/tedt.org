new_description: 'These intelligent man-dogs grow to be 3 meters high when standing
  on their hind feet. Their hands have adapted to tool use. Their coarse, heavy fur
  offers substantial protection from the elements. They run the gamut of colors: brown,
  black, white, blond, spotted, multihued, etc. Arks carry Tech Level II weapons:
  swords, spears, bows, and such. They most commonly wear leather or studded leather
  armor most commonly, and have rarely been seen without a shield of some sort. Their
  pack insignia is usually emblazoned upon their shields.'
combat: The arks' primary strategy is to attack from an ambush with guerrilla tactics,
  using their life leech mutation as much as possible. Since they are not immune to
  this power themselves, they life leech each other as well as the enemy in combat.
  However, their life leeching of each other tends to cancel itself out, so ignore
  it in large fights. They have an unreasonable fear of flying creatures larger than
  1 meter.
society: The hound folk travel in loosely knit family units called packs. These packs
  can be up to two dozen members strong, but the hunting parties rarely number more
  than a dozen. The pack is ruled by the alpha male, usually the ark with the most
  combat prowess. Other males will occasionally challenge the alpha male for the right
  to rule the pack. Sometimes a large pack will split, with part of it following a
  new alpha male and part of it staying with the old one. Arks fear all Tech Ill and
  IV artifacts, Ignore them if rolled as loot. However, Tech V and VI artifacts are
  worshipped as totems. The alpha male's first wife is charged with the care and transportation
  of the totems. They consider human hands to be a great delicacy.
