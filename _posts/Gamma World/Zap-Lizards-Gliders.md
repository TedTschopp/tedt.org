description: Gliders are large lizards which possess extraordinary powers of concealment.
  They are carnivorous in nature, and their forelegs have developed into broad wings,
  which they use to swoop down on their prey. Gliders cannot truly fly, but can descend
  upon a victim in a silent glide that adds a +2 bonus to oppo- nents chances of being
  surprised (even with heightened hearing). This glide can be extended for twice as
  far a distance as the gliders altitude at the time it takes off; e.g., a glider
  starting at a height of 20 m can glide down to prey on the ground 40 m away. Gliders
  climb extremely well using their back legs and winged forearms, each of which has
  a free claw useful only for hooking into tree bark to hold position. Gliders may
  be found at any altitude to which trees can grow. They avoid sailing out over bodies
  of water, as they cannot swim. Though of animal-like intelligence, gliders rarely
  bother creatures which possess considerable amounts of Tech II or Tech III equipment,
  perhaps because they dislike the smell produced by such items. Gliders often can
  be caught when young and raised as pets. Native jungle inhabit- ants have also lived
  in peace with gliders, feeding them on scraps and employing them as guards for villages.
  Gliders possess a low-grade form of radiation eyes (2d6 Intensity Level radia- tion
  per shot) that is emitted as beams of green laser light. They use this attack only
  against large creatures, and never against creatures they intend to eat.
