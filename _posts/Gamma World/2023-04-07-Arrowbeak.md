description: Their coloration is normally dark brown, with a light brown patch on
  their chest (bright red in the case of the non-aggressive males).  Arrowbeaks have
  a primitive organization, with a flock consisting of several mated pairs,with the
  oldest female as the leader. Chicks are raised communally, maturing after 2 years.
  They are quite peaceful during summer and autumn, even allowing travellers to camp
  under their roosts, as long as they are quiet and unobtrusive.

behavior: During the spring mating season, these mutated robins are one of the most
  dangerous avian Life forms known in the Gamma World, due to their requirement to
  ingest several pints of mammalian blood for each egg produced. Their chameleon power
  is usually only used in combat. The usual tactics used by arrowbeaks is for the
  males in a flock to cause a distraction ahead of a group of victims, while the females
  dive in and attack from behind. As they use their chameleon power and glide silently
  during their attack, they are very difficult to detect (sonar or infravision usually
  work). They will attack separate targets, unless there are fewer targets than attackers.
  After a target has been paralyzed, the attacking arrowbeak will suck blood from
  the target for 5 rounds, then fly off to roost and deliver an egg. If an attacker
  fails, she will generally harass the party to protect the successful individuals.
  Males will not usually participate in combat except when attacked.
