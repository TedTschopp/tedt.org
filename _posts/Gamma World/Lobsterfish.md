description: These look like a 20-50 cm long seabass with 8 spiny legs sticking out
  of their sides. They are nearly harmless, but can be annoying. They sometimes (1
  in 4) mindlessly attack anything that moves. On a roll of natural 20 they score
  1 point of damage. They are rather tasty if cooked.
