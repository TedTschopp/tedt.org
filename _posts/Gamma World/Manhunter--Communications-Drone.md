description: These data-probes are used to send televised pictures of areas that the
  robot is investigating, for general tracking and surveying missions. They are used
  to scout areas before alerting the Manhunter to send out the cybers or have the
  Manhunter come itself. The probes are equipped and fitted for underwater use. The
  armor given combines the probes speed and size, and the number given in parentheses
  indicates the armor class while the probes are stationary (hovering). The probes
  can be controlled by the Manhunter up to a distance of 10 kilome- ters, and they
  automatically return if a distance greater than this is indicated. The probes have
  radar- and infravision-jam- ming screens (which even affect muta- tions) that allow
  them to pass by unnoticed.The probes are also equipped with an electrical defense
  shield that does 1d10 hp damage to characters touching them. The probes themselves
  cannot attack, and flee as soon as they have registered the posi- tion of the desired
  hiding group.
