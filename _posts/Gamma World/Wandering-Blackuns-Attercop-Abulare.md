description: Attercops, also known as Blackuns, are mutated garden spiders.  They
  have long bristles across their bodies, making them unpalatable prey to all but
  the largest creatures.  They have 12 eyes located all over their head, giving them
  360 degree sight.

new_description: Attercops Abulare, also known as Wandering Blackuns, are mutated
  garden spiders.  They have long bristles across their bodies, making them unpalatable
  prey to all but the largest creatures.  They have 12 eyes located all over their
  head, giving them 360 degree sight.
combat: The attercop attacks with a bite, causing 1d4 damage.  As the teeth hit their
  mark, the creature uses its electrical generation to jolt the prey.  Once its victim
  stops moving the attercop trusses it in stick webbing, Creatures held in this manner
  must make a DC 10 Strength Check to escape.  Attercops keep their prey as long as
  four days before they settle down to feed.  Because of the creatures extraordinarily
  high Mental strength, the attercop is completely immune to all mental attacks except
  illusions.  These mental attacks always succeed.  The Attercop Abulare is an active
  hunter, preferring to use its web only to shackle its prey before eating them or
  moving on.
society: The attercop is a solitary hunter, allowing no others of its kind within
  its web or territory except during fall breeding, Female Attercops deposit a half-meter
  diameter egg sac containing over 1000 young.  Blights, bloodbirds and carrins hunt
  these young Attercops, liking all but a few dozen before they are large enough to
  defend themselves.  The Attercop's flame resistant web sometimes stretches over
  an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures captured in the web need to make a
  DC 5 strength check to escape.  Any loot found in an Attercop's web is merely indigestible
  waste to the spider.  The Lil, commonly take refuge within or behind attercop webs,
  although some fall prey to the spider.
