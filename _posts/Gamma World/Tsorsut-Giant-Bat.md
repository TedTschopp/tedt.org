Description: The Tsorsut is a huge creature descendant from a foxbat.  It hunds both
  night and day and is smart enough to stay away from people, but will lsometimes
  run into them at night whe it is looking for its favorite food, the Blassut.  It
  is at this time that most attacks on people take place for if the Tsorsut can not
  catch a Blassut easily, it will snatch anything else up that is edible including
  people.  They usually nest in ravines, canyons, and large caves or trees  Bu'daan
  prefer them as food.

Behavior: The first attack roll is to determine if the creature successfully grabs
  its target.  Once grabbed, the bite is automatic and it is the bite that causes
  the damage.  To break free the PC must roll +2 better than the Trorst on opposed
  strength rolls.  Once grabbed, the creature will fly away to a high roosting placeto
  feast.  The Sonic Blast will be used on Blassut and it this attack will completely
  blind the Blassut for 5 rounds.  If used against others it will do 3d6 damage and
  has a range of 30 meters and effects everything within 7 meter radius.  The Tosrsut
  will wait 5 rounds before using that attack again.  Tsorsut will always counter
  attack with attacked, and will continue to do so until they are certain any attackers
  are cowe.
