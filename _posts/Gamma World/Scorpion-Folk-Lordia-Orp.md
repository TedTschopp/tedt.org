  of claws that it uses very well. The first pair of legs have mutated to large arms
  and the second pair of legs have also mutated to arms, though smaller than the first.
  The Lorida Orp has two tails.

behavior: The Lorida Orp has two tails, one has enom causing paralysis for 1d20 rounds
  and the venom of the other tail causes death.The Lorida orps are very fond of guns,
  knives, swords, and axes of all Tech levels. They will go to great lengths to obtain
  ancient weapons. The Lorida Orp, if able, will attack a foe from afar with any firearm
  it may have; and then it will engage its prey in hand to hand combat using any weapon
  it may on hand and it will also use its natural weaponry.As a whole, Lorida orps
  are xenophobic as several races consider their young to be a delicacy. However,
  there are two races that the Lorida orps get along with; the spider lill and the
  drax (see next issue). Also, there is the rare Lorida Orp that seeks to venture
  from its familiar surroundings and lead the life of an adventurer.Lorida Orp encounters
  are usually with a male patrol, any one unfortunate enough to find a base camp will
  have to deal with very irate and protective females and even the young will fight.
  If any children are killed the Lorida Orp tribe will track the wrong doers back
  to their village and kill any adult they find as well as burn everything.
