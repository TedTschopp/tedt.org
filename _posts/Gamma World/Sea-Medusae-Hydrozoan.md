description: Hydrozoans are two meter tall jellyfish-like creatures. They are of a
  particularly evil nature and consider themselves the most superior form of life
  on the planet. Because of this all other life forms fall into two categories, food
  or servants. The Hydrozoans have been actively pursuing plans of dominating the
  entire ocean environment for sometime now. They have found this to be more difficult
  than they first expected because of efforts by others to accomplish this same goal.
  They are now pursuing plans to eliminate said competition. They have a number of
  attacks they are capable of using on others (in fact, they can even wield weapons
  which are not too heavy - but this is rare), but their most feared ability is their
  poisonous skin which turns victims to stone (exactly as per Ert in the rulebook
  - but will cause damage even if the victim doesn't turn to stone).
