description: The carnivorous ape is a larger, stronger and very aggressive mutant
  relative of the gorilla. This beast has fair intelligence and is extremely cunning.
  It hungers particularly for human flesh (Grens are also a favorite item on their
  menu). The eyesight of the ape is keen, as is it's hearing and sense of smell (any
  attempts to surprise or sneak up on the beast suffer a -2 die roll). It can also
  swing limb-from-limb in the trees at a speed of 18.

combat: Blights or 'cloud worms' prefer to attack their victims invisibly. Their first
  action on becoming visible is to create a powerful photogenerative flash of light
  to blind and stun its prey. It then attacks by biting or constriction, grabbing
  its prey in a powerful hold. It prefers to attack single creatures or small groups,
  but it will always attack when it feels its territory is threatened.
