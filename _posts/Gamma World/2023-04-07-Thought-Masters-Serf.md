reactions: ''
behavior: Serfs have claws instead of fingernails and can make two cal attacks per
  turn that inflict Intensity 8 Poison.  Serfs prefer mental combat tophysical combat
  (90% chance to attack with a mental attack).  They carry Tech Level I gear or higher
  if they have access.  A large Serf clan will organize into a gridage of 10d10+50
  troops led by a general who holds power with superior strength and cunning.

new_description: These humanoids have claws instead of fingers on their hands and
  with them can make two attacks per round.  The claws carry intensity 8 debilitative
  poison. Serfs have a partial carapace, a ridgid, horny plate that covers the top
  and back of their heads.
combat: Serfs may make two claw attacks per or other type of attack.  They much prefer
  to engage in mental combat as opposed to physical melee, and are 90% likely to do
  so.  Serfs commonly wear chain mail into battle and will fight with Tech III weapons,
  such as flintlock rifles.  They prefer the battle axe to sword in melee combat .
society: Serf, are either encountered as a small patrol, or may be found in large
  "brigades" of 5d20+50 individuals.  (a bridage will include 30% females and 30%
  children.) Serfs are militant, and prefer to dress in uniforms imitating ancient
  military and police designs, using these as clan symbols.  They are lifely to attack
  other brigades of serfs as they are other enemies.  Although they are a Tech Level
  II society, they readily use higher Tech Level equipment if shown how to operate
  it.  They are semi-nomadic, traveling when food in a partiiclar area becomes scarce,
  or whth the changing of seasons.  Once every few years, at the whim of the commander,
  a brigade travels to Gran Rads.  Once there it partipates in a festival of celebration
  with other serf bridages, holding fladitorial contests and swapping stories.  One
  serf clan, the Ministers of Thought, never leaves Gra Rad.  Its memvers believe
  that a serf leader called the Forstar will be born to their caln there, and will
  lead the serfs to create a great new Nation.
