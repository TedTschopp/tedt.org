description: The Podogs are huge mutated mastiffs that can be ridden by man-sized
  creatures.  Podog packs consist of a mated pair and half the pups from the previous
  litter.  Podogs will have a litter of 1d6 pups per year for 1d10 years.

behavior: In the wild, Podogs hun humans as prey in packs.  They are immune to all
  poison.  When excited by combat or the hunt, the podogs will bay in such a way as
  to exactly mimic sounds made by their prey.  There is a 1% chance that a given Podog
  will be a prized breed with dual brain, telepathy, and an extra mental mutation.  If
  someone were to breed two prized Podogs, this chance raises to 10% for each of their
  offspring.

new_description: A podog is a huge, mutated mastiff standing more than a meter and
  a half high at the shoulder. Podog coloring is usually a deep bay, but some run
  towards a chocolate or black coat.  One in one hundred podogs is a prize breed,
  with the dual brain mutation and its attendant additional one to three mental mutations.
  These animals, when encountered, are always the leaders of their packs. Podogs are
  sometimes found as mounts, but in their wild state they often hunt humanoids.
combat: Podogs attack with a powerful bite, but begin combat with a rush, charging
  and leaping for the throat of their victim.  This first rush allows them to make
  a full move and then atttack with a + 2 THAC. A successful hit of 4 or more above
  the required number means a small- or medium-sized victim has been knocked flat
  and is now fighting prone. Podogs also have the unusual habit of baying as they
  attack, exactly imitating the cries or sounds their opponents may be making. Note
  that the character who tries to use sonic blast or uses a screamer on a pack of
  rushing podogs will have as many as a dozen hounds return ing the sonic attack at
  full cffrLL. When fighting podogs still imitate sound, but they cannot use their
  bounding rush to enter melee.
society: Podogs are very intelligent creatures and have a rich oral pack tradition.
  They are not tool users, but they certainly understand some basic implements like
  bows and arrows or simple machines. If they are encountered as mounts, it is because
  they feels friendship for the person riding them-a podog will never allow itself
  to be saddled and ridden by a stranger' In thr wild, podogs are clever and dangerous
  hunters, using thrir sound imitation to maximum effect and making fast, hit-andrun
  attacks to weaken strong prey.
