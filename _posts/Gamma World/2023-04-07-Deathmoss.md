description: Deathmoss is a lush, soft-looking, moss-like plant which appears to be
  no different from other growths of similar plants. Creatures seem to be naturally
  attracted to its springy surface and comfortable bed. This is unfortunate for them
  but assures the deathmoss of food and propagation.This plant has developed an aromatic
  sap which is released when its stems and leaves are bruised by weight.The power
  of the sap is equal to intensity 12 poison, and any creature which succumbs to it
  falls into a comatose sleep. (Dice of damage results indicate only a proportionate
  lowering of resistance to the aromatic power next melee round if the victim remains
  within one meter of the bruised plants, or directly above them.) The deathmoss has
  developed boring root tendrils, which penetrate the flesh of comatose creatures
  and inject dissolving juices which bring a nutrient sludge to the roots in a short
  time. Thus fed, the deathmoss both grows up to one-square meter per feeding and
  develops berries to attract new prey. This purple-veined gray fruit, when eaten,
  increases all five senses [sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste) for one hour,
  but thereafter causes a 50% loss of normal senses for another hour.
