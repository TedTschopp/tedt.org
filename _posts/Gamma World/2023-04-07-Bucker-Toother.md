description: These mutant descendents of the beaver and otter have oily gray or dark
  brown skin. The creatures stand 1 meter tall at the shoulders and are considerably
  larger than their ancestors. They have longer front legs than rear ones, and their
  bodies are broader in front, thinner in the rear (bulldog-shaped). Toothers have
  beaver-like heads with small closely set eyes (Vision Defect  Tunnelvision) and
  large traplike jaws. These creatures have developed extremely large sabre-toothed
  front teeth (Oversized Body Parts) measuring 30cm in length and causing 2d6+10 points
  of damage. This fearsome attack is coupled with woodcutting abilities.These mutants
  live most of their lives in freshwater wetlands building dams and complex living
  quarters. The tunnels in their dams are built only wide enough for their bodies
  to move through. This is done to prevent attacks from the larger enemies in their
  area. Toothers hate technology and the devices of the Ancients, responding amicably
  only to those creatures that possess and display natural abilities and live within
  nature.These mutants pride themselves on being able to withstand pain (Mental Control
  of Physical Body) and use the powers of other creatures against themselves (Thought
  Imitation). Every Toother must remain close to the water throughout its lifetime,
  because without water (Water Dependency) the oils in its skin would dry up and the
  mutant would eventually die. Because of its Vision Defect and the need to remain
  close to water, the Toother is a vulnerable target for predators, but its Teleportation
  ability allows freedom of movement without the potential dangers of moving through
  wild lands. Toothers memorize the dam complexes of other Toothers and when they
  need to travel from one complex to another they simply teleport themselves. Toothers
  will generally avoid contact with other beings unless those beings demonstrate friendliness
  and great natural abilities.
