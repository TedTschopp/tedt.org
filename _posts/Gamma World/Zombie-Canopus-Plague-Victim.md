description: The figure appears humanoid and is clothed in a plain jumpsuit.  It seems
  to have no other possessions.  Its body quivers and shakes in a very inhuman way.
  It appears to be made of a dark brown, glistening, gelatinous substance. The disgusting
  creature will attack the party by bashing characters with its two misshapen fists.

behavior: It is a plague zombie, a victim of the horrible Canopus plague. Each attack
  does only 1d2 points of damage, but anyone struck will be coated with some of the
  creature's gooey substance.  The brown material will eat away at the victim's flesh,
  causing 1d6 points of damage per round. If the damage taken exceeds the victim's
  total number of hit points, the victim will become a plague zombie and attack the
  rest of the party. The only way to stop the plague from taking over a body is to
  remove the affected flesh with a sharp object, causing 1d4 points of damage per
  affected area. Once the plague has taken over a body, there is no cure. The Canopus
  plague is an alien disease brought back to Earth by long-range scout ships in the
  early 2300's. It is highly contagious and causes its victims' flesh to change into
  a viscous, pudding-like material. Once the plague has totally taken over a body,
  the victim becomes a zombie, interested only in seeking out healthy humans and infecting
  them with the foul disease. The Canopus Plague never broke out in epidemic proportions
  on Earth, but many space stations such as this were completely contaminated. When
  this station was infected, the survivors were lucky enough to escape and leave the
  plague-zombies behind. The space station has remained functioning, but plague zombies
  wander the rooms and halls in an endless search for uninfected humans.
