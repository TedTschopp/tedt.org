behavior: When a starving worm senses movement of a large object above it, it will
  burst out of the ground to discover if the object is eatable. If it is the worm
  will bite or use its mass to crush the prey. There is a 15% chance it will leave
  the soil totally and use its stinger. Note that they are mentally weak and can be
  tricked or controlled easily.The only reason there are not more worms is that cannibalism
  is common and food (soil organic matter) is rare down deep. They fear water because
  they can not swim and will drown quickly if submerged.
