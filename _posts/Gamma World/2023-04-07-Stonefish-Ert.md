combat: Ert have a mutated gland the secretes a chemical that rapidly calcifies living
  tissue. In effect, a creature bitten by an ert turns to chalky, white stone. Treat
  the ert's poison as a paralytic agent, except that on a critical failure of the
  Constitution feat check the victim is permanently calcified. Otherwise the chemical
  has the same effect as a paralytic poison (which can still kill if a paralyzed victim
  falls into the water).
society: Ert are found in cold mountain streams and lakes, and their habitats can
  sometimes be picked out by the calcified bodies or one or more predators. Each summer
  the ert spawn and hundreds of them make their way upstream. They are particularly
  dangerous at this time and likely to attack other creatures that approach their
  spawning grounds.
