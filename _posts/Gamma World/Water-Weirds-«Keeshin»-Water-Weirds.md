description: Keeshin are albino mutant frogs, standing 1 meter tall with a humanoid
  posture and functional hands. Their skin is completely white, almost translucent,
  and coated with a thin layer of slime. Their eyes are wide-set and their mouth is
  filled with sharp teeth. They rarely wear clothing or adornment.

behavior: It is greedy and solitary.  Its lair is a partially-submerged stone caern
  that it lines with shiny objects of varying worth.  They can submerge for over an
  hour, but if they are out of the water for more than 24 hours they will die.

combat: Keeshin are intelligent creatures, but not friendly to other species. They
  covet ancient artifacts and anything else they consider valuable, and they're more
  than willing to kill or intimidate to get what they want. They've been known to
  set up "tolls" across rivers and lakes where they live. They dislike physical conflict,
  prefering to use their mutations in combat.
society: Fortunately for the world, Keeshin dislike each other and tend to be solitary.
  They mate briefly and the female lays eggs in the water that hatch into dozens of
  keeshin tadpoles, few of which survive to maturity. Mature keeshin telekinetically
  build stone dwellings under water, partially filled with air, to store their goods
  and hide from danger.
