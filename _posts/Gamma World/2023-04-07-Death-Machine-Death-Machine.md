habitat: Military Base, Former War Zone
base_stock: Robot
robot_classification: Military

  the destruction of men and materials of the enemy while defending the men and materials
  of its own and allied bases.  Secondarily to avoid harming innocent noncombatants.
description: This 15 meter long, 9 meter wide, 3 meter high killing machine is covered
  with knobby projections housing sensors and weapons. It floats on antigrav pods.  It
  can also move around on the ground on treads.  When activated, its gun ports rotate
  constantly cycling through all potential targets it can sense.
equipment: 2 x Blaster Cannons that do 25d6 damage at a 3000 meter range. 6 x Black
  Ray Guns with a 300-meter range. 4 x Trek Guns that do the same damage as Trek Bombs
  and have a range of 200 meters16 x Mark VII Blaster Batteries of 4 guns each. 10
  x Mark CII MasterBlasters 500m Range of 4 guns each.  8 x Laser Batteries of 4 guns
  each (10d6 & 750m, 20d6 &1500m, 15d6 & 3000m) 6 Mini-missile Launchers with 5d20
  missiles fired individually1 x Fusion Bomb Launcher with 5d10 Fusion Bombs with
  3000m Range 1 x Energy Damping Field fuses the circuits of Robots coming within
  50 meters of the Death Machine and does 20 points of damage to all Energy Screens
  except its own within that range. The Death Machine's own Energy Screen can take
  400 points of damage.
reactions: When encountered without an objective, dormant, or in storage, a military
  common ID card can be used to move a Death Machine from place to place or have it
  perform mental tasks.  Only a supervisor's card can give it a military objective.  maintenance
  ID cards work normally, assuming that they are from the same military base.  Programmer's
  cards cannot be used to make a Death Machine attack the base it is assigned to.  Only
  a security card can do that.  Death Machines ignore civil authority cards.
behavior: Death Machines are very rare and will only be found near CI's that they
  are assigned to defend and from which they take orders. They almost always attack
  those who can't show Stage V I.D.
repair_and_healing: A Death Machine can repair 5 point of Damage per turn until it
  suffers half damager then it can only repair 1 hitpoint of damage per minute.  When
  reduced to less than 50 hit points it can only repair 1 hitpoint a minute.  Some
  death machines may shutdown when reduced to 20 hit points so that they may repair
  themselves and attack later.
