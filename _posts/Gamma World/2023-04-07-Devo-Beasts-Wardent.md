new_description: These 1-meter-tall humanoids are covered in silky blond to dark brown
  fur.  They have three toes on their feet, as well as four fingers on each human-like
  hand, and tend to be chubby.  Their faces are quite furry, but have a wizened expression
  on them.  When seen, they usually are wearing clothing and accessories of Tech Level
  II and III.
combat: Not having a great physical preseme, the wardents, opt to combat threats mentally,
  which provides them with a chance to escape, if necessary. They are not naturally
  aggressive and will avoid violence, if possible. They are quite cunning, and will
  usually keep potential enemies at bay with a variety of mental tricks.  Occasionally,
  a Wardent will carry an artifact weapon of some sort, but will avoid using it except
  in dire need.
society: Wardents tend to be solitary by nature, usually traveling alone, or with
  a single companion. They dwell in deep and inaccessible mountain and forest regions,
  and their homes tend to be complex mazes of winding passages made of mud walls or
  intertwined in the branches of very tall and large trees They have a natural curiosity
  for knowledge and odd experiences, as well as an insatiable hunger for tasty food
  . These traits can convince a Wardent to join in on an adventure. provided anu group
  it comes in contact with does not seem menacing to it. Although wardents are natively
  a Tech Level I culture, they have no fear of stranger artifacts and will readily
  use them. It is not uncommon to see wardents with steel knives, flintlocks or even
  artifacts that they have found or acquired that they have found or acquired through
  trade.  Their insatiable curiosity means that any usable artifacts which fall into
  their hands will soon yield up their secrets or be broken.
