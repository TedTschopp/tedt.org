description: Win Seen are ground covering creepers that can spread to cover a large
  area (as much as 20 meters in diameter)  The blue-green land variety covers shady
  areas of ground and grows in groups which are so entangled that is difficult to
  tell where one plant beigns and another leaves off.  The yellow-green aquatic variety
  floats freely on the surface of shallow water, ponds, marshes, and rivers.

behavior: The Yellow Win Seen gives off an order that encourages carnivorous fish
  to live nearby and has primative magnetic control.  The new growth vines on a plant
  may be picked, chopped, and boiled into doses of Intensity 14 poison antidote.

combat: 'Win seen are not intelligent, but they have their own defense mechanisms
  to protect them from predators. Water win seen emit a sonic blast when touched by
  another creature. Land win seen are covered with a contact irritant. Characters
  touching it must make a Constitution feat check: Critical Failure results in a +3
  penalty on all actions for 2 rounds; Failure, +2 penalty for 2 rounds; Ordinary,
  +1 penalty for 2 rounds; Good or Amazing, no effect. Land win seen also exhibit
  a crude form of magnetic control, forcing all ferrous objects near them to the ground.'
society: Win seen are largely harmless when left alone. They're edible and quite nutritious.
  A single win seen can be chopped up and cooked down to yield a thick paste that
  serves as a poison antidote. A dose of it swallowed or applied to a poisoned wound
  provides a -2 step bonus on the Constitution feat check. A single plant yields ten
  doses of the antidote.
