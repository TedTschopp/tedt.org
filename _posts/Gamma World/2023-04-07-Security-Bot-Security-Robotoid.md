  and during normal business hours.  During an emergency or after hours, only a supervisor's
  card can command it.  It is required to obey any emergency civil authority card
  , so long as it does not violate mission statement.The owning corporateion has both

  robots reat security cards in the sam maner as civil Authority Cards.

  rarely miss any telltale signs of intruders.  Upon spotting an unauthorized activity,
  this robot always gives warning before attacking.  Even then , it only uses the
  minimal force necessary to prefent the crime.  It immediately radios the police
  and other security robots upon spotting a problem.  Animals are kept out of buildings,
  but otherwize ignored.  Plants are ignored altogether.
