description: The herkel is a small (half-meter long) fish similar to the piranha,
  but found in temperate and tropical climates throughout Gamma Terra. It has a relatively
  flat body and a large mouth full of sharp, tearing teeth.  They hunt in schools
  and devour anything edible in the water with them.  They are only 1/2 a meter in
  length, their bite is quite dangerous since over a third of their length is taken
  up by teeth and mouth.

reactions: ''
behavior: Herkels secrete a contact Poison I18 that make them dangerous to touch.  If
  a large amount of blood is present in the water, there is a 30% chance that the
  group will break into a feeding frenzy.  They will attack the closest living creature,
  including other Herkels, and they pass all Morale checks.

combat: Herkel are nearly always encountered in small schools of 4-16 (4d4). They
  viciously attack anything that comes within their reach in the water, particularly
  larger mammals. Their scales are coated with a thin layer of waterproof neurotoxin
  that affects any creature that touches them. The scent of blood in the water drives
  herkel into a feeding frenzy, and they'll even attack each other in such cases.
society: Herkel are found in freshwater rivers and lakes throughout Gamma Terra. They
  migrate frequently so as not to deplete their food sources.
