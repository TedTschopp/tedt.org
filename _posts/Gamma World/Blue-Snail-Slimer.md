behavior: When very hungry, slimers will attack live prey. When doing so the use a
  bite and attempt to slime it. This attack is at - 2 and no bite is possible in that
  round.  The slime burns until washed off with water or alcohol.  Slimers are dangerous
  pests in inhabited regions, but do perform an important duty of eating dead plant
  and animal matter (carrion). They are preyed upon by animals immune to acid.
