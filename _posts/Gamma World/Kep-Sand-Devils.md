Description: The kep is a plant consisting of a deeply buried root cluster and a network
  of strong, tough root-like tendrils that grow just below the surface of sandy soil.
  A mature kep can cover an area up to 30 meters in diameter.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: Its roots will snap out of the ground and entangle and constrict prey who
  walk over the plant.  The plant will continue to constrict around the prey until
  it is immobile and then it will grow its roots into the prey and start to digest
  it.  Once all the creatures hit points are consumed, the plant will release a mobile
  seed that will burrow through the ground to 60 meters away, where it will then start
  to send out its own roots.  If the plant fails any sort of morale check, it will
  pull its roots into itself and retreat deep underground.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Keps are sensitive to vibration, feeling when any creature massing more than
  a kilogram moves across the surface above them. It bursts from the soil with its
  tendrils, entraping the creature and crushing it to death. When the prey's struggles
  cease, the tendrils drag it into the earth where the kep's root cluster and begin
  breaking it down into fertilizer for the plant. A kep is capable of attacking one
  creature for every five meters radius it occupies (thus a fully mature kep can attack
  up to six creatures at once, provided they're all standing above it).
Society: Kep plants do not tolerate any other plants growing above them, so the areas
  where they grow tend to be barren soil, sometimes clearings amdist other vegetation.
  A mature kep produces a single mobile seed once per season, which burrows out of
  the ground scurries off in search of a place to root.
