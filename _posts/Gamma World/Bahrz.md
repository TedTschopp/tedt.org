description: There is always a 40% chance there are 1d4 additional bears in the immediate
  vicinity of a Bahrz as the Bahrz has taken upon itself the task of serving as a
  protector for the normal bear population. When encountering any bears in the Rocky
  Mountains, there is also a 10% chance one or more Bahrz are present as well. Bahrz
  sometimes will go into population centers to trade information for goods and services.
  Bahrz are especially aggressive with hunters and trappers.
equipment: ''
reactions: ''
behavior: These Intelligent black bears are fearsome opponents if provoked with the
  ability to camouflage itself and blend into the surrounding terrain, and with the
  ability to regenerate up to 30 hit points a day. The Bahrz have a protective armored
  shell around their ribcage and upper back as well. In Combat the Bahrz preferred
  attack method is to generate a light flash, then select one target that still has
  vision for mental control. If threatened with death the Bahrz will automatically
  teleport to their den. If surprised, they can still attack as a traditional bear
  doing 1d4, 1d4, 1d6 of damage (Claw, Claw, Bite) plus a 3d6 crush hug if both foreclaws
  hit.
