description: These giant, mutated bees are only found near gigantic, non-carnivorous
  flowers (they can generally tell dangerous flowers from safe ones). Dimly intelligent
  and not unfriendly toward humans and humanoids, they speak human languages in a
  low, mum- bling drone. They are generally peaceable, but rarely (10% of random encounters,
  or for a specific reason determined by GM) one may become upset for no apparent
  reason and angrily buzz around or even sting (25% chance if enraged) harmless passers-by.
  Of course, bumbles also attack creatures that attack them or try to rob their underground
  nests. They can be recruited or hired with offers of food.Some are occasionally
  trained as mounts, but their displacement and energy nega- tion mutations discourage
  this practice.
