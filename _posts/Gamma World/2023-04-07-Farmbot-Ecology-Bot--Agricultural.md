description: These 3 x 6 x 1 meter ovoids have 1d4+2 tentacles, each 6 meters long
  and tipped with touch sensors and 3 pronged manipulative claws. There is a 50% chance
  that each tentacle will have an electronic stun device (works by touch with the
  same effect as a Stun Grenade) in the end as well. Special devices that retract
  into the Robot's body include a soil analysis lab, plow, disc, rake, mower, flame
  gun, vibro saw and nozzles with a 9 meter range containing water, herbicides, fungicides,
  fertilizers and insecticides. None of these devices can be used as weapons. If the
  player wants a Robot reprogrammed to use them in this role, the GM must decide what
  damage they do and how effective they are.
equipment: ''
reactions: A common ID card allows the operator to command the robot to perform any
  menial farm / landscaping chore or to temporarily stop whatever it is doing.  A
  supervisor's card can reprioritize the chorse or command the bo to perform nonfarm-related
  or non-park related tasks, so long as it doesn't leave the farm or park property.Only
  a civil authority card or a program override card can get the robot to leave its
  territory
behavior: These Robots are common in rural areas.
