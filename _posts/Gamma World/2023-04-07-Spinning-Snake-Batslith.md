description: A batslith is a beautifully colored snake noted among scholars for its
  unusal transportation and attack-- Spinning.  A batslith can raise its one-meter
  length up to full length vertically and begin spinning, pivioting on its tail.  After
  one action of this the snake spins so fast to seem like a miniature, multi-colored
  tornado.  Live batsliths are worth quite a bit to certain collectors.
equipment: A batslith keeps no equiptment.
