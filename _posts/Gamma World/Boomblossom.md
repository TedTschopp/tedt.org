description: These intelligent, mutated descendants of the Swamp Rose retain their
  blossoms (a dark rose- pink color) longer than their ancestors, keeping them from
  mid-spring until almost autumn. Other than that, they look like humanoid shaped
  plants.Boomblossoms will make use of any artifacts they have at hand in combat.
  They are by no means stupid, however, and understand there are times when it's better
  to not use technology. Whether or not they use artifacts, they often will use their
  beguiling power before entering combat.They communicate with each other (and other
  creatures) telepathically, and co-ordinate their actions so as to not get in each
  other's way. If, for some reason, they do not use artifacts, they are quite capable
  of handling themselves in combat, having thorns and contact poison sap in melee,
  and explosive seeds (which is how they got the name `boomblossoms') for ranged combat.Boomblossom
  seeds sprout in the spring and are nonsentient and immobile for their first year
  of life. In the spring of their second year, they become mobile and quickly learn
  the value of teamwork and of the power of Ancient artifacts, which they readily
  use. They will often trade artifacts for items they consider more useful to them.
  When a boomblossom group becomes too large for the land to support them, a group
  will break away from the main group to form a new community.
