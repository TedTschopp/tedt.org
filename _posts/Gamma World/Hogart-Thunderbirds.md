  snake has changed beyond recognition since the Social Wars, and it now lairs in
  mountainous regions and near the north and south polar areas. Being clumsy and slow
  on land, the hogart prefers to stay aloft and avoids contact with almost all other
  creatures.The hogart is capable of creating sonic booms from snapping its wings.
  Sonic boom generation is a conscious physical mutation, useable three times per
  day, and it will affect all those within a 20-m radius in front of the hogart. The
  sonic boom blast causes 6d6 points damage, and all those who fail a constitution
  check (CON x 5) will become deaf for 24 hours. A hogart will only attack out of
  hunger or if attacked first.The hogart has learned to use its heightened vision
  to scan intelligent parties carefully from high altitudes, thus avoiding the more
  dangerous oppo- nents. If necessary, a hogart will delay attacking an enemy until
  the opponent is engaged in combat with another crea- ture or until the opponent
  is asleep. The hogart will then drop out of the sky like a rock, coming to a sudden
  halt directly over the victim as it snaps its wings and generates the sonic boom.
  It can then hover and continue to generate thesonic boom every action turn thereafter.
  Hogarts can sometimes (if carefully approached) serve as guides, for theyknown the
  territory around their snowy lairs very well. Hogarts do not like yexils for some
  reason, and often attempt to blast them out of the sky.Hogarts have snow-white scaly
  skin and feathered wings, with a coarse blue mane running from the backs of their
  heads to their tails. Their wing feathers are highly prized for decorative pur-
  poses, and four sacks full of feathers (as much as can be taken from a hogart) would
  be worth about 150 gold pieces.
