description: A blight is a large, worm-like creature 3 meters in length with tough,
  leathery skin and bat-like wings with a 10-meter wingspan. It has small eyes and
  a mouth full of sharp, tearing teeth. Blights tend to have dark, mottled hides,
  when they can be seen at all.

behavior: Blights have the ability to bend light, causing them to be invisible whenever
  they concentrate.  When a blight attacks it becomes visible, gaining an automatic
  surprise.  Blights will use this mutation while they are fleeing.  Blights are completely
  resistant to weapons involving radiation, heat, or sonic effects.  Their preferred
  method of attack is to wrap themselves around a victim constricting and biting.

combat: Blights or "cloud worms" prefer to attack their victims invisibly. Their first
  action on becoming visible is to create a powerful photogenerative flash of light
  to blind and stun its prey. It then attacks by biting or constriction, grabbing
  its prey in a powerful hold. It prefers to attack single creatures or small groups,
  but it will always attack when it feels its territory is threatened.
society: Blights nest in high, rocky areas and sometimes in tall trees where they
  can swoop down on prey. They're usually solitary, but sometimes found in mated pairs.
  They lay clutches of eggs that hatch into young blights. The young eat their unhatched
  siblings before flying off on their own.
