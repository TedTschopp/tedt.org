behavior: The pair hunts for food for the next generation. They swoop down (and are
  easy to see) on and attempt to paralyse potential food. When the prey is paralysed,
  the female inject it with 100- 1000 eggs. The eggs release a paralytic compound
  to keep the food from moving until they hatch. If the eggs are elim- inated (inventive
  GMs will thing of how), the affected PC/animal/NPC can be restored to normal. Hellflies
  live only for 2 weeks and do not feed.
