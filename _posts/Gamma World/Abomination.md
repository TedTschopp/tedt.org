description: The abomination is part plant and part lizard.  Its origin is lost in
  the mists of time, but it is known that no other creature like it exists on the
  continent.  The scaled / bark body has no defined shape to it, 3 foot long claws
  tipped limbs stick out at seemingly random places.  Its head is flat bony protrusion
  with a mass of short thick tentacle / branches surrounding it like a collar.  Its
  mouth is toothless, merely an entrance to the acid filled belly.

reactions: ''
behavior: While using life leech, any of its temporal fugue copies are not affected.  They
  are affected by anybody else's life leech as individual creatures.  This is not
  the same as the anti-life leech mutation.When in combat, the abomination needs four
  limbs to remain mobile, the others will leave and attack on their own.
