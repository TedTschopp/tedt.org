Description: This serpent is a mutated eel. Other than it size, it appears no different.It
  hunts by sonar. If attacking another creature, the serpent uses its eyes to slow
  the prey, then its bite and tail whip to slay the prey. When attacking ships, the
  green slows the ship, then uses magnetic control and TK to unarm the crew. Next
  it activates kinetic absorption, roars at the ship nand constricts it. The ship
  must be made of wodd and be between 4 and 8 meters in lenght for constriction to
  be successful. After the ship sinks, the serpent bites the whole crew to death before
  feeding. If it fails a moral check, the serpent generates fear and flees.They breed
  in the late summer at depths of 40-60 feet. They rarely come to the serface and
  will attack ships only if starving.
