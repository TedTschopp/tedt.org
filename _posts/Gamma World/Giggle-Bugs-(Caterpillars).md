description: 'Giggle bugs spend most of their lives as caterpillars (the statistics
  in parentheses above refer to the adult moths, which do not have the beguiling mutation).
  Unlike most caterpillars with protective coloration, giggle bugs are quite prominent
  and distinctive: spotted, striped, and checkered in green, yellow, pink, red, blue,
  and white, with a clownlike false face on each end and mobile projections that resemble
  pin- wheels and party noisemakers. The effect is magnified by its mutational powers
  to become highly comical  so much so that most intelligent creatures that see a
  giggle bug must make a successful check vs. their MS x 2 or collapse in helpless
  laughter. A new MS check is rolled every 6 action turns after a failed one; if a
  crea- ture makes a subsequent roll, then it may stop laughing and crawl away. However,
  if a creature having made a successful MS check continues to look at the caterpillar,
  however, or even thinks about it clearly enough to make an attack, another MS check
  is required every action turn.If a creature laughs without rest for more minutes
  than it has points of CN, then exhaustion sets in, incapacitating the creature for
  3 search turns. During this time, the creature may make no attacks, and must move
  at half speed. Creatures (including PCs) with IN less than 4 or greater than 16
  are not affected by the giggle bugs comical appearance. Blind creatures and machines
  with purely artificial intelligence (like androids and robots) are also immune,
  but cyborgs, with their human brains, are not.Giggle bugs are immune to all kinds
  of poison, and they habitually feed on poisonous plants; consequently, their bodies
  are also poisonous (roll 3d6 for poison intensity for any giggle bug that a character
  tries to bite or eat). Giggle bugs remain in cater- pillar form from March through
  November. They pupate in the winter and emerge the following March as huge, gaudy
  moths that live only long enough to mate and lay eggs. The eggs take a full year
  to hatch. Eggs, pupae, and adult moths are all harlequin-colored; they cannot excite
  laughter as the caterpillars do, but they are equally poisonous.'
