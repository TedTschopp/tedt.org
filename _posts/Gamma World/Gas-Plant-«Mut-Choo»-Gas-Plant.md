description: Mut choo are 3 to 4m diameter plants that produce their own gas, inflate,
  and float through the air. They float about 7m above the ground but have many mutations
  that allow them to satisfy their carnivorous appetites. Each mut choo is covered
  with throwing thorns, has manipulative vines hanging from it that are tipped with
  barbed leaves, and have hundreds of tiny tendrils hanging from the bottom that act
  as boring tendrils when the plant floats down on an unconscious victim.      The
  mut choo will deflate itself after eating excessively, and look like a large patch
  of vine-like vegetation on the ground. When it wishes to hunt, it increases its
  metabolic rate and inflates itself, then floats away.

behavior: This gas is especially susceptible to fire, flaming weapons, heat, lasers,
  pyrokinesis, etc. If more than 10 points of this kind of damage are sustained in
  a single turn, the mut choo explodes, causing 1d10 points of damage to all within
  7m.       Mut choo prefer to live in areas like jungles, forests, swamp lands, and
  other locales with overhanging vegetation. They are sometimes found in caves or
  ancient ruins.
