behavior: This creature spins sticky webs in areas of sea currents to catch food.
  It is non- venomous. It typically hides in its lair (like a cave or rock outcropping)
  until its prey exhausts itself in the web. Then it goes and picks the victim to
  pieces with its claws while the victim is still stuck fast. The sea spider is immune
  to the stickiness of the web due to body excretions.
