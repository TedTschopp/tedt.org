Description: The Shreelon were first mentioned in `Rite of Passage'. Many of their
  minions were encountered in that adventure, but the Shreelon themselves never made
  an appearance. They are from beyond our galaxy. They are humanoid in appearance
  except for a slightly bloated head having a number of tentacles where their mouth
  should be  looking a bit like some Lovecraftian horror. They have two large milky
  white eyes with no pupils giving the impression of soulless evil. Their skin is
  the darkest black, almost seeming to absorb light. It is clammy/slimy to the touch.
  They consider mankind cattle and slaves. They eat the brains (and occasionally flesh)
  of those they consider lower life forms. Though incredibly intelligent, they are
  a thoroughly vile and evil race. They seem to dislike bright light. Their technology
  is based on crystal (and occasionally organic) devices (Tech V). They use a hieroglyphic
  written language and no spoken language. They communicate entirely by telepathy.
  To a player character, Shreelon `speech' sounds like a loud echoing whisper inside
  their head. The Shreelon work by `proxy' whenever they can, finding it advantageous
  to work through others or use acquired resources to accomplish most tasks rather
  than direct investment. However, when they are encountered in the flesh, they are
  terrifying adversaries. Following this principle, there is some evidence to suggest
  that the Shreelon had a hand in the founding of the Friends of Entropy cryptic alliance.  This
  enables them to further divide and weaken Earth's sentient races without direct
  risk to themselves. Even before their attack on Earth, it appears that the aliens
  were working behind the scenes, influencing events which would set the stage for
  the apocalypse (inciting nation against nation). Their Mental Control ability is
  slightly different than listed in the rulebook. They are able to dominate a subject
  without actually leaving their own body  if the victim dies, regardless of range,
  the controller is uninjured. If control is broken the victim will not remember being
  controlled.
