description: Ger'tal are mutant water striders. They have a slender, dark body, and
  the ability to 'walk' on water. This is accomplished by large water resistant hairs
  on each foot. To move It extends one claw into the water (otherwise it would just
  sit there unable to move). They are important carrion eaters.

behavior: The Sheezu can completely bury themselves in 3 turns.     If a sheezu feels
  threatened and bites, it immediately salivates its acidic digestive juices into
  the wound, causing an additional 1d4 points of damage. This always happens on the
  first bite, but thereafter occurs on alternating turns. The sheezu can keep biting
  every turn, but can secrete acid only every other turn. They can use four of their
  eight claws during any turn unless a character or creature makes the mistake of
  picking them up or turning them on their back, whereupon they can use all eight
  claws and their bite. Sheezu make wonderful pets and will never use their claws
  or bite and acid unless they feel extremely threatened. A qualified animal trainer
  can teach a sheezu a maximum of three commands or tricks".
