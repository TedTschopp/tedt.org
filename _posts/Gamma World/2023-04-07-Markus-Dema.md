society: A verbat usually stakes out an area and keeps it clear of roaming monster
  or annoyances (rats, snakes, etc...) It usually stakes out passages or trails that
  are frequently used by many races and expects to be paid for its efforts.  To a
  Verbat, keeping an area safe is its job.  An adventurer usually encounters a Verbat
  rounding a corner or passing through a doorway into the Verbat's area.  Upon seeing
  the adventurer, the verbat will immediately announce a telepatic requiest, 'Toll,
  Please!'  Toll-taking is standard with Verbat and can take the form of payments
  of loot, work in exchange for passage (like hauling the carcass of a dead opponent
  out of the area), or fighting for the Verbat (in the case of extremely tough advesaros
  it cannot fight alone).  Paymenst always must be made both upon entering or leaving
  a Verbat's area.  The exact toll is determined by the GM and depends on how much
  trouble it is for the Verbat to keep the area clear and how wealty the party appears
  to be.  Once a party becomes friendly with a Verbat (passing though his area and
  paying toll more than 4 times), imformation may be gained, by payment or otherwise,
  from the Verbat.  This information always concerns the area the Verbat patrolls.
