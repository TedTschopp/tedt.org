description: The flipp's true physical form has not changed at all from its ancestral
  dolphin shape. Like its ancestor, it attacks by ramming victims in the water at
  high speed with its snout.Though these intelligent mammals have no technology, they
  possess their own culture and society. They have been known to save Pure Strain
  Humans and humanoids from drowning, though they are indifferent to the plight of
  mutated animals. Flipps have never joined the Zoopremisists alliance.Flipps have
  been known to use their Actual Metamorphosis mutation to join parties of land dwelling
  adventurers that they have befriended. Of course, they must somehow acquire weapons
  and clothing on their own. If turned into their true form (as per the Actual Metamorphosis
  mutation), they will take 4 points of damage per round while they are out of water,
  until they are able to assume a new form or reach a water supply to keep their skins
  from drying out.Only 2% of flipps encountered will have the Time Manipulation mutation.
  For many years, flipps have been trying to improve their time related abilities
  through selective breeding so that flipps with Time Manipulation can attempt a series
  of time jumps to reach a period before the Social Wars. There they try to warn humans
  in an attempt to alter history, but apparently they are not being taken seriously
  since the future Gamma World still exists. Still, all the flipps with Time Manipulation
  will eventually try to go back and warn of the danger to come.
