description: Letharp are huge, bottom-feeding fish which range in size from four to
  seven meters in length. Letharp have silvery-white underbellies and solid or mottled
  backs which range from blue-brown to yellow to brilliant orange. Mottling is usually
  white, groy. ar yellow. Coloration is seldom unchanging for very-long, since letharp
  have chameleon powers. Their heads are cov- ered with a bony plate around which
  are many enlarged and thickened scales. Projecting upwards and forewards from this
  plate is a horn-like bone growth whose length varies (accor-ding to the size of
  the lethorp) from one meter to nearly two meters.Normally sluggish and peaceful,
  sudden movements or passing shadows throw a letharp into a state of alarmed frenzy
  which results in the creature swimming in a blind rush (double normal movement far
  up to 100 meters) towords the possible threat, either to frighten the intruder away
  or to kill by ramming with its horn. Because of this unpredictable behavior boats
  are often smashed or holed by frightened letharp.Knowledgeable mariners are reported
  to paint the bottoms of their vessels a bright yellow-orange, far this color tends
  to repel or possibly reassure the would- be attacker.
