> # The Basilisk Egg
> In 1474, on the Thursday before Laurentii[^1], a rooster and an egg it had laid were burned on Kohliberg[^2] in Basel, where the free people lived and the free boys held court. This happened as a result of a judicial decision by the free boys[^3] and in the presence of a large crowd from the city and the countryside. The event caused considerable alarm because it was widely believed that such a rooster's egg, if laid by a seven-year-old rooster and incubated in manure by a snake known as Coluber[^4]—some also say mere sunlight suffices—would give birth to a Basilisk. This creature, half rooster and half snake, though no larger than a few spans in length, is more terrifying than the largest dragon, as its mere gaze is deadly. Such fearsome powers, however, are effective only in sunlight. Hence, people who had such a creature in their cellar had to keep it closed all year long to prevent sunlight from entering. It is also said that any bush or grass the Basilisk passes over immediately withers. The most frightening attribute is its deadly poison; if someone on horseback pierces the Basilisk with a lance, the poison travels up the lance and instantly kills both horse and rider. The only way to kill a Basilisk is to show it its own reflection; upon seeing it, the creature falls dead instantly.

[^1]: St. Lawrence (or Laurentius in Latin) was a Christian martyr and one of the seven deacons of Rome who were responsible for giving help to the poor and the needy. He lived during the time of Emperor Valerian, around the 3rd century AD. During the persecution of Christians, Lawrence was ordered to bring the treasures of the Church to the Roman authorities. Instead, he presented the poor and the sick, declaring them to be the true treasures of the Church. For this act, he was reportedly martyred by being roasted alive on a gridiron. St. Lawrence is considered the patron saint of cooks, chefs, and comedians, among others, and his emblem is often the gridiron on which he was said to have been martyred. His feast day is observed on August 10th each year. This day is commonly referred to as the Feast of St. Lawrence. Given that the Swiss folktale you mentioned refers to the "Thursday before Laurentii," it would be the Thursday immediately preceding August 10th.

[^2]: A well-known geographical location in Basel, Switzerland. In the context of the story, it appears to be a place where "free people" lived and where "free boys held court." The story suggests that it's a place significant enough to serve as the venue for the dramatic events involving the burning of the rooster and its egg, which were suspected of leading to the birth of a basilisk. The name "Kohliberg" itself does not appear to be widely recognized as a specific mountain, hill, or area in Basel or its surrounding regions . It's possible that the name could be a fictional or historical locale used for the purpose of storytelling.

[^3]: The term "Freiknaben" (translated as "free boys") appears in the Swiss German folktale "Das Basilisken-Ei." In the context of the story, it suggests a group of young men or boys who hold some form of judicial or decision-making power. They are the ones who pass the judgment leading to the burning of the rooster and its egg due to the fear of a basilisk being born. The term "Freiknaben" is not a standard or widely recognized term in Swiss or German history, law, or folklore. Its specific meaning could be unique to this tale or may be a poetic or symbolic way to describe a group of individuals who held communal or judicial roles in the local society. Given its specialized context in the story, it would be reasonable to explain in your post that the "free boys" were a form of local authority or decision-making body within the community, even though the exact details of their role or functions may not be clearly defined.

[^4]: The term "Coluber" refers to a genus of snakes, generally known for being non-venomous, quick, and agile. In classical Latin and historical texts, the word "coluber" has been used more broadly to describe snakes. The genus Coluber includes species like the racer snakes in North America, which are known for their speed and agility.  In the context of "Das Basilisken-Ei," the term "Coluber" is mentioned as the type of snake that is believed to incubate the rooster's egg to give birth to a basilisk when the egg is laid by a seven-year-old rooster. The choice of the term may be based on older, more generalized use of the word to mean "snake," rather than referring to the specific genus of Coluber. The mention of a snake in the story likely draws on the creature's historical and symbolic associations with danger, transformation, and mystery, contributing to the tale's sense of foreboding and the miraculous.
