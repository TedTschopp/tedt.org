Slowly slip the sands of time  
Past my fingers, through my hands.  
Crashing waves and pounding surf  
Tonight&#8217;s the night we leave this earth

Companions brave our task complete.  
Some come to live, some come to sleep.  
But on my knees I come today   
Forgiveness asked and penance paid.

As we depart this earthly sphere  
I search myself for pride and fear:  
A sadness now, a twinge of guilt  
As glories fade and triumphs wilt.

Straight is our path into the west  
Straight is our journey and our quest  
The course is set, our way secure:  
Old burdens heavy, old hearts now pure.

Slowly slip the sands of time  
Past my fingers, through my hands.  
A whispering breeze, a swan in flight,  
A world awaking, an end to night.
