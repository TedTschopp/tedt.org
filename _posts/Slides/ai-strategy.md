subtitle: "Basic example with essential variables"
description: "A straightforward blog post generator demonstrating basic variable functionality."





quote: "Treat data like a grid asset; standardize on opinionated platforms; design our workforce for the AI era."
excerpt: "A pragmatic five-year strategy to move a century-old utility from paper-era workflows to AI‑centric operations: standardized platforms, an edge‑to‑cloud data fabric with preserved context, and a Mechanics & Drivers operating model anchored by measurable Time‑to‑Exit and edge‑to‑decision latency."

bullets:
  - "Data, not paper, must carry the work; make edge→decision latency a first‑class reliability metric."
  - "Consolidate to primary + secondary ecosystems; enforce Time‑to‑Exit (TTE) ≤ 18 months."
  - "Preserve context in an edge‑to‑cloud data fabric; standardize CI/CD, identity, and observability."
  - "Shift to a Mechanics (specialists) & Drivers (business) model, augmented by AI copilots."
  - "Govern via opinionated platform tenets, policy‑as‑code, and capability‑based contracts."

description: "White paper for utility leaders on consolidating platforms, building an edge‑to‑cloud data fabric with preserved context, and redesigning the workforce for AI—measured by edge→decision latency, TTE, reliability, compliance velocity, and customer outcomes."
