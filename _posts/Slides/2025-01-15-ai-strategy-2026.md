Wrapper post to surface slide deck in site.posts for legacy queries.
Direct include_relative with ../ traversal is disallowed on GitHub Pages (security); instead we lookup the collection doc by permalink.
If deck not found, a fallback notice appears (should not normally render).
{% endcomment %}
{% assign deck = site.slides | where: "permalink", "/slides/ai-strategy/" | first %}
{% if deck %}
  {{ deck.content }}
{% else %}
  <div class="notice--warning"><p>Slide content unavailable (collection lookup failed).</p></div>
{% endif %}
