## Introduction to the Patrol Method and Scouting Skills

---

**Objective**: Help Arrow of Light Cub Scouts understand and experience key elements of Scouts BSA, including the Patrol Method, Scout Oath and Law, Scout sign, salute, handshake, and developing their own patrol identity and code of conduct.

---

### 1. Demonstrate the Patrol Method: Choose a Patrol Name and Elect a Patrol Leader

Begin the meeting by explaining the Patrol Method. Break the Scouts into small groups of 6-8 (a "patrol"). Each patrol should come together and choose a Patrol name that reflects their shared interests or values. Encourage creativity! For example, they might select an animal like “Falcon Patrol” or a symbol like “Thunder Patrol.”

Next, the patrol members elect a Patrol Leader. Let them know this leader helps guide the patrol during activities, represents the patrol, and works with the adult leaders. The process of electing teaches leadership, cooperation, and decision-making.

**Benefits of the Patrol Method**:  
- Builds teamwork and cooperation.
- Promotes responsibility and leadership in every member.
- Gives each Scout a voice in how the group operates.
- Encourages Scouts to solve challenges as a team.

---

### 2. Get to Know Members of Your Patrol

Once the patrol has a name and leader, have each Scout introduce themselves. Ask them to share something about themselves, such as their favorite hobby, a personal goal, or what they are most excited about in scouting. This builds camaraderie and helps everyone feel included and important to the group.

---

### 3. Recite the Scout Oath and Scout Law with Your Patrol

Introduce the Scout Oath and Scout Law as the core values of Scouting. Go over the Oath and Law, explaining what each part means. Then, have the Scouts stand in a circle with their patrols, raise the Scout sign, and recite the Oath and Law together.

**Scout Oath**:  
*"On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight."*

**Scout Law**:  
*A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.*

---

### 4. With Your Patrol, Create a Code of Conduct

Explain to the Scouts that a Code of Conduct is a set of rules that everyone in the patrol agrees to follow. Ask each patrol to brainstorm together and come up with 3-5 guidelines that they think are important for their patrol. These should reflect Scouting values, such as respect, helping others, and being prepared. Write these down, and have each Scout agree to follow them.

---

### 5. Demonstrate the Scouts BSA Sign, Salute, and Handshake

Introduce the three key symbols used in Scouts BSA:

- **Scout Sign**: Hold up your right hand with the first three fingers raised, and the thumb holding down the little finger. The three fingers represent the three parts of the Scout Oath. Use the sign when reciting the Oath and Law or to get attention and signal silence.
  
- **Scout Salute**: Formed by making the Scout sign and bringing the hand up to the forehead, just above the right eyebrow. This is used when saluting the American flag during ceremonies.

- **Scout Handshake**: Use your left hand to shake another Scout’s left hand. This symbolizes trust and friendship.

Have the Scouts practice each one, explaining when and how to use them.

---

### 6. Learn the Scouts BSA Slogan and Motto

Teach the Scouts the BSA Slogan and Motto:

- **Slogan**: *"Do a Good Turn Daily."* This reminds Scouts to look for ways to help others, even in small ways, every day.
  
- **Motto**: *"Be Prepared."* This means being ready for anything—whether it’s knowing your skills, having the right tools, or being mentally and physically ready to meet challenges.

Discuss how these principles can apply in everyday life and how they can start using them now.

---

### Wrap-Up

Review what the Scouts have learned:  
- The importance of the Patrol Method and working as a team.  
- The meaning of the Scout Oath and Law.  
- How to use the Scout sign, salute, and handshake.  
- The Scouts BSA slogan and motto.  

Encourage them to live by these values and use the skills they've learned as they continue on their Scouting journey.

End with a group reflection or question time where Scouts can share what they enjoyed or ask any questions about what they learned.

## Arrow of Light Homework Assignment

---

#### **7. Visit a Scouts BSA Troop**

With your patrol, or with your parent or legal guardian, you are asked to visit a local Scouts BSA troop. This visit will help you experience what it's like to be in a Scouts BSA troop and give you a chance to see older Scouts in action. During the visit:

- Observe how the patrol method works in a real troop setting.
- Watch how the Scouts lead activities and manage their own meetings.
- Take note of how they use the Scout Oath, Scout Law, sign, salute, and handshake.
- If possible, ask questions about what it's like to transition from Cub Scouts to Scouts BSA.

Once you’ve completed your visit, be ready to share what you learned with your patrol at our next meeting.

---

#### **8. Complete the Child Abuse Prevention Activities**

At home, with your parent or legal guardian, please complete the activities in the booklet *“How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse: A Parent’s Guide.”* This guide is an important part of your Arrow of Light rank, and it teaches you how to stay safe and make smart choices.

Here’s what you need to do:

- Sit down with your parent or guardian and review the guide together.
- Complete all the activities and have an open discussion about each topic. This is a good time to ask any questions you might have and learn how to stay safe in different situations.
- Once you have gone through the entire booklet, ask your parent or guardian to sign off on your work.

Make sure you bring the completed and signed booklet to our next meeting for review.

---

#### Remember:
Both of these activities are key steps in earning your Arrow of Light rank and becoming ready to join a Scouts BSA troop. Completing them will help you grow in responsibility, safety awareness, and teamwork!
