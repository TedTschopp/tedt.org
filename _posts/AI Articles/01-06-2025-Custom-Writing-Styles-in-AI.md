_Bottom Line Up Front: You can train AI to write in your personal voice by feeding it samples of your past writing. This article walks you through how to capture your tone, structure, and storytelling style—then turn that into a reusable prompt. The result? AI that doesn’t just help you write—it writes like you._
 
Here is a superpower for you to enhance your use of AI. You can have AI write something in your own style of writing.  Click on the link and head on over to AI for Web and use this prompt.  Make changes 

```markdown
I'd like your help in creating articles for [my blog tedt.org]. Your first task will be to understand my writing style based on examples that I give you. After that, we'll create some content. To start, please say GO AHEAD and I will paste examples of my writing. Keep saying GO AHEAD and I will paste new examples. When I am done I will give you additional instructions. 
```
Now you will copy and paste examples of your own writing style. If you are doing this for a blog, use blog posts you have written in the past that were well accepted. If this is for work related activities, use some of the work your co-workers think were effective. I used 5 blog posts.

```markdown
Great. Let's call this "[TT writing style]". First, can you summarize [TT writing style] in a bullet points? Focus on the sentence structure, tone and voice so that I can give your description to someone else to emulate my style of writing.
```

Now for me, the following was spit out:

```markdown
Sure! Here's a summary of the "[TT writing style]" based on the examples you provided:

### Sentence Structure
- **Varied Sentence Lengths**: Uses a mix of short and long sentences to create a natural flow.
- **Descriptive Details**: Includes vivid descriptions and sensory details to paint a clear picture.
- **Narrative Flow**: Often follows a narrative structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- **Dialogue and Thoughts**: Incorporates dialogue and internal thoughts to add depth and perspective.

### Tone
- **Reflective and Thoughtful**: Often reflects on personal experiences and deeper meanings.
- **Emotional and Honest**: Expresses genuine emotions and personal insights.
- **Conversational**: Maintains a conversational tone, making the reader feel engaged and connected.

### Voice
- **Personal and Intimate**: Shares personal stories and experiences, creating an intimate connection with the reader.
- **Philosophical and Contemplative**: Explores philosophical ideas and contemplative thoughts.
- **Hopeful and Inspirational**: Often conveys a sense of hope and inspiration, especially in relation to faith and spirituality.
```

Now when you are writing something you can say:

```markdown
I have written a blog post, please rewrite this using my own voice as defined in the Voice section of this prompt.
