> In Christian times, St. George, the patron Saint of knights and rich lords, often took his place. In fact, the old pilgrimage church is dedicated to St. George, and the noisy retinue of the pagan god sometimes becomes an army of restless spirits that still fill with their haunting the areas where their lord and master was once most eagerly worshipped. St. George's Hill is an ancient cultural site; it was a natural sacrificial altar for pagan feasts; a Roman fort also stood on it, then in the Middle Ages a small Beguinage Monastery, all of which folklore has recorded in its legends down to our time.

> Traveling pilgrims have peered into the rock face through the mountain cliff and discovered immeasurable treasures of gold and silver there, as on the higher stone wall and in the golden hole of the nearby Alp Sennis.  The stones of this area are said to have turned into gold for the traders from Venice, and from it they are said to have taken all their riches. 
> 
> On the heights of the smooth rock face, inaccessible to ordinary people, there is a collection of buildings and in the middle of them several chapels.  Someplace among those chapels there is a door that leads inside the mountain to its hidden treasures. This door opens at certain times, even in broad daylight. When this happens men, who look like clergymen come out, climb up the rock face to the top, one does not understand how, and sun their vestments and all kinds of precious artifacts there between the chapels. During this time, no one dared to climb the heights. When they have solarized their treasures long enough, they return, and disappear into the mountainside, and the door closes again. 
> 
> At night, however, much more sinister things happen on the heights. Often, when in the villages of Flums or Bärschis the bells have struck the midnight hour and the valley lies in deepest darkness, the mountain suddenly becomes light up there, and one sees black figures setting something up between the the two chapels.  Then the figures appear to tirelessly throw two golden balls at giant silver pins.  Down below  you can clearly hear the muffled rolling of the balls, the falling of the pins they hit, and the confused voices of the men.  This goes on until on the stroke of one o'clock everything suddenly falls silent and they all disappear. 
> 
> Some of the black figures wear white headgear, but for most of them there is nothing white left. Those with white clothing are said to be redeemable still, while the latter are not.
> 
> According to O. Giger.
