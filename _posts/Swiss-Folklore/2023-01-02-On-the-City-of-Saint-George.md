# On the City of Saint Geroge

Wodan, the god of the winds, is also the god of the creatures of the night. In Christian times, St. George, the patron Saint of knights and rich lords, often took his place. In fact, the old pilgrimage church is dedicated to St. George, and the noisy retinue of the former pagan god sometimes becomes an army of restless spirits that still fill with their haunting the areas where their lord and master was once most eagerly worshipped. St. George's Hill is an ancient cultural site; it was a natural sacrificial altar for pagan feasts; a Roman fort also stood on it, then in the Middle Ages a small Beguinage Monastery, all of which folklore has recorded in its legends down to our time. 

According to Dr. E. Buss

* * *

Traveling students peered into the rock face through the mountain mirror and discovered immeasurable treasures of gold and silver there, as on the higher Steienwand and in the gold hole of the nearby Alp Sennis. For the people of Venice, the stones of this area turned into gold, and from it they are said to have taken all their riches. On the smooth rock face, inaccessible to ordinary people, in the middle of the chapels, there is a door that leads inside the mountain to the treasures. This door opens at times in broad daylight. Clergymen come out of it, climb up the rock face to the top, one does not understand how, and sun their vestments and all kinds of precious utensils there between the chapels. During this time, no one dared to climb the heights. When they have solarized their treasures long enough, they return, and disappear into the mountainside, and the door closes again. At night, however, much more sinister things happen on the heights. Often, when in the villages of Flums or Bärschis the bells have struck the midnight hour and the valley lies in deepest darkness, it suddenly becomes light up there, and one sees black figures pushing bowling pins between the two chapels. With two golden balls they throw tirelessly at silver pins, and down below you can clearly hear the muffled rolling of the balls, the falling of the pins they hit, and the confused voices of the men, until on the stroke of one o'clock everything suddenly falls silent and disappears. Some of the black figures wear white headgear, but for most of them there is nothing white left. The former are still redeemable, the latter are not.

According to O. Giger.
