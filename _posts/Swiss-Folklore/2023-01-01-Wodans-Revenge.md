> # Wodan's Revenge
>
>When the pagan deities succumbed to the Christianity and also the inhabitants of Vaud swore to the its new doctrine, the resentment of the defeated gods against their former followers was so great that they sought to harm them as much as possible in their temporal good by the elements over which they had not yet completely lost power at that time, in order to punish them for their apostasy and to make their faith in the new god waver. First of all it was Wodan, the first of the pagan gods, who took such revenge. Sometimes he roared as an unleashed storm, sometimes on the cloud of thunder, destroying the fields and crops of rich and poor.
>
>Thus he once came down the Rhône in the old splendor on a high-built wave, like sitting on a war horse, holding a battle sword in one hand and the globe in the other. Then he shouted, "River, Rise!" and the Rhône rose at his command, flooded the bank and, devastating the whole area, swept away part of St. Maurice.  The only place unharmed by the flood was the place where the altar to the new God was erected. Only then did Wodan realize his powerlessness against the Christian God.
>
>Never again since that time has Wodan shown himself to mankind, never again has he dared to try again to found his kingdom among them. Only at night, at certain times of the year, he still lets himself be heard in the roar of the storm, high up on the glaciers, between rocks and stones, in the gloomy forest floor, but more to torment himself than to the harm of mankind. Unseen by human eyes, he then walks along them in a hideous procession, Freya, his wife, once a kind goddess, now an evil sorceress, at his side, and what is eternally damned follows him: Suicides, drunkards, unbaptized dead children, beheaded and hanged malefactors, [voluptuous women](#what){: .who}[^1]{: .where}, witches and sorcerers, bloodthirsty mermaids and mischievous gnomes, in short, the host of all those evil spirits whose realm is the rocks and glaciers of the Alps.  It is said that heir number is so great that, if they were to divide amongst themselves those rocks and glaciers, hardly a pound of the mighty mass of ice and rock would be given to each one.

> Legends of nocturnal processions of ghosts, which at certain times of the year can be heard in the air with a terrible noise, are at home not only in Switzerland, but in all parts of the sky. But wherever one meets them, they owe their first appearance to the sonorous vibrations of the air, which are wont to precede great changes in temperature; That is why it is also said in the legend of the WuütiSsheere that e8 is at its most mad at Christmas time, at which time violent nightly storms usually announce the beginning of winter. As far as the legend of the raging army or Wütisheere, as it is called in the Bernese Oberland, is concerned, it is very old and is closely connected to the highest deity of our pagan ancestors, Wodan, as is his name, furious army, southern German: Muotes Heer, originally meant nothing else than the Wuotane army. Our ancestors thought of the all-father Odin, Othan, Wuotan or Wodan among other expressions of his all-pervading power as the guide of the battles and as the guide of the heroes who fell in battle in their heavenly hunting pleasures in Valhalla, which they carried over their heads to the sound of the air heard. At Scchonen, a peculiar noise, probably originating from seabirds, which can be heard on the evenings of December, is still called Odens Jagd. However, the sensuous myth in which paganism had clothed the natural phenomenon of the howling storm wind was later obscured by the victorious Christianity, in that here, as everywhere else where the remains of the old faith could not be completely supplanted, the same were replaced by ugly, distorting additions or tried to bring changes into another terrifying version. Thus it transformed the almighty sky-god Odin or Wodan into the devil, and the spirits of the happily departed heroes led by him into the souls of the eternally damned, who, as a raging host, that deity in her new form at the spear, superstitious minds at that moment> fill noFg with fear and screams. But the fact that the devil in the above saga relinquishes his office as leader of the raging army to the gigantic Uroin inhabitants of the country (the idea that giants are his leaders is the more general one in Switzerland) lies in the close connection which, according to the Christian mythical point of view between the idea of ​​the devil and that of the giants, a point to which we shall return later.
