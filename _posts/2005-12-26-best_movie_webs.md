I ran into <a href="http://doublefeaturefinder.com/" target="_blank">this</a> page on [Digg](http://digg.com). I&#8217;m definitly going to remember where it is for my next long Saturday / Sunday when I have no plans. The site allows individuals to plan double features. The interface can use a bit of work, but definitly worth remembering.
