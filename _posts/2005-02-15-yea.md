**[AutoStitch](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html)** is the world&#8217;s first fully automatic 2D image stitcher. Capable of stitching full view panoramas _without any user input whatsoever_, AutoStitch is a breakthrough technology for panoramic photography, VR and visualisation applications.
