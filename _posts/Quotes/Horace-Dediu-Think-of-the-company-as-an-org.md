quote: Think of the company as an organism. Inside this organism there are entities
    -- be they people, budgets, processes, or rules in binders. These are things that
    are designed to eat up innovation. To eat up changes to the core business. Companies
    do this not because they are stupid, but because they see this newcomer, this
    entrant, as a pathogen. It is seen as something that's damaging the organism.
    So they act, and sometimes even collude, to destroy it.  They are paid good money
    to do that. Their incentives are all very clear and they go to their boss every
    year and get a raise because they've been successful. You have to understand that
    no matter how muich someone, even the CEO, has a vision, if the organization underneath
    has not been properly incentivized to absorb the change, it's almost impossible
    to build that kind of structure. It's schizophrenic to accept this intruder that's
    trying to take away your core business.
