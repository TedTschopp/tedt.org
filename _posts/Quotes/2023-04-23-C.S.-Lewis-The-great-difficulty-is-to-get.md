The great difficulty is to get modern audiences to realize that you are preaching
  Christianity soley and simply because you happen to think it true; they always suppose
  you are preaching it because you like it or think it good for society or something
  of that sort. Now a clearly maintanied distinction between what the Faith actually
  says and what you would like it to have said or what you understand or what you
  personally find helpful or think probable, forces your audience to realize that
  you are tied to your data just as the scientist is tied by the results of the experiments;
  that you are not just saying what you like. This immediately helps them realize
  that what is being discussed is a question about objective fact â€” not gas about
  ideals and points of view.
