quote: Jesus Christ did not say, ‘Go into all the world and tell the world that it
    is quite right.’ The Gospel is something completely different. In fact, it is
    directly opposed to the world.

*Question:* Do you feel, then, that modern culture is being de-Christianized?

*C.S Lewis:* I cannot speak to the political aspects of the question, but I have some definite views about the de-Christianizing of the church. I believe that there are many accommodating preachers, and too many practitioners in the church who are not believers. Jesus Christ did not say, ‘Go into all the world and tell the world that it is quite right.’ The Gospel is something completely different. In fact, it is directly opposed to the world.
