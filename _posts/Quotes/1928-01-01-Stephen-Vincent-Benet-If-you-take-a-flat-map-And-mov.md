If you take a flat map \
And move wooden blocks upon it strategically, \
The thing looks well, the blocks behave as they should. \
The science of war is moving  live men like blocks. \
And getting the blocks into place at a fixed moment.

But it takes time to mold your men into blocks \
And flat maps turn into country  where creeks and gullies \
Hamper your wooden squares. They stick in the brush,

They are tired and rest, they straggle after ripe blackberries, \
And you cannot  lift them up in your hand and move them. \
--A string of blocks curling smoothly  around the left \
Of another string of blocks and crunching it up-- \
It is all  so clear in the maps, so clear in the mind, \
But the orders are slow, the men  in the blocks are slow \
To move, when they start they take too long on the way--

The General loses his stars and the block-men die \
In unstrategic defiance of martial law \
Because still used to just being men, not block-parts.
