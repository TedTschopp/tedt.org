This is a book!\

I would deny\
The right of those who terrify\
And use as constant tools of trade:\
"Aren't you afraid? Aren't you afraid?"\
Of what? I ask.\
"Computers! Aren't they monsters?\
Aren't they bad?"

That makes me mad, that maddens me.\
The fools! Good Grief, they're blind.\
Refuse to find and see\
What damned computers mean to me!\
Their digitals which perk and hide\
Inside electric circuitries,\
Provide with ease such medicines\
As we most need, and find within:\
They make a digitalis!\
Good!!\
Which sums the substance in the blood\
And quickens odd-shaped humanoid\
To fill my void with swift replies.

Where boredom once let ennui in,\
Computer says: take heart -- begin!\
Much more than brute machine I'll be,\
And constantly your whims attend,\
Show ends where no ends were before;\
And, more! Show starts as well as finishes.

Your Will diminishes at thought of sums?\
So! quick computer this way comes!\
As out in mystery of Space\
We race a similar mystery: Us,\
And need the plus and minor factors\
To teach reactors how to stride\
And fill lost human souls with pride;

And all by, quickly, under breath\
Do Death in which such computations\
As would force-feed nations of dreams;\
Build schemes on air that ratify\
Grand architectures in the sky --\
Whole cities beehived in one ship\
To solve a trip and save a Race,\
And multiply Man's hopes in Space.

So microprocessor takes breath and air\
And manufactures rare and simple words\
That aviaries are to boys like birds\
To fount them high in July rockets\
With seedpod futures in their pockets;\
Decisions bought from indecisions,\
Collisions of free-fall thought fused one,\
The fun of mathematics nimble\
In thimbles plug-tamped in your ear\
And cheerful wisdom played like drum\
On listening learner's tympanum.

We are, at last, a traveling feast,\
With yeast that spawns electrically,\
And teaches children what they'll be\
If with tape libraries they keep\
And wake the processors from sleep.\
To ask us questions, then stand mum\
As proper answers thrive and sum.\
So, look!\
This is a book!\
But no page turns.\
Only beneath the metal burns\
Such stuffs as all new times are made of.\
So, Cowards, what are you afraid of?
