There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations,
  cultures, arts, civilizations–these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the
  life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and
  exploit–immortal horrors or everlasting splendours. This does not mean that we are
  to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of the kind (and
  it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the
  outset, taken each other seriously–no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.
