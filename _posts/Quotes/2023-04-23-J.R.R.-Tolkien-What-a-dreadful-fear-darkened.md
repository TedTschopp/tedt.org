quote: "What a dreadful, fear-darkened, sorrow-laden world we live in\u2026  It is\
  \ our duty to keep the Flag of the World flying: but it takes now a sturdier and\
  \ more sublime patriotism than it did then.  \u2026It is not for us to choose the\
  \ times into which we are born, but to do what we could to repair them; but the\
  \ spirit of wickedness in high places is now so powerful and so many headed in its\
  \ incarnations that there seems nothing more to do than to personally refuse to\
  \ worship any of the hydra\u2019s heads."

'What a dreadful, fear-darkened, sorrow-laden world we live in…  It is our duty to keep the Flag of the World flying: but it takes now a sturdier and more sublime patriotism than it did then.  …It is not for us to choose the times into which we are born, but to do what we could to repair them; but the spirit of wickedness in high places is now so powerful and so many headed in its incarnations that there  seems nothing more to do than to personally refuse to worship any of the hydra’s heads.'
