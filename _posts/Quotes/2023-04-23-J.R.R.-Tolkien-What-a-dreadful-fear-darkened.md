quote: 'What a dreadful, fear-darkened, sorrow-laden world we live in…  It is our
  duty to keep the Flag of the World flying: but it takes now a sturdier and more
  sublime patriotism than it did then.  …It is not for us to choose the times into
  which we are born, but to do what we could to repair them; but the spirit of wickedness
  in high places is now so powerful and so many headed in its incarnations that there
  seems nothing more to do than to personally refuse to worship any of the hydra’s
  heads.'
