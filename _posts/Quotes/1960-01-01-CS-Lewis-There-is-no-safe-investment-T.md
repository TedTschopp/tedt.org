There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything
  and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make
  sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no-one...   Wrap it carefully
  around with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe
  in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket-safe, dark, motionless,
  airless-it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable,
  irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is
  damnation. The only place outside heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all
  the dangers and perturbations of love is hell.
