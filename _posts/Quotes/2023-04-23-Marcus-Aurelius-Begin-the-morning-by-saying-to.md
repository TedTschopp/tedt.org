quote: Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the
  ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them
  by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature
  of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature
  of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed,
  but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity,
  I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly,
  nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation,
  like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.
  To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against
  one another to be vexed and to turn away.
