This article in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,65865,00.html) reports on progress being made to produce &#8220;open&#8221; virtual worlds, which evolve based on the creativity of their inhabitants, rather than according to patterns set by programmers as in traditional multiuser online games such as [Everquest](http://eqlive.station.sony.com/) or [The Sims](http://thesims.ea.com/). The potential of open virtual worlds has been [revealed](http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?res=9A05E7DC1E3CF932A25752C1A9629C8B63) in new commercial ventures such as [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/play.php) from [Linden Lab](http://lindenlab.com/), which has yielded [theme parks](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/17/1959250&tid=209), [news blogs](http://www.alphavilleherald.com/), [XML-RPC connections](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/15/1657206&tid=206&tid=209&tid=10) for exchanging data with the rest of the Internet, and a real world [currency exchange](http://www.gamingopenmarket.com/). Developers are now taking extensibility a step further by building virtual worlds based on [open source software](http://www.gamingopenmarket.com/), which are not controlled by any single organization, commercial or otherwise. Efforts underway include the [Open Source Metaverse Project](http://metaverse.sourceforge.net/) (OSMP), [Croquet](http://nooface.com/article.pl?sid=04/10/12/2121239&mode=thread), and [MUPPETS](http://muppets.rit.edu/muppetsweb/about/index.php). Some of these projects are clearly inspired by the [Metaverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) described in Neal Stephenson&#8217;s novel [Snow Crash](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/qid=1102394072/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-9412722-9389460).
