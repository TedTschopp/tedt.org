## Start Here

The attributes of a character are given as numerical values which can change as the game progresses, and characters grow and develop over the course of their adventures.

When you are creating a character you can create a character several ways.

1. Roll 5d8 dropping the lowest die roll and using the following table to determine your result.  You then distribute those numbers to the aspects and characteristics you desire.

2. Use the Standard Array: [3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-2]. You then distribute those numbers to the aspects and characteristics you desire.

3. Use the Narrative Approach
   1. As a Child you were known to be stronger, smarter, more socially aware, or more spiritually aware.  Assign 3 points Aspect you were strongest in.
   2. Tell me the story about what happened to make you stand out among your peers, was it the overall strength, speed, or balance between those two that made you stand out.  Assign 2 points to the Characteristics that represent that.
   3. As a child you were know to be the least gifted in Fitness, Academics, Mystical arts, or Emotion.  Assign -2 points to the aspect you were weakest in.
   4. Tell me the story about what happened to make you stand out among your peers, was it the lack of strength, speed, or balance between strength and speed that made you stand out.  Assign -1 point to the characteristics that represented that.
   5. Assign 1's to the rest
   6. subtract -1 from 2 aspects / characteristics
   7. add 1 to 3 aspects / characteristics

## Aspects

All beings have four aspects of their existence. These define the highest categorical breakdown of a being. They are Physical, Mental, Social, and Spiritual. They each have a numeric score The higher the score, the more potential that being has in that aspect of their existence. These numbers also represent how much damage the character can take. These aspects can be broken down into your Characteristics.  

| Aspect Name | Aspect Value |
|------------:|:-------------|
|     Fitness | (-4 thru 4)  |
|    Academic | (-4 thru 4)  |
|    Mystical | (-4 thru 4)  |

All characters have certain basic characteristics that define what they can do. Each of these characteristics fall into a given aspect.

As part of creating your character, you decide how strong, smart, and tough your character is by choosing the appropriate characteristic scores.

## Knowledge Areas

You acquire knowledge through experience or education. You can acquire knowledge without applying it. This is what happens when you rely on your Aspects and Characteristics to get accomplish a task. Overtime you will acquire enough knowledge to finally develop enough proficiency to gain a skill in that area. When this is done in a controlled environment like an educational institution or from an instructor or a tutor, you gain the knowledge on how these skills apply to your other Aspects and Characteristics. If, however you have no formal teacher or you are out discovering something new at the bleeding edge of technical development for your culture, you only get to apply the Aspects and Characteristics associated with your skill to the task at hand.

You demonstrate competency, and thus succeeding in your knowledge area rolls, by applying the necessary knowledge and skill in a real-world setting where you take full responsibility and accountability for your actions. The experience gained in this manner distinguishes demonstrated skill from demonstrated competency.

Each Level in a knowledge area represents a grade level with level 0 being the knowledge the general public gets in this discipline. You are an apprentice or have an associate degree if you have a knowledge are at level 1. You are a journeyman or you have a Bachelor’s degree at level 2. You are a master or you have a master’s degree at level 3. You are a grand master or you have a doctorate degree at level 4. If you are looking for levels above that, at level 5 someone is a principality, power, or demigod. Gods start coming in at level 6.

## Hallmarks

Hallmarks represent what makes your character unique beyond just a set of numbers.  As your character grows, their hallmarks will also grow.  

### Environmental Hallmarks

Environmental hallmarks represent the knacks, insights and ‘survival secrets’ handed down by different people over the years, giving heroes raised in those cultures an edge.

This represents the natural environment the character grew up in or spends their time in. A character who grew up in an urban area that never got out of the city may not have an Environmental Hallmark.

### Urban Hallmarks

Urban hallmarks represent the knacks, insights and ‘street secrets’ handed down by different people over the years, giving heroes raised in those urban settings an edge.

### Occupational Hallmarks

Occupational hallmarks represent the knacks, insights and ‘craft secrets’ handed down by different trades over the years, giving heroes who have those jobs an edge.

Pick an occupation that is culturally appropriate for the setting of the game and note it down. This represents the occupational environment the character grew up in or surrounds themselves when they are not adventuring.

#### Careers

As a part of their development, characters follow certain life paths called careers. The setting you play in will provide a variety of career options for characters to pursue, which opens opportunities for characters to gain skill levels, characteristic boosts and significant mustering out benefits before they enter into play.

Careers are part of a setting, and the process to place a character into a career is determined by the settings rules/

### Recreational Hallmarks

Recreational hallmarks represent the knacks, insights and nuanced differentiations handed down by enthusiasts over the years, giving heroes raised in those cultures an edge.

Pick a hobby that is culturally appropriate for the setting of the game and note it down. This represents how the character prefers to spend their free time relaxing.

### Community Hallmarks

Community Hallmarks are qualities that describe different aspects of a character’s build, temperament, and abilities, which can provide advantages in certain situations. The key principle governing Community Hallmarks is that their descriptions must make it reasonably believable that individuals possessing those qualities would perform better under the given circumstances compared to those who lack them. Virtues are not ranked and cannot be enhanced or improved.

A Character may end up with more than one Community Hallmark, the one rule governing this is that a character cannot have opposing Hallmarks. Use the table below to identify opposing Community Hallmarks. In many cases there are multiple virtues that are similar to each other if players want to play a character who is conflicted.

|       Virtue | Description                                                                                                                             | Opposing Virtue | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Gear

You don't find yourself under a familiar roof for much of the year. You may opt for an outdoor lifestyle, or circumstances may compel you to take refuge in unconventional locations or seek shelter in remote areas. Your first test of skill is choosing the right amount of equipment to carry, aiming for a manageable load—an indication of your expertise in the field. The same principle applies to your tactical gear. You must resist the temptation to opt for the most powerful weapons and most protective armor, as such heavy and unwieldy burdens are likely to significantly impede your operational capabilities.

### Pocket Money

You do not have to keep track of accommodation, food, or incidental travel expenses as long as your Hero's spending stays within the limits of their pocket money. These limits are determined by the Referee.

Money will likely only become a concern during play when large amounts are being spent. This could include preparing for a major trip, purchasing expensive items like a vehicle or rare book, or hiring extra staff.

If you spend an amount beyond your 'spending limit,' you must reduce your cash by the full amount spent. If you don't have enough cash, you can consider using your assets. Converting assets into cash takes time, and the duration is determined by the Referee. Processes like mortgaging a property, selling antiques, converting assets into pocket money, or obtaining loans all require time. If you are away from your hometown, these processes are likely to take even longer.

If you make multiple purchases below your spending threshold on the same day, the Referee may require you to combine the total purchases to compare them with your spending level. If you exceed the spending limit, you'll need to deduct the excess cash spent. The above tables will give you and the Referee guidelines on how to handle this.

| **Pocket Money Rating** | **Description**                                         | **Accommodations**                                            | **Forms of Travel**                                      | **Rules Notes**                                                                                                                                                      |

During the game, your character may receive a substantial sum of money as a reward. Treat such windfalls as Assets.

Taking on and repaying debts is all part of your story. It could involve selling your Hero's car or seeking money from a loan shark. While financial transactions are not the main focus of play, the gradual decline of your character's finances may go hand-in-hand with the deterioration of your Mental, Social, or Spiritual Aspects.

### Personal Possessions

You embark on your journey fully prepared for long periods of travel and sleeping in the open. It is expected that every character carries the necessary equipment for an adventurous life. This equipment consists of two main categories: Equipment and Operational Gear.

#### Equipment

You can apply the same approach when you're wondering if your character should already possess a specific item as part of their standard belongings. If you find yourself in this situation, ask yourself (or consult the Referee) about the relevance of the object to your character's profession. In such cases, your character's occupation should offer the most insights, particularly when considering their appropriate Pocket Money.

Should you, as a Thief, carry a set of lock-picks with you? Absolutely, and make sure it's a top-notch set.

Should you, as a Chef, own a set of high-quality knives? Definitely, and they should be well-maintained and sharp.

Should you, as a Photographer, have a reliable camera? Of course, and it should be capable of capturing high-resolution images.

Should you, as a Software Developer, possess a powerful laptop? Yes, and it should have enough processing power and memory to handle your tasks efficiently.

Should you, as a Mechanic, have a comprehensive set of tools? Absolutely, and they should be organized for easy access and use.

#### Operational Gear

At the start of the game, you can equip your character with any weapon your hero is capable of wielding, as well as any shield and armor you choose to carry or wear. If your hero loses or breaks any of these items, they will be automatically replaced the next time you reach a friendly settlement or at another suitable moment in the story. If the settlement isn't from your hero's own community, you might be asked to perform a small favor in return, such as completing a task or sharing a song or tale.

#### Curated Gear

At the start of the game, you select your operative's initial equipment. This includes standard-issue weapons, a set of tactical armor, and perhaps additional protective gear like a helmet or shield and a cell phone.

Curated Gear is another matter. Curated Gear can be Specialized tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items. Such items could be gifts / loans from your organization, family, or perhaps a high-ranking official allows you to choose a piece of equipment from their private arsenal. Alternatively, you might have personally modified, repaired, or adapted this gear to meet your specific needs. The types of modifications and customizations depend on both the item itself and the technology or culture that produced it, as well as your own operative's background.

Whenever your operative advances in rank, you earn a Bonus. This Bonus allows you to enhance one piece of equipment with a new specialized feature. Each time your operative acquires an item of exceptional quality, you should craft a narrative to commemorate this milestone for your character.

If your character happens to lose any of their Curated Gear, they will be able to acquire standard Operational Gear to replace it. However, all the customizations, advanced features, and other unique aspects of that gear will be lost until you retrieve them. You may choose to abandon this equipment, but doing so will affect your reputation and may lead to other unintended consequences, depending on who ends up with the gear.  In either event, such losses will effect the overall narrative structure of your story.

##### Specialized Tools

You'll come across objects that stand out for their exceptional and mesmerizing qualities. Whether it's gemstones, secure data drives, advanced biotech implants, holographic storage modules, energy-efficient components, neural interfaces, nanotech-enhanced accessories, or quantum processors, you'll recognize these as Specialized Tool. Their unique charm stems from the expertise of talented engineers, state-of-the-art technology, or the incorporation of specialized algorithms or energy systems.

Specialized Tools are your everyday equipment that has been tailored, specialized, or masterfully crafted to stretch the limits of what's achievable or to showcase the engineer's skills. These items are typically not weapons or armor; they are tools designed for a specific function. Generally, there's no backstory or narrative tied to these objects, but they are readily available to agents who have proven their worth.

##### Elite Gear

You encounter items that possess extraordinary capabilities, which most people would consider highly advanced or even miraculous. These may include state-of-the-art stealth suits that make the wearer undetectable to security systems, sonic devices that can manipulate emotions in both allies and enemies, and augmented reality implants that enable the user to effortlessly locate and retrieve misplaced objects. These remarkable items come with advanced technological enhancements that amplify the innate skills of their users. The more advanced your expertise and status, the better you'll understand these assets and the benefits they offer.

While these items are generally not classified as weapons, they are valuable assets often carried by the elite operatives or experts in this world. Each of these technological marvels has a rich backstory, offering clues to their origins and unique capabilities, adding layers of depth and intrigue to their existence.

##### Named Items

You will occasionally encounter Precious and Named Objects that bear specific designations. These are often identified by the name of their inventor or their most renowned owner. However, Named Items always possess distinct names and may even have multiple names, as they are known and referred to differently among various organizations or cultures. Once you utilize one long enough, these items may acquire additional names based on your actions or what you choose to call them.

Named Items, each possessing unique capabilities, may have visual or auditory cues that make them stand out, such as a distinct light or sound. However, in some cases, these special qualities are more discreet, barely noticeable to the untrained eye. It's important to note that every Iconic Item has a rich backstory that merits thorough investigation.

These items are not just defined by their own characteristics but also by their inventors, the cultures or organizations from which they originate, the significant events they have been part of, and the diverse groups of people who have utilized them throughout history. All these factors contribute to the advantages and drawbacks that these items carry. While you may not be aware of all the intricate details surrounding an Famous Artifacts, as an operative, you may wish to uncover these hidden truths through various means, such as research, consultation with experts, or undertaking special missions.

You will find that sponsors, leaders, and subject matter experts from different organizations possess extensive knowledge about these items. Seeking their guidance will prove invaluable in unraveling the hidden histories of these assets. By consulting with these knowledgeable individuals, you can delve deeper into the origins, significance, and remarkable stories associated with these items.

Moreover, it's worth noting that any equipment you acquire classified as Exceptional Quality or above holds potential for further interactions. You can exchange such exceptional items with the aforementioned leaders to unlock additional features and capabilities that lie within the exceptional items found in Caches. This exchange opens up new possibilities and enhances the potential of these powerful assets, allowing you to tap into their full capabilities and utilize them to your advantage.

### Assets

You and your team will inevitably encounter various assets as you navigate through unfamiliar territories. It could be the long-forgotten hoard of a deceased Dragon, or the hidden cache left behind by a rogue spy agency, a valuable stash of data and technology guarded by a rogue AI, or the accumulated resources amassed by generations of space pirates. These Assets offer you and your colleagues a compelling objective for your missions, an opportunity to increase your personal resources, and a means to uncover hidden stories from the regions you explore.

#### How Assets Works

You accumulate wealth as you acquire materials and items of significant value, such as currency, valuable data, and specialized technology. These possessions signify wealth far beyond the ordinary, and you have the option to invest your Assets when you're not actively engaged in missions or operations. The value of each Asset is determined by a rating system, starting at a minimum of 1, which roughly corresponds to the resources necessary to sustain an operative for a month at a Prosperous Standard of Living, and potentially scaling upwards from there.

You record your personal Assets rating on the back of your character sheet and keep it updated as you discover and utilize it. When you and your fellow Company members come across a treasure, you must distribute it among yourselves, dividing its rating as you deem appropriate and noting your individual shares on your character sheets. If you have people accompanying you on your adventures that require payment, you must also share this treasure with them according to the rules outlined for them.

You have the opportunity to utilize the wealth indicated by your Asset rating when you decide to dedicate a Season to staying at home. During this period, you can engage in various types of investments, each requiring a specific amount of Asset points. These investments will shape the activities you pursue throughout the season.

| Rating | Description                                                                                                    |
|:------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1    | Sufficient funds to sustain you at a Prosperous Standard of Living for a month.                                |
|   2    | Enough funds for a month-long bender of indulgence in the neon-lit underbelly of the city.                     |
|   5    | A gift fit for royalty, an extravagant treasure.                                                               |

|   50   | A substantial treasure amassed by an Orc chieftain.                                                            |

|  500   | A comprehensive database of government secrets, exposing the hidden truths behind the city's power structures. |
| 1,000  | fragment of a legendary extraterrestrial relic said to possess immense cosmic power.                           |

#### Carrying and Transporting Assets

You, as a player, have the option to take on the responsibility of managing the assets you acquire, whether it's transporting secure data drives or carrying specialized equipment. Each unit of asset you carry adds to your Encumbrance, resulting in a one-point increase to your Fatigue rating for every unit of asset you choose to manage. It's important to consider the implications of carrying too much in the way of assets, as it affects your character's overall stamina.

#### Hiding Assets

The currency, data files, technology, or other property that a few units of Asset represent might be more than you're willing to manage during your missions. You may choose to secure your assets in a nearby safe location, planning to return later to retrieve them.

#### Cache

Assets may not degrade like other mundane materials, certain resources possess a corruptive influence that surpasses tangible goods. The allure of valuable assets can ignite a fierce desire within those who seek them. You understand the distinction between a payment for your services from a corporation and a hidden stash of confidential data stored in a secure server. Both hold value, but the latter is a Cache, possessing an additional allure and a darker influence. The valuables you uncover within a rogue agency's hidden base or stored within a long-forgotten data vault may carry a taint, their value capable of driving individuals to distraction and filling their hearts with insatiable ambition.

You must pass a Mystic test upon discovering tainted Cache, or you'll suffer Spiritual Damage.

In addition to just currency and valuable data, a Cache can also contain other items such as advanced technology, high-value art pieces, and other renowned or long-forgotten intellectual property.

## Property

Throughout the campaign, you may acquire a Property. In a fantasy setting, this could be a business like a smithy or a tavern. Alternatively, you might own a farm where peasants till the land and share a portion of each harvest with you. In a modern context, your Property could be a tech startup or a small consultancy firm. Property aren't limited to physical assets; your family and home could also constitute a Property.

Your Property serves as your main occupation when you're not out adventuring or, in a modern scenario, when you're not engaged in other high-stakes activities. Not everyone has a Property.

### Rating

There are multiple avenues for you to acquire a Property. You might inherit one from a wealthy family member if you're lucky. More commonly, you gain a Property as the outcome of an adventure, either as a gift or by discovering an unclaimed Property and taking it for yourself.

{: .well .table .table-striped }


The worth of your Property is quantified in game terms by a numerical rating that ranges from 1 to 8. This rating is similar to the Target Number for an action, where a lower number is generally more desirable than a higher one. For instance, a struggling farm on a rocky hillside might have a rating of 1, while a prosperous farm in an easily accessible, fertile valley could have a rating of 6.

### Minimum Score

You can't own a Property unless you have a minimum score in a relevant characteristic. If the Property is within the borders of your homeland, its rating is limited by your Social score. If the Property is located outside your homeland, then its rating is capped by your Reputation score.

### Running A Property

The day-to-day tasks of managing a business—like planting crops, mining ore, or forging tools—can be set aside in the game. It's assumed that you either have the necessary skills or can hire someone who does. What really matters is how your Property might evolve over time and what benefits it yields.

### Property Upkeep

You will need to make a roll for your Property during the last Season of each year if your hero possesses one.

If your roll result is equal to or lower than the Property's rating, your Property will generate enough wealth to maintain your character's Pocket Money level.

However, the Referee has the discretion to interpret a result of 1 or 2, based on the current circumstances, as the Property failing to produce sufficient wealth to cover your living expenses. In such cases, you may need to spend stored Assets to sustain your Pocket Money.

On the other hand, if your roll result exceeds the Property's rating, not only will your character enjoy their appropriate Pocket Money, but if the Property is capable of generating wealth (e.g., an inn or tracts of land), it will earn Assets equal to the difference between the roll and the rating.

For example, if you roll a 9 on a Property rated 6, you earn three Assets that year.

If the result is Good, then good fortune strikes you! You gain no extra Assets but prosper in some other way—perhaps a sick child recovers, an old feud is settled, or the weather is unusually pleasant. The rating for the Property is permanently lowered by 1 (to a minimum of 3).

If the result is bad, then the Property suffers some disaster or misfortune. If you don't take action in the next Season, the Property may be destroyed or have its rating increased.

## Bringing the Skills All Together

The Märchen Engine is outlined in the following framework that categorizes human abilities and skills into four primary aspects: Fitness, Academic, Mystical, and Emotional. Each primary aspect is further divided into three subcategories, which are then broken down into specific skills. The proficiency level for each Aspect is measured on a scale from -4 to 4 with 0 being human normal.  The proficiency level for each skill is measured on a scale from 0 to 4 with 0 representing an untrained level and 4 indicating a doctorate-level mastery.

### Fitness

This aspect covers physical abilities and is divided into Muscle, Agility, and Stamina.

- **Muscle** focuses on Ranged Combat, Athletics, and Melee Combat, measuring skills in using distance weaponry, physical exertion, and close combat, respectively.
- **Agility** includes Stealth, Acrobatics, and Sleight of Hand, assessing one's skill in moving quietly, performing complex bodily movements, and manual dexterity.
- **Stamina** comprises Drive/Ride/Pilot, Ruggedness, and Unarmed Combat, evaluating one's skill in controlling vehicles, physical endurance, and weaponless fighting techniques.

### Academic

This aspect pertains to intellectual abilities and includes Intellect, Reasoning, and Acuity.

- **Intellect** is divided into Social Sciences, Life Sciences, and Physical Sciences/Survival, measuring understanding of human society, living organisms, and the natural world.
- **Cunning** comprises Traditions, Perception, and Formal Sciences, evaluating understanding of cultural norms, heightened awareness, and mastery over formal systems like logic.
- **Reasoning** includes Engineering, Insight, and Investigation, assessing skills in building devices, discerning intentions, and finding clues.


### Mystical

This aspect deals with spiritual and magical abilities, divided into Skepticism, Faith, and Mystery.

- **Skepticism** includes Ethereal, Gnostic, and Chaos magic, measuring mastery over arcane magic, personal knowledge of the divine, and embracing unpredictability in magical systems.
- **Faith** is divided into Theurgy, Adept, and Order Magic, assessing traditional Western religious practices, mastery over vital energy, and a disciplined approach to magic.
- **Mystery** comprises Metaphysics, Animism, and Shamanism, evaluating exploration of psychic phenomena, belief in the spiritual essence of things, and acting as a conduit between physical and metaphysical realms.

### Emotional

This aspect focuses on emotional intelligence and social skills, divided into Manners, Personality, and Identity.

- **Manners** includes Style, Performance, and Etiquette, measuring skills in aesthetics, captivating an audience, and understanding social customs.
- **Personality** comprises Deception, Persuasion, and Intimidation, assessing skills in misleading others, influencing through tact, and using threats or force.
- **Identity** includes Bureaucracy, Animal Handling, and Leadership, evaluating understanding of social structures, skill in handling animals, and the ability to inspire and guide others.

## Task Resolution

### In Brief

1. Determine and add up the skill ( Aspect + Characteristic + Skill )
2. Determine and add up the circumstantial Dice Modifiers (⚅) using the table below
3. Roll a 4d8 and determine the σ using the table below:
4. Add up all the above numbers and compare them to the following table.  Sometimes an additional table will need to be consulted give the details of the skill or the circumstances (such as determining how long something took, or how much it will cost to repair an item.)

#### Degrees of Effect Defined

There are nine separate ways a predicament can be resolved:

##### Fail Catastrophically

This is a critical failure. The cost for this sort of failure means the outcome the actor was intending failed. Additionally, things have turned worse for that actor as well in unrelated areas or with a sense of
finality.

> For example, if a thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door, then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock. The trap in the door was triggered. Everyone in The Company must now determine if they are now poisoned, and no further attempts may be made (finality). In the event that overcoming this complication was required for The Company to accomplish their overall objectives, the GM must instead make the events turn to the worse in other areas. In the above example this would mean that in their attempts to pick the lock, the thief slipped, and knocked the torch out of the hands of the person carrying it, and the tapestry the door is behind is now on fire. Or the torch is now out and no one can see. The idea here is to heighten tension and make the attempt require larger efforts of heroics.

##### Costly

This is one step away from a critical failure. The cost should be
related to the outcome the player or monster was attempting.

> For example, if the thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door, then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock, but they did trigger the trap in the door, and everyone in The Company must now determine if they are poisoned.

##### Fail

This is a normal failure.

> In the example of our thief would not have been able to pick the lock, but the lock would not be jammed, and he would still have his pick.

##### Fail in Style

This is one step above a failure. It is still a failure, but something else has happened that moves the story forward in a more difficult path, but without accomplishing the goals.

> In the example of the thief, he wouldn't have picked the lock, but he did spring the trap and the door was opened, but everyone in The Company must determine if they are poisoned. This is the classic fail forward approach.

##### Tie

A tie succeeds unless this was a contest between two parties, in which case the outcome is that neither party gets what they want, and it should be treated as a fail in style for both sides. This is useful for social interactions or for contests of strength or agility.

> In the example of our thief the parties in question are the designer of the lock or door and The Company trying to get in. The thief would not get what they want, the lock to be picked, and the designer of the lock would not get what they want, to keep the lock secure. The resolution on this would be that the thief can’t open the lock with this action, but he has gained knowledge of the lock, which will make it easier for him next time. This wouldn’t be a problem for the thief unless he was doing this under a stress.

##### Succeed

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out to do.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism.

##### Succeed in Style

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out to do, and they got some hidden bonus or style out of it.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how that lock is constructed and the next one that is just like it will be easier to open.

##### Critical Success

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out todo, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any lock within this facility will be easier to open.

##### Serendipitous Success

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set out to do, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it that is completely unrelated to the task being attempted.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any lock within this facility will be easier to open. In addition, the thief see's the trap on the door as well and has a normal success to disarm it. The best way to see a serendipitous success is to see this as two completely independent successes on one die roll. In the event that a complication requires more than one success a serendipitous success will, in addition to everything above, add an additional success to the success pool.
