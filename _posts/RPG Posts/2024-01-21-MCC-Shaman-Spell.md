## R2D2 / C3PO Advertising Program Hologram Generation

### A Wetware Program

**Description:** This wetware program was developed to advertise the release of A New Home in yet another entertainment format.

**Background:** In our last Adventure, two of your characters got some wetware. You have the ability to share the program. Each time you share the spell the results table goes from a level 1 result table to a level 2 table to a level 3 table. You will no longer be able to share the wetware after you share it three times.

**Rules:**
