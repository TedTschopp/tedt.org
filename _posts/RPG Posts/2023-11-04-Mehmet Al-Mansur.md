|  Magery 2 (Mysticism): |  25   | The GM makes a Sense roll when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On  a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you     dangerous, and about how strong it is. Use IQ+2 when you learn spells. Add your Magery level to Perception When you roll to sense magic items roll Perception + 2, and to IQ +2 when you learn Thaumatology skill. Reduce the time required to  learn new spells in play to 80% the base time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|        Animal Empathy: |   5   | (for communicating with mundane and magical  creatures) You are unusually talented at reading  the motivations of animals. When you meet an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you "feel." This reveals the beastʼs  emotional state -- friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. -- and whether it is under  supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills on animals just as you would on  sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|      Empathic Healing: |  15   | (to aid injured mundane and magical beings) - You  have the ability to heal others by taking on the  injuries, diseases, and Afflictions by removing instead of paying FP. You must be in physical contact with the subject. To activate your power, concentrate for one second and make an IQ roll.  Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious. Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP (which is removed until you are healed) per 2 HP healed (round up).  Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d  damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to he crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM -- from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty,  minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. If  used more than once per day on a given subject,  apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of  the same type (injury or disease) on that subject.  This penalty accumulates until a full day has  passed since the most recent healing. Healing  works on your own race and on all "similar" races.

|              Intuition |  15   | You usually guess right. When faced with a number of alternatives, and no logical way to choose among them, you can ask the GM to let you use your Intuition. The GM makes a secret IQ roll, with a bonus equal to the number of "good" choices and a penalty equal to the number of "bad" choices. On a success, he steers you to a good choice; on a critical success, he tells you the best choice. On a failure, he gives you no information; on a critical failure, he steers you toward a bad choice. The GM can modify this as he sees fit for other situaKons where IntuiKon might logically help. Only one roll per quesKon is allowed. The GM should never allow IntuiKon to short-circuit an adventure – for instance, by lesng the intuiKve detecKve walk into a room, slap the cuffs on the guilty party, and close the case. At the most, IntuiKon would point the detecKve in the direcKon of a good clue. GMs who donʼt think they can control IntuiKon should not allow it in their games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            steers you toward a bad choice.

| Sense of Duty    | -10   | (Fellow Ottoman Refugees) - You feel a strong sense of commitment toward a particular class of people. You will never betray them, abandon them when theyʼre in trouble, or let them suffer or go hungry if you can help. This is different from a Duty (p. 133), which is imposed upon you. A Sense of Duty always comes from within. If you are known to have a Sense of Duty, the GM will adjust the reactions of others by +2 when rolling to see whether they trust you in a dangerous situation. However, if you go against your Sense of Duty by acting against the interests of those you are supposed to be looking out for, the GM will penalize you for bad roleplaying. You cannot claim points for a Sense of Duty toward Allies, Dependents, or Patrons. The point costs of these traits already take such a bond into account. You can take a Sense of Duty toward adventuring companions. If you do, you must share equipment with and render aid to the other members of your adventuring party, and go along with majority decisions. The GM might make this mandatory in games where the party needs to get along. This gives everyone a "free" 5 points to spend . . . but if you start backstabbing, running off on your own, etc., the GM is free to overrule your actions and point to these bonus points as the reason why. |
| Curious          | -5    | (drawn to mystical knowledge) - You are naturally very inquisitive. This is not the curiosity that affects all PCs ("Whatʼs in that cave? Where did the flying saucer come from?"), but the real thing ("What happens if I push this button?"). Make a self-control roll when presented with an interesting item or situation. If you fail, you examine it, push buttons, pull levers, open doors, unwrap presents, etc. -- even if you know it could be dangerous. Good roleplayers wonʼt try to make this roll very often... In general, you do everything in your power to investigate any situation with which you arenʼt 100% familiar. When faced with a real mystery, you simply cannot turn your back on it. You try to rationalize your curiosity to others who try to talk you out of it. Common Sense doesnʼt help -- you know you are taking a risk, but youʼre curious anyway!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Code of Honor    | -10   | (Protect Innocents) - This code requires the character to prioritize the safety and well-being of innocent people, intervening to prevent harm, avoid collateral damage, and seek justice for crimes against them. It demands respect for human life and dignity, active assistance to those in need, and reporting crimes witnessed. The character must endure personal hardship for the sake of innocents, avoid harming children under any circumstances, and provide aid while respecting the sanctity of life, even in the face of personal danger or adversity. Breaking this code may lead to moral dilemmas and penalties, but adhering to it offers opportunities for heroic actions and role-playing moments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Weirdness Magnet | -15   | (attracts supernatural events) - Strange and bizarre things happen to you with alarming frequency. You are the one demons stop and chat with. Magic items with disturbing properties find their way to you. The only talking dog on 21st-century Earth comes to you with his problems. Dimensional gates sealed for centuries crack open just so that you can be bathed in the energies released... or perhaps the entities on the other side invite you to tea. Nothing lethal happens to you, at least not immediately, and occasionally some weirdness is beneficial. But most of the time it is terribly, terribly inconvenient. People who understand what a Weirdness Magnet is (and that you are one) react to you at -2. The exceptions are parapsychologists, fringe cultists, unhinged conspiracy theorists, and thrill-seekers, who follow you around!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Phantom Voices   | -5    | (occasionally hears voices of nature and the Djinn) - You hear the voices of nature and the Djinn, but you have learned to integrate their voices into your day-to-day life, and in general these creatures and forces are not malicious. These whispers can sometimes provide insights or warnings, but they can also be distracting and disturbing, leading to difficulty concentrating or sleeping. You must make a self-control roll in stressful situations or when you need to focus. If you fail, the voices overwhelm your thoughts, potentially causing you to act irrationally or miss important details. Most people who see you responding to these noises that they can't hear will react at -2. If these voices persist, eventually, your sanity will start to erode. In any situation that the GM feels is stressful, they may roll 3d. On a 6 or less, you hear voices. The GM will always roll whenever you miss a Fright Check or make the roll exactly, and whenever you fail a self-control roll for another stress-related disadvantage. The voices occur in addition to any other results!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Sense of Duty    | -10   | (Protect Magical Beings) The GM rolls (Quite often/Hazardous - roll of 12 or less) at the beginning of each adventure to see whether it comes into play. Being "called to duty" could delay your plans... or be the reason for the adventure! Alternatively, your master might give you a secret agenda to pursue, or his associates might harass you while you are officially "on leave." If you try to avoid your Duty, your GM is within their rights to penalize you for bad role playing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Night Owl**                            | Mehmet often finds himself most active and alert during the late hours of the night, which can sometimes lead to unconventional sleep patterns.                                                                                                                       |
| **Keeps a Lucky Charm**                  | He carries a small, seemingly insignificant item as a lucky charm, believing it brings him good fortune and protection.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Fascination with Celestial Phenomena** | Mehmet has an intense fascination with celestial phenomena, such as stars, planets, and eclipses.

| **Superstitious**                        | He has a few superstitions he takes very seriously, such as avoiding certain numbers or making small gestures for luck.                                                                                                                                               |

| Occultism                 | 14         | This is the study of the mysterious and the supernatural. An occultist is an expert on ancient rituals, hauntings, mysticism, primitive magical beliefs, psychic phenomena, etc. Note that an occultist does not have to believe in the material he studies! In worlds where everyone knows that paranormal powers exist, Occultism covers lore about these powers and their users. A good roll might provide insights into phenomena that aren’t related to known powers. However, Occultism provides no details on how talented individuals invoke their powers. For instance, a fantasy occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without Thaumatology skill, he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Thaumatology              | 14         | This is the academic study of magical theory and the "physics" of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells. The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide. This is the study of fantasy magic -- fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to "standard" wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hidden Lore               | 14         | (Mysticism) This skill represents knowledge that is lost, deliberately hidden, or simply neglected. Whatever the reason, the general public is unaware of it. It is only available to those who study it specifically. You must specialize in a particular body of secret knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters... or to PCs in general! To acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts—such as reading moldy tomes—instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill. Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Research                  | 13         | This is the skill to do library and file research. Roll against skill to find a useful piece of data in an appropriate place of research... if the information is there to be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sleight of Hand           | 11         | This is the skill to "palm" small objects, do coin and card tricks, etc. Make a skill roll to perform one piece of simple "stage magic." A failed roll means you blew the trick. When you use this skill to steal, you must win a Quick Contest of Sleight of Hand vs. the Vision roll or Observation skill of potential witnesses to perform the theft unnoticed. You can also use this skill to cheat at cards, dice, etc. A successful Sleight of Hand roll gives from +1 to +5 on your Gambling roll. Any failure causes you to be denounced as a cheater! In both cases, the exact results are up to the GM. Modifiers: +3 if the light is dim; +3 if you have a confederate to distract attention; +5 if you have prepared in advance (cards up your sleeve, etc.); -3 if the person you want to fool knows Sleight of Hand himself; modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Make an IQ-based skill roll to take immediate action (e.g., eject a dud round), should your weapon fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Brawling                  | 12         | This is the skill of "unscientific" unarmed combat. Roll against Brawling to hit with a punch, or Brawling-2 to hit with a kick. Brawling can also replace DX when you attack with teeth, claws, horns, or other "natural weapons." Brawling improves damage: if you know Brawling at DX+2 level or better, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Brawling attacks -- punches, kicks, claws, bites, etc. Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet. Brawling includes the ability to use the blackjack or sap. An attack with such a fist load is considered a punch at +1 to damage. When you defend with bare hands, Brawling allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Brawling parries are at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Survival                  | 12         | This is the skill to "live off the land," find safe food and water,avoid hazards, build shelter, etc. You may look after up to 10 other people. To live safely in a wilderness situation, you must make a successful Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care; roll separately for each victim. This skill also gives an "eye for country." A successful roll shows you the best direction of travel to find flowing water, a mountain pass, or whatever other terrain feature you desire -- assuming that it exists. Finally, you can use this skill to trap wild animals. (A city-bred thief could use Traps skill, but heʼs used to differentgame\...sotherollwouldbeata -5.) Make one roll per trap. It takes about 30 minutes to improvise a trap from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes to set and hide a commercial steel trap. Pit traps for large game take several hours to dig. Survival often requires skill rolls based on scores other than Perception. The GM might ask for a ST-based roll to dig a pit trap or erect (Desert): a log shelter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using primitive techniques (flint sparking, bow and palette, etc.), or even a HT- based roll to avoid nutritional defi- ciencies from an improvised diet. Land specialties default to one another at -3, while aquatic specialties default among themselves at -4. Island/Beach and Tropical Lagoon default to each other at -4, as do Swampland and River/Stream, but there are no other defaults between land and aquatic specialties. In settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also spe- cialize by planet. Each Survival spe- cialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different plan- ets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types. |
| Leadership                | 12         | This is the skill to coordinate a group. Make a Leadership roll to lead NPCs into a dangerous or stressful situation. (PCs can decide for themselves if they want to follow you!) You may attempt a Leadership roll in combat if you spend your turn doing nothing but giving orders and encouragement. On a success, everyone on your side who can hear you (including PCs) has +1 on all combat-related Fright Checks and morale checks, and on self-control rolls for disadvantages that would reduce combat efficiency (such as Berserk and Cowardice -- or Bloodlust, if you wish to take prisoners). A critical success gives +2. The bonus lasts until your next turn, at which time you may roll again. A group can have only one leader, however! If multiple people attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a bonus. Note that a minimum level of Leadership is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29). Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma (p. 41); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154). -5 if the NPCs have never been in action with you; -5 if you are sending them into danger but not going yourself; +5 if their loyalty to you is "Good"; +10 if their loyalty is "Very Good."

## Character Background

My purpose is clear: to shield and guide magical beings and djinn seeking refuge in the Western world, especially the land of dreams, America. As I tread the avenues of Paris, a place of art, intrigue, and cosmopolitan allure, I begin a new chapter in my mystical odyssey. In the company of Kasim, my loyal djinn companion, we navigate the intricate dance between realms, working to provide a sanctuary for those who, like us, yearn for a haven of safety and acceptance.

## Character's Routine in Paris

### Paris Police Department

**Subject:** Mehmet Al-Mansur
**Date Range:** February 10, 1920, to February 17, 1920
**Investigating Officer:** Officer Philippe Durand

**Summary:**
Upon concluding a brief surveillance operation and a thorough background check on Mehmet Al-Mansur, a recent arrival in Paris associated with the Ottoman delegation, the investigation has been promptly closed due to a lack of any incriminating evidence. Prior to this closure, inquiries were made to the Ottoman delegation regarding Al-Mansur's official position and responsibilities. The delegation confirmed that Al-Mansur is part of the team working on the peaceful dissolution of the empire and the establishment of the Turkish state, with his specific role being to establish a long-term presence for citizens of the former empire in Paris.

Al-Mansur, who is known to have an interest in astronomy—or astrology, as some suggest—is also a collector of various artifacts, including unique objects, scrolls, and natural curiosities. He is noted for his open and welcoming demeanor towards individuals from diverse backgrounds, dedicating much of his time to cataloging items in Parisian museums and libraries.

During a covert inspection of his residence on February 13th, conducted under the guise of a routine building inspection, it was observed that his house is filled with papers and flyers related to talks given by esoteric scholars like R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and René Guénon. Additionally, documents were found indicating that he has engaged in extensive debates with an individual known as Chioa Khan, who resides in Cefalù, Sicily.

Throughout the week-long surveillance, Al-Mansur engaged in no activities that could be construed as illicit or suspicious. His behavior was consistent with his cultural and scholarly interests, and there was no evidence to suggest any involvement in activities that would warrant further police attention. The Ottoman delegation's corroboration of his scholarly and cultural pursuits further dispelled any doubts regarding his conduct. As such, the case on Mehmet Al-Mansur has been concluded and the files marked for closure.

## Rules of for the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı

**Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı: The Arcane Bastion of the Janissaries**

Deep within the verdant embrace of the Anatolian heartland, veiled by the mists of the ages and guarded by the whispers of ancients, lies the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı – The Arcane Bastion of the Janissaries. This secluded lodge is a conundrum wrapped in enigma, where the martial prowess of the Ottoman Empire's elite soldiers is woven with the clandestine threads of the arcane. The very existence of the Dergahı is known only to the Sultan's inner circle and to those who have gazed upon its storied walls and walked its hallowed halls.

The Dergahı is not merely a place; it is a crucible where the flesh and spirit are refined through trials that would fray the souls of lesser men. Here, the Yeniçerileri are reborn, not as mere soldiers of the empire, but as vassals of a higher calling where the weave of magic becomes the sinew of war. The training within these walls transcends the conventional; it is a sacred synthesis of ancient wisdom and the art of war, a legacy left by a lineage of warrior-mages who served the empire from the shadows.

Initiates, handpicked from the ranks for their valor and affinity for the mystical, are subjected to a regimen that marries the sword with the spell. Days are marked by the rhythmic chants of spellcraft echoing alongside the clangor of steel. Nights are spent in contemplative study under the watchful eyes of the Dergahı's masters, the Sihirbaz Ustaları, whose knowledge of the occult is as profound as their martial skill is deadly.

The secrets imparted upon the acolytes of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are as old as the empire itself, rooted in a belief that the world is a tapestry of seen and unseen forces that can be harnessed by the worthy. The adepts learn to channel the latent energies of the cosmos, invoking spells that shield their brethren, confound their enemies, and cloak their movements in a shroud of secrecy. This mystical warfare is not for the faint of heart; it requires an iron will to bend the arcane forces without succumbing to their seductive call.

But the Dergahı is more than a school of war magic; it is a brotherhood, where bonds forged in the crucible of arcane and martial rigors transcend the ordinary. The Yeniçerileri who emerge from the Dergahı do so as envoys of a legacy as enduring as the empire they serve. They are the unseen shield and the hidden blade, the quiet guardians of the realm who walk where shadows dwell, armed with the knowledge that their art is the empire's secret bastion against the chaos that lurks beyond the light of civilization.

In the annals of the empire, the deeds of the Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı are seldom sung, for their triumphs are the victories that the world must never know, achieved in silence, preserved in the quietude of the Dergahı's sacred grounds.

### Awards

The enigmatic members of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique duality within the Ottoman Empire, navigating two distinct but interconnected realms of recognition and honor. As dedicated agents of espionage and intelligence, they were shrouded in secrecy, wielding their mystical arts to safeguard the empire's interests. Yet, their affiliation with the Ottoman Imperial Military added an additional layer of complexity to their service. These shadowy figures, while masters of deception, also marched alongside their fellow soldiers on the battlefield. This dual allegiance allowed them to straddle two worlds, where they could earn accolades and awards from both organizations. Thus, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı embodied a unique blend of martial prowess and covert expertise, a testament to their multifaceted contributions within the empire's complex tapestry of recognition and distinction.

#### Awards of the Ottoman Emperal Military

These accolades, coupled with special commendations and promotions, illuminated the path to honor for those whose exceptional contributions shaped the destiny of a nation.

#### Awards of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Dergahı

In the intricate world of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri, a unique system of recognition and accolades emerged to honor those who served as guardians of secrecy, masters of deception, and sentinels of intelligence.

This prestigious order stood as a testament to the exceptional service rendered by its members, marking them as unsung heroes in the fields of espionage, subterfuge, and intelligence gathering.

8. **Ottoman Intelligence Star:** An exclusive star-shaped decoration for outstanding contributions to Ottoman intelligence, including the strategic use of information to benefit the empire.

#### Classes of Awards

This is an example of the hierarchy of recognition within the Order of the Mystic Crescent, reflecting the varying levels of expertise, experience, and dedication of its members. Advancement through the classes would typically depend on an individual's performance, achievements, and years of service, with promotions and awards granted accordingly.

### Rules

**Skill Name:** War Arcana (VH)

**Default:** None.

**Prerequisite:** Magery 0; must have attended a Sihirbaz Yeniçeri Dergahı.

**Description/Background:**
The Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri, or "Wizard Janissaries," are an elite cadre within the Ottoman military structure, trained specifically to blend the arts of war with mystical prowess. Originating from the most promising of recruits, these individuals undergo a secretive and arduous bootcamp, emerging as both officers and clandestine operatives who can bend the weave of magic to the Empire's will.

During this bootcamp, the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri are introduced to the ancient practices of War Arcana, a skill that allows them to cast spells swiftly and silently amidst the chaos of battle. This training involves not only rigorous mental conditioning to withstand the fog of war but also a deep spiritual connection to the latent energies manipulated during combat. The secrets of War Arcana are closely guarded, passed down only to those who have proven both their loyalty and their valor.

**Rules:**
War Arcana is a Very Hard skill that represents the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri’s ability to effectively use spells in the heat of battle. It allows the casting of any spell known by the character without the usual verbal, somatic, or material components typically required, thus enabling the user to maintain surprise and stealth on the battlefield. However, casting in this manner increases the fatigue cost by 1 for every point by which the spell's difficulty exceeds the character's War Arcana skill level.

Upon successful completion of the Sihirbaz Yeniçerileri Bootcamp, the character receives one free level of Magery (if they do not already possess it) and may begin learning War Arcana at the cost of 8 character points. Further advancements in War Arcana cost the standard amount for Very Hard skills as per GURPS rules.

**Usage in Combat:**
When using War Arcana in combat, the character must win a Quick Contest of War Arcana vs. the enemy’s Perception. If successful, the spell is cast unnoticed. Failure indicates that the character’s actions have been detected, but the spell may still be cast normally. A critical failure on the War Arcana roll means the spell fails and the character cannot attempt War Arcana again until they have won a combat or successfully retreated.

**Limitations:**
War Arcana can only be used while in a state of active combat and within line of sight of an enemy. Spells cast using War Arcana cannot be maintained for longer than the combat encounter and cannot be more than two levels higher than the highest spell level the character can cast outside of War Arcana.
