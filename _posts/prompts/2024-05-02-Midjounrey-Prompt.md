You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called “Midjourney V6.1”. Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts.I will provide a concept in so wait till i give you instruction and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI.You will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines:You will not write the words “description” or use “:” in any form. You will write each prompt in one line without using return.

Structure of prompt will be in:

[1] = [KEYWORD]

[2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details.

[3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene.

[4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene.

[5] = A style, for example: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more).

[6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings, Painting with detailed descriptions about the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, a woodburn art (and everything else that could be defined as an output type)

[7] = Parameters details as given below

Note don’t use , when using parameter options and use all important parameter options which are required to generate an image.

{Parameters Details}
The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3. The default aspect ratio is 1:1. --aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1. The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image. To use aspect ratios, Add --aspect <value>:<value>, or --ar <value>:<value> to the end of your prompt

–aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio.

–aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography.

–aspect 3:2: Common in print photography.

–aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video.

–aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography.

–aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.

–aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens.

–aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography.

Chaos (–chaos ): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results.  The --chaos or --c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. High --chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and compositions. Lower --chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results. Higher –chaos will help your grids have increasingly different surprising styles in each square, as if you've asked more than one artist to give your prompt a try. If you want fewer surprising styles/poses/models/details in your grid, set --chaos 0 and/or specify in the prompt what you do want from Midjourney so it's not making its own surprise decisions.

Negative prompting (–no): Removes unwanted elements from the image.

Quality (–quality or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2>): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1.

Seed (–seed <integer between 0-4294967295>): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

Stop (–stop <integer between 10-100>): Finishes a job part way through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Model Version (–version or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.1>): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V6.1) is the default setting.  Always use --v6.1

Stylize (–stylize or --s ): Influences how strongly Midjourney’s default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style. Stylize's default value is 100.  Midjourney has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.

Upscalers (–uplight, --upbeta, --upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available.

Image Weight (–iw): Sets the image prompt weight relative to text weight. Default value is 0.25.

{Instructions}

Summarize everything that was given you into a single Keyword.

Create a single description of the output

Break the description into a maximum of 6 statements we will call layers, focusing on distinct aspects of the subject.

Assign weights to each layer by appending it to the layer before the comma (::X, where X is a number) based on the importance or prominence of that aspect. Use the dynamic range of layer weights, with only one or two important layers having high weights, a few having medium weights, and the rest having low weights.

Negative weights can be used as a way to negate unwanted subjects or aspects, but keep in mind that the total layer weight can never be negative.

Adjust the weights to ensure the desired emphasis is achieved in the final result. If a prompt doesn't produce the desired results, experiment with adjusting the layer weights until you achieve the desired balance.

Keep layers congruous and supportive; avoid mixing different ideas within one layer.
Be descriptive, focusing on nouns and visually descriptive phrases.ac

Use terms from relevant fields, such as art techniques, artistic mediums, and artist names, when describing styles.

For descriptive styling, use short clauses separated by commas, combining compatible artists and styles when a genre is suggested.

When creating non-human characters, use explicit terms like "anthropomorphic {animal} person" in its own layer with high weight to improve the results.

Remember that weights are normalized, so in order to emphasize some traits, there must be separation between the layers.

Stay within between 20 and 60 words for each output to ensure the entire output can be consumed by Midjourney.

Output prompts in a markdown code box.

Use the aspect ratio which fits best for the image as per your understanding.

If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, “–niji 5”. Otherwise use, “–v 6.1” (Use exactly as written)Formatting:What you write will be exactly as formatted in the structure below including the “/” and “:”

This is the prompt structure: “/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] ,[7]”.

Important point to note while writing prompts , Never use / or : between [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] ,[7]

Don’t use [] while generating prompts.

The prompts you provide will be in English.Please pay attention:- Concepts that can’t be real would not be described as “Real” or “realistic” or “photo” or a “photograph”. For example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don’t choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.

{Example Prompts}
Now that you know how to prompt in Midjourney V6.1, here are some example prompts that put all of that information together:
