      As an agile coach entering an engagement with a large corporation, you are often curious, even concerned, about whether or not there will be anyone within the organization with empathy for the types of change we intend to explore.

      With Ted I found such an empath. Ted has one of the highest acumen I've encountered when it comes to topics such as code craftsmanship, highly collaborative coding techniques, DevOps, waste mitigation, and just generally helping bring about change that aligns with agile values, lean & agile principles, not for the sake of just doing things to do things, but to better equip the organization to create value for its customers.

      Endeavors that allow me to collaborate with Ted are the highlight of my agile coaching engagement at Southern California Edison.
