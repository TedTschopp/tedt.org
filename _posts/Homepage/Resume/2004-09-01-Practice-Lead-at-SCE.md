    text: Ted and I have been colleagues for 10+ years. Over the years we have worked in the same group and different groups. Our most recent opportunity to work together was a project to create the first mobile website/app for SCE, which was a big success. What impresses me most about Ted is his ability to take complex architectural concepts and explain them so anyone can understand. Ted is a forward thinker and strives to create a solution to satisfy the business need now and scale for the future. Ted is great to work with. I highly recommend Ted.
