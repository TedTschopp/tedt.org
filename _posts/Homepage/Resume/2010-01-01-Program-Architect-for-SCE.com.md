  text: I've worked with Ted on several digital projects at Southern California Edison.
    I find him to be intrinsically curious and his thirst for knowledge drives him
    to always find a better way to deliver product. When Ted provides system design
    and architecture advice and recommendations, you can bank on him thoroughly doing
    his research to come up with a sound conclusion. He's a good business partner
    and collaborator always seeking to do the right thing.

  text: Ted keeps up with more technologies than most of the technologists I have
    worked with, and brought an excellent mix of superior technical skills and great
    teamwork to all his assignments. One of the things that I found most gratifying
    was to see Ted's growth as an architect and technical leader through the significant
    programs he worked on over the years.
