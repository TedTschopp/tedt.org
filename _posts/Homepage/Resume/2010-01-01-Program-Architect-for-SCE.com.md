    text: I've worked with Ted on several digital projects at Southern California Edison. I find him to be intrinsically curious and his thirst for knowledge drives him to always find a better way to deliver product. When Ted provides system design and architecture advice and recommendations, you can bank on him thoroughly doing his research to come up with a sound conclusion. He's a good business partner and collaborator always seeking to do the right thing.

    text: Ted keeps up with more technologies than most of the technologists I have worked with, and brought an excellent mix of superior technical skills and great teamwork to all his assignments. One of the things that I found most gratifying was to see Ted's growth as an architect and technical leader through the significant programs he worked on over the years.
