description: No doubt about it, the brilliant hues that this mutant species of Portugese
  Man-O-War comes in are a warning of extreme danger for anything that crosses it's
  path. Armadas float slowly along coastal rivers and streams, supported about 2-3m
  above the surface by a natural hydrogen balloon, aided by the wind, or pulling themselves
  by their larger, visible tentacles if the air is still.

behavior: It hunts by means of a etheral network of almost invisible stinging filaments
  that float in a 2m radius around the creature's main body, that carry an intensity
  16 Paralytic Poison. Only a faint, silvery shimmer in the air around the Armada
  betray's the filament network's presence. Once a victim is paralysed, the jellyfish
  pulls itself rapidly toward it's prey and attacks with it's deadly main cluster
  of tentacles, that combine an Acid Attack that does 2d6 per round of contact, and
  an Intensity Level 17 Poison. While it mainly targets smaller birds and insects,
  it's more than able to digest prey of any size. Armada's reproduce by budding, and
  most specimens encoun- tered have 1d6 smaller hydrogen pods. These begin life as
  extra support balloons for the tentacle network, and split off to become independent
  adults when they grow large enough. One of the best ways to handle one of these
  creatures is to attempt to nail the hydrogen balloons from a distance, but this
  should be done carefully, because the gas inside has a tendency to explode, blanketing
  a 10m area with loose filaments and tentacles segments, which usually take a couple
  days to lose their potency.
