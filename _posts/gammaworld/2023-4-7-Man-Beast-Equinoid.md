new_description: These vaguely centaur-like creatures are two meters in height and
  live in mountainous regions, using natural or artifical-exacated caverns for shelter.  Equinoids
  have an extremely strong sense of cultural identiy.  Their young are kept isolated
  from all "contamination" by non-Equinoid thought and ideas; any spies or inflitrators
  caught within their caverans are immediately executed.  Except for this protectionists
  attitude regarding their young, Equinoids are generally friendly to other races.

society: Equinoids seek to rebuild an advanced civilization modeled on that of the
  Ancients; they are thus sympathetic to the Restorationsis.
