description: Garrels are agile mam- mals of reasonable intelligence that have developed
  several special skills to foil predators. They are intensely curious beings, and
  they love to collect small pieces of both metal and plastic, espe- cially if they
  are shiny, have strange shapes, or are in some other way attrac- tive to the garrel.
  Because of this, gar- rels often unwittingly have one or two small artifacts in
  their possession, mak- ing them targets for treasure hunters(especially for Archivists).
  However, it is unlikely that the garrels need fear extinction at the hands of such
  as these.When not gathering food, a garrel is always on the lookout for new items
  to add to its collection. Anyone who camps in or near a forest inhabited by garrels
  can expect at least one of these creatures to be lurking nearby, just out of sight.
  The garrel will wait until it sees something attractive thats also unguarded. It
  will then use its teleport object ability to gain possession of the item and will
  then return to its lair, most often a hollow tree trunk or a small burrow, where
  the garrel will put the item with the others it has accumulated.If a garrel is attacked,
  either by a predator or by angry beings whose equipment has been borrowed,' its
  first reaction will be to flee, holding any treasures it has acquired for as long
  as it can, using its speed, agility, tree-climbing skills, and any available foliage
  to speed its escape. Garrels prefer forests with a thick blanket of undergrowth
  so that they can lose pursuit with a minimum of effort. During the chase, the garrel
  will trust its displacement ability to send it to safety if it is at any time in
  imminent danger of being killed.If displacement cannot be used, the garrel will
  then use its stunning force to buy time. Garrels are immune to the effects of another
  garrels stunning force attack. If both of the previous powers have been used and
  the garrel is still in danger, it will then attack its pursuer, biting with its
  sharp teeth and never relenting.
