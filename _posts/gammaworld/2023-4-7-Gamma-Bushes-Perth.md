behavior: These terrestrial birds are heavy and stupid, but fairly fast on their feet
  and able to fly clumsily for short distances. They have acute hearing and are only
  surprised on a 1. When encountered by a known predator, they scatter, each leaving
  behind a cloud of opaque gas 9 m across which blind any character or creature that
  comes in contact with it. Each bird can do this only once every 4 hours, and it
  is indicative of their stupidity that they all release their gas at once whenever
  they are encountered.If a creature or character is not a known predator and approaches
  lukalukas in a peaceable, reassuring manner, roll a reac- tion check  they scatter
  on any result of 9 or less, and must check morale on any roll between 10 and 17.Once
  their gas is used, lukalukas are virtually defenseless when caught. How- ever, due
  to their habit of eating plants with bacterial symbiosis (which does not harm or
  leave any symptomatic marks on the bird), they should be thoroughly cooked before
  eating. If not, there is a 60% chance that any lukaluka is carrying a random plant-carried
  disease.

combat: If the plant is disturbed (handled roughly or damaged in any way), its flower
  begins to glow with cascading light in all the colors of the rainbow, emiting powerful
  radiation.
society: Perth grow in temperate and tropical regions of Gamma Terra. The petals of
  its flower, harvested and sun-dried for three days, can be ground into a powder.
  When ingested, it grants a +2 step bonus on Resolve checks for healing wounds. A
  single perth yields up to 20 doses of the powder.
