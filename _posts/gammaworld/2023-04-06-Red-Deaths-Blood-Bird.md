description: The blood bird, also know as the Red Death is a mutated Scarlet Tanager.  It
  retains the startling red plumage of its unmutated cousin, but is much larger, standing
  nearly a meter tall.  Its serrated beak is a formidable as the spurs on its wings.  On
  the top of its red head, the blood bird carries two long spurs that apparently serve
  no purpose.  Its eyes are exceptionally keen.
