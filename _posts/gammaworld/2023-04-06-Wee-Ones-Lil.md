description: These small winged humanoids are only 20 cm tall.  They are nocturnal
  and their bodies give off enough life to illuminate 1 meter around them.

behavior: Lil build their homes in mazes and brambles.  They are sophisticated enough
  to possess artifacts, but are limited by their size in how they use them.  They
  control their light in the event they need to remain hidden.  In addition to all
  their species specific mutations, Lil will also possess a unique mutation.   Their
  colorization is normal human pigmentations and colors.

new_description: These graceful creatures appear to be diminutive humans with antennae
  and beautiful, fragile wings. They have the same proportions as normal humans, as
  well as the same range of hair and eye color. Their wings are usually like those
  of dragonflies, long and transparent, though some groups have wings like those of
  butterflies of various types. Much like fireflies, lils have a limited ability to
  generate light. When in the dark or in deep shadow, lils periodically and involuntarily
  give off enough light to illuminate everything within one meter. This is not the
  mutation photogeneration, and lils cannot concentrate this light into bursts.
combat: The grace and beauty of these tiny beings hides their incredible roughness
  They will avoid combat as much as possible, preferring to use their vast array of
  mutations to protect themselves and drive opponents away. If forced into close melee
  combat they are essentially helpless. Lils often use tiny bows and arrows which
  do 1 point of damage if they hit successfully, but are dipped in intensity 15 sleep
  poison. This poison functions like paralytic poison, but never goes above Stage
  III. Stage III is "asleep." It lasts an hour.
society: Lils live in village built of mazes of brambles, building small nest-like
  family dwellings. They are very playful and mischievous, playing pranks on one another
  and on outsiders. They prefer to avoid contacts with other intelligent life, though
  they have been known to aid travelers who have not caused them any problems. Lil
  often have artifacts of great sophistication, but their ability to use such items
  is limited by their size. Nonartifact items are always Tech Level I or II.
