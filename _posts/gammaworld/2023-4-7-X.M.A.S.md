description: The X.M.A.S unit was oringnally designed to serve in department stores
  around the world.  The general design became so popular that it wsa manufavtured
  with grav sleigh and robotic servo reindeer.  The unit that landed in New Hope had
  obviously been modified into something different than the original design intended.  It
  will be friendly to all the people of New Hope and give out tous and hte like to
  kids.  It will talk to everyone and ask them what they want and promise to bring
  it the nex year ( a promise that cannot be kept).  If the characters contine to
  attack after it lands, it will be forced to devestate the town, until some mutant
  destroys its power source.The unit is also equipt with Vibro Dagger, a Stun Greande
  Thrower , Laser Pistol, and Laser Rifle.Although it normally operates with hand
  and foot controls, it does have limited audio control capacity and will obey simple
  directional commands. All units, including the laser weapons, are powered by broadcast
  power from the robot factory, giving units a range of 500 kilometers. The S. Reindeer
  will react to any physical attack with the flame thrower in their tails. Their mini-missiles
  are shot on the instructions of the X.M.A.S. unit. If the X.M.A.S. unit is destroyed,
  the X Unit Sleigh and remaining S. Reindeer will return to the factory at maximum
  speed. Although the X.M.A.S. unit is programmed to be jolly, it will not allow itself
  to get into situations where it can be easily destroyed.
