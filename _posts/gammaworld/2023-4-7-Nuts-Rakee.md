behavior: A Rakee can not be killed.  He regenerates completely in one turn, no matter
  how he was destroyed.  Rakee's will bind themselves to the strongest opponent they
  think will have the ability to finally kill them, and once they do get killed they
  will continue to return to this opponent in hopes of making their death last longer.  If
  the opponent doesn't engage after 3d3 attempts they Rakee will find someone else
  to attack and follow. If the opponent does engage, than the Rakee will bind themselves
  to this new master until someone more powerful comes along and impresses the Rakee.
