description: The land cred has a brilliant red flower and lives in temperate areas
  with regular rainfall. surrounding the plant's bulbous flower is a mass of strong,
  leafy vines. The crep can move about (slowly) on its thick, flexible roots, seeking
  better 'hunting grounds'. The crep's vines are mobile and quite dexterous (although
  the plant is largely blind, and not very intelligent).

behavior: The Ba'crolbai can start a charge with a run of 15 feet.  Once every twenty
  four hours it can double its speed for one plus MP modifier hours. Because of its
  speed, it is very, very hard to hit.

society: Crep are found in still freshwater, along shores, and in moist, temperate
  climates. They migrate slowly, killing off local animal life and leaving a 'trail'
  of crep seedlings in their path. Immature crep plants grow rooted for a season before
  gaining mobility and moving off on their own in search of prey.
