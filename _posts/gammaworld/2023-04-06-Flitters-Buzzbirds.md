description: This white tree looks like a banyan and grows to the height of 60m.  The
  narl ep or 'ghost tree' is a mutant form of White Swamp Oak that grows in or near
  slow-moving water. The tree's smooth bark is completely white and its leaves are
  a pale green. During the spring its branches are covered in nut-like seed pods.
equipment: ''
reactions: Buzzbirds may use their speed increase one hour per day, as usual, but
  they may split that hour up into smaller units (as little as one action turn) if
  they so desire. Their light generation has a smaller radius (10 meters) than usual
  and is not direction- al, since it emanates from their bodies rather than their
  eyes.
behavior: They are also peculiarly attracted to the color red, and react at a +2 modifier
  to creatures which are red or primarily clothed in red. They seldom attack anything
  except to defend themselves or their friends.

combat: They seldom attack anything except to defend themselves or their friends.
  The buzzbirds sonic attack does no hit-point damage, but it affects the nervous
  system of creatures so endowed. It hits as a mental attack of MS 7, and does not
  affect unintelligent plants, invertebrates, or deaf creatures. If a creature is
  affected, the GM should roll 1dl0 on the appropriate table.  Affected creatures
  do not recognize friends if an 8, 9, or 10 is rolled on the table. They rarely attack
  the buzzbird, which attacks while flying rapidly past its opponents. The attack
  affects all creatures, friend or foe, within a 5-meter radius, and is +2 to hit
  creatures with better-than-human hearing. Covering ones ears has no effect on this
  attack. The buzzbird can continue this attack nonstop for an indefinite period of
  time. If a creature recovers from one of the effects on the table but is still in
  the area of effect of the buzz, a new attack should be rolled; if the creature is
  affected again, a new 1d10 should be rolled on the table.1 - 3 Creature falls on
  the ground holding its ears for two action turns or for the duration of the buzz,
  whichever is shorter.4 - 5 Creature runs away at top speed for three minutes.6 -
  7 Creature runs around in circles, or otherwise moves rapidly and aimlessly in the
  same area for two action turns or for the duration of the buzz, whichever is longer.8
  - 9 Creature physically attacks the nearest other creature at +2 to hit and double
  damage for two turns or for the buzz duration, which- ever is longer.10 Creature
  attacks the nearest object, as above. If no object is within arms reach, the creature
  may attack the ground (but not itself or its own gear).
