description: 'The aero squid is an amphibious predator, equally formidable in or out
  of water. Its telekinetic flight ability is constant: it essentially swims through
  water and air with ease. An aero squid does not need to return to the water except
  to mate, so it may be encountered over all sorts of terrain in all climates but
  the coldest, as well as in the ocean depths. It has no need to sleep, although it
  will rest after a large meal. The small and completely aquatic infant form of the
  aero squid is exceedingly vulnerable, so the adults are happily rare. A hungry aero
  squid is an eating machine that will devour any form of animal life it can get its
  tentacles on.'

reactions: ''
behavior: Two of its tentacles are very long and end in horny, paddle-shaped appendages
  3 m in diameter. The others are shorter and lined with suction cups. The aero squid
  will bat at creatures on the ground or in the air with the two longer tentacles
  while it grabs other creatures with the other eight. It can use only one tentacle
  per man-sized opponent, but all such targets are considered AC 10 (dexterity and
  size modifiers apply, how- ever). Construction damage does not begin until the action
  turn after a successful grab, and then only affects creatures not in plastic or
  metal armor or a total carapace.Two action turns after the first successful grab,
  it will pull one victim (at random) to its mouth for a bite (at + 4 to hit). It
  will continue to bite one victim until damage equals double the victim's hit-point
  total (i.e., the victim is dead and devoured). After that, it will bite another
  victim, if it has grabbed more than one. Construction damage to a victim does not
  continue while the aero- squid is trying to bite that victim. Creatures weighing
  800 kg or more can try to break free of a constricting tentacle by rolling their
  combined strength and dexterity or less on a doubled percentile. roll. Each character
  may try this only twice (one attempt per action turn).The aero squid is a mollusk
  and has no brain as such, so it is immune to empathy, telepathy, mental control,
  beguiling, confusion, mental blast, and mental paralysis. On the other hand, it
  is stupid, so it can often be avoided by rudimentary camouflage or even simple immobility
  (80% and 30% chance respectively, modified by circumstances as the GM sees fit).
  It will also attack things it can- not eat, such as robots, androids, borgs, and
  vehicles in motion. To hold such an opponent requires one constricting tentacle
  per 50 kph maximum speed of the machine. The aero squid will in any case throw away
  any machine (including a closed vehicle containing living organisms) after one bite.Due
  to its size, an aero squid surprises only on a 1, but it can only be surprised by
  flying creatures (or swimming creatures in the water). Such creatures will surprise
  on a 1-3, since the aero squid's only functional sense is sight.
