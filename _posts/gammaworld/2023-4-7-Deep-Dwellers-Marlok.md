description: Marloks look like Pure Strain Humans, except for their extremely pale
  skin and their large, light-sensitive eyes, both of which are the result of their
  subterranean exist- ence. Why those humans who were the marloks ancestors went underground
  in the first place is not clear, though it is thought they might have been refugees
  from the devastation during the Social Wars, or even command personnel con- trolling
  the war from deep below the earth. No matter what their origins, marloks are one
  of the most successful of the various subterranean races and are widespread, often
  migrating from one underground complex to another by traveling at night on the surface.Marloks
  lead a nomadic life while underground, traveling various tunnels, caverns, and other
  passageways in small, close-knit groups. Because of the large number of subterranean
  preda- tors, they seldom stay in any one place for more than a few days. Marloks
  often use tunnels to the surface to send out nighttime foraging parties to collect
  whatever edible plants and animals they can get. These are used to supplement the
  usual marlok diet of roots and fungi. However, since marloks do not recog- nize
  the rights of surface people, they often are not above raiding a nearby village
  for foodstuffs, though some groups have been able to establish mutual trade arrangements
  in which the marloks receive food for metals and an occasional artifact or two.Marloks
  have developed several powers to aid in underground survival. Their directional
  sense helps individuals to find their way back to their clan if separated, and this
  ability also helps in navigating the maze of underground passageways. Heightened
  precision lets them test the stability of tunnels and caves before entering them.
  Their heightened hearing, besides detecting the approach of enemies, can also detect
  the sounds of settling and potential collapse in tunnel systems. Telekinesis is
  often used to move obstructions from their path; if objects do not prove easily
  movable, molecular disruption can usually reduce them to more manageable size. Should
  the exercise of the former two abilities be beyond the range of any one individual,
  then their mass mind can increase their power output. The marlok racial ability
  of mass mind is better than the type usually encoun- tered, in that the base chance
  of any of the participants dying is only 1% ( + 1% for each minute of contact).
  All involved in the mass mind share a weak tele- pathic link while in contact, between
  those in the link who are touching.
