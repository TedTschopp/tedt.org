behavior: If attacking flying prey, a ka'tal will come from behind , forming a "net"
  with their legs to snatch up the prey. If it is to fast, the ka'tal will use atmokinesis
  to speed up (to 52). Ground targets are attacked with eye rays. If attacked with
  missiles, the 'death will raise a force field and attack the creature who threw
  the missile. If ground prey is weak, the ka'tal will land and bite it to death.Ka'tal
  may be found in groups, but they ignore each other (so a group may last only a day,
  a week or more).
