behavior: in extreme circumstances they have been known to attack humans and mutants
  alike strip-ping the poor victims to the bone of flesh. They do two attacks, a bite
  for 1-2 (1d6/3) points of damage, and can throw 2-5 dagger sized spines 1x per week
  up to a distance of 6 meters. The normally use the spines attacking en masse to
  cut down vegetation and mutated plants. Once a year, in the springtime the Locus
  will swarm to form new hives. During this Hiveswarm time they will be encountered
  in numbers of 80-400 and they will attack anything in their path (To use as food,
  for the new hive).
