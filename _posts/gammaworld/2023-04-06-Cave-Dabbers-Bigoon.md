description: One glance easily identifies a bigoon as a giant, mutated raccoon.The
  creature is well over two meters tall (old males being known to reach three or more
  meters in length, nose to toil). The bigoon's teeth are very much enlarged, and
  it bites for 4 dice (4d6) of damage. The creature also has heightened strength to
  complement its native intelligence and cunning. Despite its increased size and strength,
  the bigoon has lost none of the manipulative dexterity of its small progenitor.
  The hand-sized forepaws of a bigoon are quite nimble and can be used to open simple
  closures and latches.
equipment: ''
reactions: ''
behavior: The bigoon is a nocturnal hunter and has infravisual capabilities. When
  hungry, a bigoon attacks virtually anything, but the creature is prone to ignore
  other creatures if well fed, unless its curiosity is aroused. A well-fed bigoon
  has been known to playfully knock down a passing human in order to tear open a carried
  sack. Fortunately, a blow from a bigoon's forepaw does only one die (d6) of damage.
  A lone bigoon is usually a rogue male. If three or more are encountered, they are
  likely to be a mother and her immature young. Bigoons are all capable of climbing
  trees sturdy enough to hold their weight.
