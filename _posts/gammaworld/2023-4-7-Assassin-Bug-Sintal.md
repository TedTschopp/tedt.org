description: These insects are giant assassin bugs. They are shield shaped with a
  wide thorax, narrowing towards the abdomen, then the abdomen widens (sort of like
  a lopsided hourglass). They have a hooked beak that fits into a slot on the underside
  of the insect. They tend to be green and brown.

behavior: Sin'tal hide up in large trees attempting to make themselves invisible and
  silent to possible prey. When such prey is sighted below the tree, the Sin'tal jumps
  down, making a charge attack with its claws. It next blinds the prey, and attempts
  to bite it to death. Due it its unusual anatomy, the Sin'tal can attack with its
  claws OR bite, but not both in the same round.Sin'tal hunt in small packs in order
  to bring down large prey. They breed in the fall and the egg masses are layed on
  very large trees in the canopy.
