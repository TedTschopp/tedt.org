# Creating Characters

The attributes of a character are given as numerical values which can
change as the game progresses, and characters grow and develop over the
course of their adventures.

## Aspects

All beings have four aspects of their existence. These define the
highest categorical breakdown of a being. They are Physical, Mental,
Social, and Spiritual. They each have a numeric score The higher the
score, the more potential that being has in that aspect of their
existence. These numbers also represent how much damage the character
can take. These aspects can be broken down into your traditional
Characteristics.

| Aspect Name | Aspect Value |
|-------------|--------------|
| Fitness     | (-4 thru 4)  |
| Academic    | (-4 thru 4)  |
| Mystical    | (-4 thru 4)  |
| Emotional   | (-4 thru 4)  |

## Characteristics

All characters have certain basic characteristics that define what they
can do. Each of these characteristics fall into a given aspect. Higher
characteristic scores grant bonuses on task resolution checks, while
lower characteristic scores grant penalties. As part of creating your
character, you decide how strong, smart, and tough your character is by
choosing the appropriate characteristic scores. 

## Knowledge Areas

You acquire knowledge through experience or education. You can acquire
knowledge without applying it. This is what happens when you rely on
your Aspects and Characteristics to get accomplish a task. Overtime you
will acquire enough knowledge to finally develop enough proficiency to
gain a skill in that area. When this is done in a controlled environment
like an educational institution or from an instructor or a tutor, you
gain the knowledge on how these skills apply to your other Aspects and
Characteristics. If, however you have no formal teacher or you are out
discovering something new at the bleeding edge of technical development
for your culture, you only get to apply the Aspects and Characteristics
associated with your skill to the task at hand.

You demonstrate competency, and thus succeeding in your knowledge area
rolls, by applying the necessary knowledge and skill in a real-world
setting where you take full responsibility and accountability for your
actions. The experience gained in this manner distinguishes demonstrated
skill from demonstrated competency.

▩ = Skilled – You are formally trained in this area. Some equipment,
weapons, and actions require professional training to use them.

- If you are attempting something that requires formal skill in an area and you
do not have any, you take a DM-1 to the Characteristic and a DM-1 to the
Aspect in question when rolling the skill.
- If you are formally trained in a skill, you can also use the skill under other aspects and
characteristics.

EXAMPLE: You come across a leather sling. You want to know the religious significance of a religious sling being carried by the guards at your local temple. Your character is physicall very weak, but is an Adept following in the traditions of the Martial Arts Mystic.

- You have a Mystical (Aspect) of 2
- You have a Faith (Characteristic) of 2
- You have a Adept (Knowledge Area) of 2
- You have a Theurgy (Local Religions) of unskilled.
- You have a Fitness (Aspect) of -2
- You have a Muscle (Characteristic) of -1
- You have a Ranged Combat (Knowledge Area) of 1 and you are skilled in it.  

So you roll:
- 2 (Mystical Aspect) + 2 (Faith Characteristic) + 1 (Ranged Combat Knowledge Area) = DM+5 versus
- -2 (Fitness Aspect) + -2 (Muscle Characteristic) + 1 (Ranged Combat Knowledge Areas) = DM-3

You can roll this because you are to get this answer even though you have no formal training in the gods of your religion, which would be Theurgy.


▣ = Competent – You have experiences of being successful at this level.
However, you have not had formal training at this level. You may only
use the Aspects and Characteristics associated with this Knowledge Area
at this level. Remember, some equipment, weapons, and actions require professional training to use them.

▢ = Unskilled - You have no Experience and you are not Skilled. Does not
contribute to Total.

☒ = Damaged - Skilled, but Damaged. Does not contribute to Total.

▩ = Skilled - Skilled. Contributes to Total.

☒ = Damaged - Skilled, but Damaged. Does not contribute to Total.

▣ = Competent - Experienced, but not skilled. Does not contribute to Total.

▢ = Unskilled - You have no Experience and you are not Skilled. Does not contribute to Total.

Each Level in a knowledge area represents a grade level with level 0 being the knowledge the general public gets in this discipline. You are an apprentice or have an associate degree if you have a knowledge are at level 1. You are a journeyman or you have a Bachelor’s degree at level 2. You are a master or you have a master’s degree at level 3. You are a grand master or you have a doctorate degree at level 4. If you are looking for levels above that, at level 5 someone is a principality, power, or demigod. Gods start coming in at level 6.

## Task Resolution

The Märchen Engine allows play players to pick between several different
mechanics to resolve actions. They are as follows: D10, D20, D100, 2d6,
3d6, and 4d7.

Using the Märchen Engine, when you make a die roll to resolve an action
by rolling the chosen set of dice and checking to see what the σ is for
those results. Now add all the Dice Modifiers (⚅) for the given
situation to the σ. This will give you a final number. This is called a
check. You always want to roll high on a check. The symbol of ⥣
represents the number required for a success when you do not need to
determine a σ.

| σ  | 1d20  | 2d6     | 2d8   | 3d6     | 4d7     | 8D4(dreidels) | D100    |
|----|-------|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| -4 | 1-3   | NA      | 2     | 3       | 4       | 8 - 9         | 1       |
| -3 | 4-5   | 2       | 3-4   | 4 – 5   | 5 – 7   | 10 – 11       | 2 – 3   |
| -2 | 6-7   | 3 – 4   | 5-6   | 6 – 7   | 8 – 11  | 12 – 15       | 4 – 18  |
| -1 | 8-10  | 5 – 7   | 7-8   | 8 – 11  | 12 – 16 | 16 – 20       | 19 – 51 |
| ⥣  | 11    | 8       | 9     | 12      | 17      | 21            | 52      |
| 1  | 11-13 | 8 – 9   | 10-11 | 12 – 13 | 17 – 20 | 21 – 24       | 52 – 81 |
| 2  | 14-15 | 10 – 11 | 12-13 | 14 – 15 | 21 – 24 | 25 – 28       | 82 – 96 |
| 3  | 16-17 | 12      | 14-15 | 16 – 17 | 25 – 27 | 29 – 30       | 97 – 99 |
| 4  | 18-20 | NA      | 16    | 18      | 28      | 31 – 32       | 100     |

### Difficulty

A check's Difficulty is a number set by the Referee that modifies your
check result. When no Difficulty is given, the assumed Difficulty is
⚅+0. So, for a task with a Difficulty of ⚅+2, you must add +2 to the
check result. You succeed on a total of the Success Number (⥣) or

In some cases, the consequences of a check vary based on how much the
check result is above or below the target of 8. The difference between
the check result and the target of 8 is called the Effect.

### Effect: Degrees of Effect Defined

There are nine separate ways a predicament can be resolved:

| Degree of Effect | Final σ | ± %  | -0 | \- | \+ | +0 | Final Result |

**Description of Social Sciences:**

Social sciences encompass the study of human society, behavior, and social interactions, often through systematic methods of empirical investigation and analysis.

**Examples of Use in Game:**
Social Science skills can be useful in TTRPGs when the party needs to understand a society quickly to navigate its complexities, when forming alliances, or when trying to alter the course of events within a community. It could also help in interpreting historical texts, solving social dilemmas, or predicting the behavior of NPCs.


**Specializations for Social Sciences:**

1. **Sociology**: The study of social behavior and society structures.
2. **Psychology**: Study of human mind and behavior.
3. **Anthropology**: Study of human societies, past and present.
4. **Political Science**: Study of governmental systems and political behavior.
5. **Economics**: Study of resource distribution and consumption.
6. **Geography**: Study of places and human-environment interaction.
7. **Criminology**: Study of crime, criminal behavior, and law enforcement.
8. **Social Work**: Applied science for improving the human condition.
9. **Communication Studies**: Study of human communication methods.
10. **Linguistics**: Study of language and its structure.
11. **History**: Study of past human events.
12. **Gender Studies**: Exploration of gender roles and equality.
13. **Ethnic Studies**: Study of racial and ethnic groups.
14. **Philosophy**: Examination of fundamental questions about existence.
15. **Religious Studies**: Study of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions.
16. **Human Resource Management**: Study of effective personnel management.
17. **Education Studies**: Study of teaching methods and educational systems.
18. **Cultural Studies**: Analysis of cultural artifacts and practices.
19. **Environmental Studies**: Study of human-environment interactions.
20. **Public Policy**: Study of governmental decisions and their impact.

Your Physical Sciences check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, the weather, and natural cycles as well as perform mathematical operations. You might be asked to make a Survival check to navigate and find a path within a given environment, follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that Beakclaw live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. This skill is also used in urban environments to survive on the streets and to live within that environment.

## Mystical Aspects

### Skepticism Characteristics

In the realm of Skepticism, you will encounter three distinct branches: Arcane, Gnostic, and Chaos.

As a practitioner of Arcane magic, you wield precise and structured spells, relying on the manipulation of mystical symbols and energies. Your skepticism keeps you grounded, approaching magic with a methodical and analytical mindset, seeking to understand its underlying principles and laws.

Moving on to Gnostic magic, you delve deep into esoteric knowledge and hidden truths. You see magic as a path to higher consciousness and self-discovery. Your skepticism here is a tool for discerning genuine wisdom from mere illusions, as you navigate the complexities of mystical realms, seeking illumination and personal growth.

Then comes Chaos magic, where skepticism takes a different turn. Rather than seeking well-defined systems, you embrace the unpredictable and chaotic nature of magic itself. You find power in the fluidity of belief and the ability to shift paradigms, drawing from various traditions and symbols without becoming tied to any one of them. Your skepticism becomes a weapon against dogma, allowing you to remain adaptable and open-minded.

#### Spells of the Skeptic

- **Arcane Dissection:** Analyze and deconstruct complex magical spells or enchantments to understand their underlying mechanisms and weaknesses.
- **Gnostic Insight:** Tap into your higher consciousness to gain profound insights into mystical truths and hidden knowledge.
- **Chaos Infusion:** Harness the power of chaos to enhance unpredictability and adaptability in your spells, confounding opponents and destabilizing magical constructs.
- **Reality Distortion:** Temporarily alter the perception of reality around you, creating illusions that challenge the senses and perceptions of others.
- **Skeptic's Aura:** Create a field of skeptical energy that weakens or nullifies the magical effects of others within its radius.
- **Precision Binding:** Craft intricate magical barriers or bindings with precise geometrical symbols, making them more resilient and challenging to break.
- **Gnostic Resonance:** Establish a psychic connection with other Gnostic practitioners, allowing for the exchange of knowledge and insights.
- **Chaos Merge:** Temporarily blend multiple magical traditions or paradigms, combining their strengths into a potent and unpredictable fusion.
- **Analytical Recall:** Enhance your memory and recall abilities, enabling you to store and access vast amounts of magical knowledge.
- **Skeptic's Disguise:** Conceal your magical presence from others, appearing as a non-magical individual to avoid detection or unwanted attention.
- **Elemental Deciphering:** Analyze and understand the elemental composition of objects or magical phenomena, unraveling their intrinsic properties.
- **Gnostic Empathy:** Develop a heightened understanding of others' emotions and intentions, aiding in negotiations and detecting hidden agendas.
- **Chaos Confluence:** Merge the energies of chaos into your spells, enhancing their versatility and adaptability on the fly.
- **Rational Shielding:** Create magical barriers based on logical principles, making them more resistant to manipulation or exploitation.
- **Skeptic's Rejection:** Nullify the effects of illusions or deceptive magic, seeing through false appearances and revealing the truth.

As a Skepticism practitioner, your spells are fueled by intellectual curiosity, rationality, and the pursuit of understanding. These unique spells reflect your approach to magic, allowing you to question, analyze, and adapt your mystical abilities in unique and intriguing ways.

Shamanism is a profound branch of magic that involves becoming a conduit between the physical and metaphysical realms. As a shaman, you deeply connect with the natural world, recognizing the sacredness of nature and the energies that bind all living beings. Your journey involves mastering rituals and techniques to communicate with spirits, forming relationships with them to harness their powers.

In Shamanism, you enter altered states of consciousness through various methods like meditation, drumming, or dancing. In these trance-like states, you can traverse the ethereal plane to seek guidance, healing, and answers. As you develop your abilities, you become a spiritual leader, offering counsel and mediating conflicts between individuals and spirits.

The practice of Shamanism requires a profound sense of humility and respect for the spirits and the natural world. You embrace the responsibility of maintaining harmony with the ecosystem and fostering reverence for the interconnected web of life. Your role as a shaman is that of a guardian, a healer, and a spiritual guide, guided by the ethereal forces that shape the cosmos.
