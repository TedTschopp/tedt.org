Falling: Falling causes 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen. For every damage die that comes up a 6, the victim breaks a bone. For each broken bone, the character permanently loses 1 point of Strength or Agility (player’s choice). The affected limb, rib, or vertebrae never heals quite right and affects the char- acter in some fashion from then on. | Falling: A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

Barely clearing the ground cover, these stone blocks can make movement difficult. They usually form linear features, with some spread of tumbled masonry.

* Moving through foundations counts as difficult terrain (half move through the foundations). 

#### Flooded pit

#### Low ceilings

The cavern was not formed with Big Folk in mind. 

* All creatures of medium size or larger must crouch, suffering Disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls.

#### Mossy masonry, root-covered wall 

Damp from long years under the canopy of leaves or needles, this ancient stonework is crumbling and water logged, or burdened with the slow creep of mighty roots.

* The hedge provides half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws).

* The tangle of branches can be used to hide.

#### Path, deer track

A path cutting through other obstacles or terrain features offers free movement, but channels creatures in certain directions.

* The path allows normal movement through other obstacles.

#### Pillar

A carved stone pillar stands long after its fellows have fallen.

* Creatures can hide behind a stone pillar.

* Stone pillars offer three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws).

#### Pit

A simple hole in the ground marks where some ancient cellar has collapsed.

For long ages the great black trees in Mirkwood can stand dead, rotting away from the inside. If disturbed they fall, bringing their sodden weight of branches down on any not quick enough to leap aside. 

* If combat comes within 10 feet of a rotten tree, there is a 1 in 6 chance each round that it will fall, showering everyone within a 10-foot radius of the trunk with heavy branches or the trunk itself. Creatures within this radius suffer 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.

#### Scattered rocks, moorland heather, small streams

Uncertain and uneven footing, dense plants that obscure the ground, and small rivulets crossing the scene of a battle can all present challenges.

* These count as difficult terrain (half move through the area).

#### Sloping terrain 

A simple incline to the battlefield provides a tactical consideration as well as making the world feel a bit less like a flat battle map. Whether it’s part of a rolling grassy hill, a tussocked ridge, a stony promontory, a huge cavern with its own landscape, a tight pothole steeply angled into the ground, or upwardly winding passages, a slope might affect the whole battlefield or just a part of it. Different slopes might occur in different directions.

* A shallow slope provides creatures on the higher ground with Advantage on attack rolls.

* A steep slope additionally inflicts Disadvantage on attack rolls to creatures on the lower ground.

#### Sucking bog

A deep slimy expanse of rotted black leaf mould lies over deep, shifting, greasy soil.

Assumes 8 hours of traveling time for overland methods. Waterborne travel can continue longer for man-powered methods (e.g., barges and rowboats) and go overnight for sailing vessels, which is built into the daily distance.

Farmer’s cart is a two-wheeled cart with mule designed for hauling vegetables.
Passenger wagon is a covered wagon designed for carrying paying passengers. Available only between major destinations (e.g., large cities or trading ports).

## Kingdom Scale (6 Mile Per Hex)


## Continent Scale (60 Mile Per Hex)


## Stellar Scale
In Fantasy Role Playing Games it can not always be assumed that there is a Stellar scale.  When at this scale, the goal isn't to provide a map to allow travelers on the surface of the land mass a means of navigation.  Instead it is to provide an overview of what the landmass looks like from space.  



### Flat


### Spherical

#### Distance to the horizon
Based on the following formula. 

$$
d = \sqrt{h\times(2 \times R+h)} 
$$

where 

d = distance to the horizon

h = height of the observer above sea level = 6 feet

R = radius of the Earth = 20,900,000 feet

$$
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{6\times(2 \times 20,900,000+6)}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{6 \times 41,800,006}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{250,800,036}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 15,836.6674525 \text{ feet}
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 15,836.6674525 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1\text{ mile}}{5280\text{ feet}}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 2.99936883569 \text{ miles} 
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
\text{round}(d)= \lceil d-\frac{1}{2} \rceil
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
\text{round}(2.99936883569)= \lceil 2.99936883569-\frac{1}{2} \rceil
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 2.99936883569  \approx 3 \text{ miles} 
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 3 miles = 3 hexs 
\\

# Monsters
One of the aspects of making a sandbox type of role playing game is that many times the monsters that the players run into do not make sense.  These rules are things I am trying to put down to make a computer controlled map generator that can be used to simplify the planning process for people running a game. A lot of this information was inspired and taken from around the web and expanded upon.

## Monster variation
Today in most role playing games monsters are reduced to a handful of stats that do not make them unique.  The first activity that I think is needed for a database of monsters to run into is that these monsters need to have random stats.  Not every player character or human today has the same strength.  The basic idea here is that there is some variation.  Many times this variation is reduced to simplify bookkeeping and that makes sense.  Today however we have rather powerful computers that can work on handing some of that bookkeeping.  Therefore I propose that attributes be replaced with a set of dice.  


### Stats for Exceptional Members of the Encounter

#### Bonuses to stats vs. Bonuses to skill and combat rolls on a given stat

#### Types of exceptional Members

* Leader, Alpha, Commander
* Giant, Monstrous
* Dire, Prehistoric
* Magical, blessed


#### Types of Subnormal Members of the Encounter
* Child, Grunt, Beta, 
* Dwarf, Miniature, Pygmy, Tiny, Teacup, Pixie
* Dire, Prehistoric
* Magical, Cursed


## Close Calls

### Tracks
What sort of tracks do these monsters leave

### Remains
Abandoned lairs, camps, prey or victims

### Markings
What sort of ways do these monsters mark their territory

## Not so Close Calls

### Their Lair 
Perhaps they are social.  Perhaps they are anti-social.  What happens when you meet them in their typical lair. 

### Encountered away from their Lair
Traveling, Hunting, Gathering, Fighting, Trading, Exploring, Patrolling, Scouting?

#### Travel 
Distance they can Travel in one day.  How long will they remain away from their Home. What sort of Travel?

Do they travel by:
* Land
* Air - close to ground
* Air - within ranged combat
* Air - within sight
* Air - Above sight
* Water
* other?

Why are they traveling
* Traveling
* Hunting
* Gathering
* Fighting

### Habitat
What sort of habitat does this creature live and travel in.  

## External Reactions
How do these creatures typically react to others

## How to hunt them
How difficult are these creatures to hunt and what sort of skills and equipment are needed.

## How to cook / eat them
Once they are hunted, how are they cooked.  Are they edible?  Are the poisonousness?  Are they a delicacy?
