The following rules are what I have collected from around the internet for the use of firearms in MCC & DCC.  I will be playtesting these by converting a Gamma World module to MCC. 



## Firearm Terms 

**Firearm Proficiency:** First-time users decrease the die they use to roll their atacks by -1 die to attacks with a firearm and they increase the fumble die by +1. These penalties exists until either the character gains a level or appropriate training is acquired since first using the weapon.  
**Rate of Fire:** Additional shots may be taken, up to the RoF, but each subsequent shot decreases the die they use to roll their atacks by -1 die. A firearm with multiple RoFs may only fire once during the surprise round, but the chance of a critical hit should increase as per the Surprise Attack rule above. Automatic weapons are indicated by an (A).  
**Reload:** Reloading a firearm manually can take up to a minute. If quick loaders or magazines are available, reloading takes one round. Black powder weapons can take up to 3 rounds to reload.  
**Weapon Speed:** Weapon Speed is only a factor for individual initiative rolls during duels (see above) and does not apply to normal combat initiative.

##Hits Do 1 Die of Damage##
Each firearm has its own damage die; typically d8 for handguns and d10 or more for longarms. For a standard attack, a hit does 1 die of damage. Damage is treated just like any other missile or melee attack, and can be healed as normal.

##Firearms Are Fast##
Using a firearm gives a +1 Die bump for initiative. This represents how quickly a gun can be fired.

##Aiming Increases the Attack and Damage Die By One##
As an action, the shooter may take time to aim. This will increase the attack roll by 1 Die on the dice chain and hits will increase the damage by an additional die (as opposed to a die bump)!

##Taking Cover, When Available, is a Move and Gives a Bonus to AC##
Taking cover is key to surviving a gun fight. If a target is actively hiding behind hard cover, no attacks can be made. If the target is firing back from behind some hard cover, the cover provides a+4 to AC. Firing from a firing port, murder hole or arrow slit can provide up to+8 points of AC.

##Automatic Weapons do 3 Dice of Damage##
Weapons with a RoF that indicates an (A), instead of separate attacks, automatic weapons can affect multiple targets in a 10-foot square area. An automatic fire attack uses 10 rounds of ammunition. The attacker makes a single attack roll that’s compared to the AC of each target in the area. A hit causes 3 dice worth of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half. A critical hit (natural 20) does 6 dice of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half.


Critial Table

Kickback sends the weapon flying. You inflict half damage (rounded down) and are disarmed.
The bullet goes cleanly through the target’s shoulder for an additional +1 d4 damage.
The shot grazes the opponent’s head. Inflict +1 d3 damage and the opponent loses next action.
The target takes a bullet in the abdomen. Add +1 d6 damage and the opponent loses an action on his next round.
The target is shot in the rib cage. Bone fragments splinter off internally, dangerously close to vital organs. Inflict +3d4 damage.
The target takes a bullet in the shoulder and drops his weapon. Add +1 d4 to the damage and the target is disarmed.
The target takes a bullet in the chest and is staggered. The target takes +1 d6 damage and has movement reduced by half and loses one action per round until the end of combat.
The target takes a bullet in the leg. Add +1 d6 damage and the target takes a -5’ penalty to movement until healed.
The target dodges a headshot only to have his ear blown off. Add +1 d6 damage and the target takes 1 d3 damage to Personality.
The target is shot in chest. Add +2d6 to damage.
Gut shot. Unless the target receives medical treatment, he will die in 1 d6 hours. The target takes a bullet in the leg, blasting apart his femur. Add +2d6 damage and the target takes a -1 0’ penalty to movement until healed.
Bullet punctures the target’s lung. Add +2d1 0 damage.
The target is shot in the face. His jaw is dislocated. Add +1 d1 0 damage and the target takes 1 d4 Personality damage.
Bullet blasts the target’s primary attack hand. The target has a -4 penalty to all future attacks.
Force of bullet knocks the target to the ground. Add +2d6 damage and the target falls prone.
A bullet gets lodged in the spinal column. Add +1 d6 damage. The target loses next action, suffers a -2 penalty to AC and a -1 0’ penalty to movement until healed.
The target takes a bullet in the head. Add +1 d6 damage and the target takes 1 d4 points of permanent Intelligence and Personality damage.
Bullet blasts through the target’s chest, shooting bloody chunks from the exit wound in his back. Add +2d6 damage and the target must make a DC 1 3 + PC level Fort save or die.
The target takes a bullet to the groin. Add +2d6 damage and the target must make a Fort save (1 0 + PC level) or lose consciousness and fall to the ground.
The target’s spinal column is blown apart. Add +3d6 damage and the target must make a Fort save (DC 1 5 + PC level) or become paralyzed.
Blood gushes out of the target as the bullet severs a major artery. The target takes +2d6 damage and must make a Fort save (DC 1 3 + PC level) or die in 1 d4 rounds. The target takes a bullet to the throat. Add +2d6 damage and the target must make a DC 1 0 Fortitude save or die.
The target takes bullet in the eye. Add +3d6 damage and the target must make a DC 1 0 Fortitude save or die. The target is blind in one eye.
The target takes a bullet in the chest and coughs up blood. Add +3d6 damage and the target must make a DC 1 5 Fortitude save or die.


Fumble
Your shot misses everything by a good ten yards.
Black-powder Firearms: You are in such a hurry that you leave your ramrod in the firearm. There is a 50% chance that the ramrod skewers your target, doing +2d6 additional damage, or does 2d6 damage to a randomly determined adjacent combatant (even an ally). The firearm cannot be reloaded until you get another ramrod.
For all other Firearms: Magic Bullet: The bullet ricochets wildly off multiple surfaces in the environment -- trees, cavern walls, dungeon walls, the ground -- everyone in the scene must make a DC 5 + your level Reflex save or take 1 d4 damage, including you.
The weapon alarms you almost as much as your target. Make a DC 1 0 Reflex save or drop the firearm.
The kickback from the firearm causes you to lose hold of the weapon. You take a -2 to your next attack as you struggle to regain your grip.
A bad round explodes in the chamber! The firearm isn’t much use at the moment. You can try to get it working again with about 1 0 minutes of effort spent towards repairs.
This round is a dud. You lose your turn reloading the firearm or rotating the cylinder to remove the dud.
The kickback from the firearm sends the weapon flying. You drop it and are disarmed.
The weapon fires a bit too close to your ear canal, making your ears ring loudly. The next enemy that attacks you gets a +2 on his Attack Roll.
The firearm discharges smoke that burns your eyes. You take a -4 to your next attack roll.
The bullet ricochets and hits an ally. Roll damage for one randomly chosen ally.
You leave your finger on the trigger and discharge the firearm into the air before the attack. Take 1 d3 points of damage as a bird, squirrel, bat, or rock from the ceiling falls on your head. Roll a DC 1 3 Agility check or fall prone as well.
The weapon explodes in your hand. You take 1 d4 points of damage from powder burns and the weapon is rendered useless. It would take a gunsmith a week or so to fix it. Additionally, you are at -2 to Attack Rolls with the hand that was holding the weapon until you have healed.
You have difficulty maintaining hold of the weapon and it falls the ground. The fall causes the firearm to discharge and you take the brunt of the attack. Roll damage.
The firearm fails to discharge and you do what you should never ever do. You look down the barrel to see what happened. The firearm discharges after you shake the weapon with the weapon pointed straight at your face. Roll under your current Luck score with a d20 or take 30 points of damage
