# Character Status
As characters have adventures, they will gain experience and fame. These are expressed in the game as STATUS POINTS, which are converted into in- creased RANK. Rank is a measure of how the character's bearing and reputa- tion affect the reactions of NPC's in different situations.

## How To Gain Status Points
Characters begin the game with no Sta- tus Points. At the end of each complete adventure, the GM awards each PC a number of Status Points to reflect how well the character did in the adventure. Status Points are given for the following reasons:
1. BEATING NPC'S IN COMBAT: When a party wins a combat, the GM awards each surviving party member a number of Status Points equal to the Hit Point Score of all opponents divided by the number of party members present when the combat began.
EXAMPLE: A party of 4 attacks 3 His- sers with Hit Point Scores of 40, 36 and 44. The total Hit Point Scores of the Hissers equal 120 (40+36+44=120). This number is divided by the number of characters in the party for a result of 30 (1204-4=30). If the party wins, the survivors each get 30 Status Points.
Winning a combat is defined as beating the other party by killing, subduing or driv- ing away all of the enemy NPC's.
2. GIVING ARTIFACTS TO THE COMMUNITY: A character may turn over to the political or social organization of which he is a member any artifacts he gains on an adventure (as a result of gifts or division of the spoils). The character then gets anumber ofStatus Points equal to the Status Point Value of the item turned over. The Status Point Value of all artifacts is listed in the Equipment Tables in PART IX. The GM must deter- mine the Status Point Value of all other artifacts (using the values given for arti- facts described in the rules as a guide- line). Only functional, powered artifacts that have been figured out by the charac- ter may be turned in for Status Points. An artifact requiring ammunition may be turned in only if the proper ammunition is turned in with it.
3. ACCOMPLISHING A MISSION: If the GM assigns the party a mission (res- cuing hostages, as in the Rite Of Pas- sage adventure, for example), they should be rewarded for accomplishing all or part of the mission. In general, the GM should make awards of 300 to 600 Status Points per character per mission.
4. SPECIAL AWARDS: The GM should reward excellent play or the performance of difficult tasks with Status Point Awards averaging between 200 and 500 points per task per player. Mounting a rear guard against overwhelming odds, beat- ing an especially tough band of NPC's or figuring out some mysterious event are examples ofevents deserving special awards.
All awards are cumulative and should be announced at the end of each adventure (EXCEPTION: Awards for turning over artifacts are made when the artifact is actually turned over). All awards are re- corded in the Status Points Box of the Character Sheet of the PC receiving the award.

## How to Use Status Points

Status Points are used to gain Rank. All beginning characters are Rank 0. This is the lowest Rank in the game. Once a PC successfully completes his rite of passage, he automatically rises to Rank 1. Any further Rank increase is based on the accumulation of Status Points. As soon as a Rank 1 character accumulates 3000 Status Points, he automatically rises to Rank 2. The 3000 Status Points in his Status Points Box are erased (leav- ing any excess points above 3000 in the box). In order to rise from Rank 2 to Rank 3, the character must accumulate twice the number of Status Points it took him to reach Rank 1 (6000). As soon as the character has 6000 Status Points recorded in his Status Point Box, he becomes a Rank 3 character and the 6000 points are erased. The cost to rise 1 Rank continues to double until Rank 6. Characters at Rank 6 and above rise 1 Rank for each increment of 50000 Status Points accumulated. Status Points expended to rise in Rank are permanently removed. There is no limit to how high a character can rise in Rank.

* Rank 0 - Starting
* Rank 1 - Rights of Passage
* Rank 2 - 3,000 Status Points
* Rank 3 - 6,000 additional Status Points
* Rank 4 - 12,000 additional Status Points
* Rank 5 - 24,000 additional Status Points
* Rank 6 - 48,000 additional Status Points
* Rank 7+ - 50,000 additional Status Points

## Rank Affects

Rank has the following effects on play:

1. A character's Charisma is always modified by the addition of his Rank. Thus, a character with a Charisma of 12 and a Rank of 4 would have a modified Charisma of 16 (12+4=16). There is no limit to how high Charisma can be raised by Rank.
2. A character's chances of finding a particular functioning item of equipment for sale at a given Base are increased by 2% per Rank. Thus, a Rank 1 character trying to purchase a piece of Tech Level II equipment at a Tech Level I Base (15% base chance) would have a 17% chance of finding the item. A Rank 3 character would have a 21% chance. The chance of finding an item at a Base is never in- creased by more than 20 as a result of Rank.
3. A character can borrow equipment from his community within the limits of his Rank. In order to borrow equipment, he must be at one of that community's Bases. Thus, a member of Clan Cambol could only borrow equipment at a Cambol Base. The value of the equipment borrowed at any one time may not exceed 100 x the character's Rank in gold pieces. Any items which are depleted (Drugs, Grenades, etc.) or which are lost or damaged by the character must be paid for by him before he can borrow any more equipment from his community. Only equipment of the same (or lower) Tech Level as the Base the character currently occupies may be borrowed. Thus, only Tech Levels I and II equipment can be borrowed from a Tech Level II Base.
4. The die roll used to determine if a party gains a piece of knowledge they are researching is modified by the subtraction of 2 for each Rank attained by the highest Ranked character involved in the research.
5. Characters of Rank 3 or higher may elect to join a Cryptic Alliance. A character may try once per month per Rank above 3 to join a Cryptic Alliance. Thus, a Rank 4 character could try twice to join a particular Cryptic Alliance in a given month. For each such attempt, the GM rolls d% and consults the description in PART IV of the Cryptic Alliance being joined. The Type section of each Cryptic Alliance description includes a percen- tage chance for each character type that the Cryptic Alliance will accept a charac- ter of that type as a member. If the per- centage dice roll for the character's attempt at joining the Cryptic Alliance is less than o r equal t o the percentage chance given in this section for his char- acter type, the character is immediately accepted into membership. If not, the character may try again if he has suffi- cient Rank. If he does not have sufficient Rank, he must wait one month (30 days) before trying again. A character may try to join only one Cryptic Alliance in a 3- month period. If he is turned down by one Cryptic Alliance during that period, he must wait at least 3 months before apply- ing for membership in another Cryptic Alliance. Immediately upon joining a Cryp- tic Alliance, a character treats that Cryptic Alliance as the community of which he is a member. He may no longer be considered a member of his former community.

## Communities and Cryptic Alliances
In general, a character cannot change the community of which he is a member except by joining a Cryptic Alliance. In some isolated instances, the GM may wish to allow a character to join a new community if his own is destroyed, but this should be the exception .. . not the
rule. A character may only be a member of one community or Cryptic Alliance at a time. Once a character joins a Cryptic Alliance, he may not change the Cryptic Alliance of which he is a member. He may be ejected from membership in the Cryp- tic Alliance (or from some other type of community or group) at the GM's discre- tion if he fails to live up to the ideals of the group. Any character who is ejected from his community or Cryptic Alliance be- comes a WANDERER (an outcast, con- sidered fair game in the post-holocaust world). Wanderers are not able to borrow equipment since they have no commun- ity. They may not gain Status Points for turning over artifacts. A character loses all benefits specific to membership in his Cryptic Alliance as soon as he becomes a wanderer.
Characters who are members of a Cryp- tic Alliance, Clan or other social grouping with more than one settlement or dwel- ling place may turn in artifacts, borrow equipment and seek free shelter (for 1 night per Rank) in any of the settlements of the group. He is not limited to using only the Base where he lives.
Membership inaspecific Cryptic Alli- ance carries the following benefits and penalties:
ARCHIVISTS: Members may turn in artifacts for Status Points even if the artifacts aren't functional or powered or if they have yet to be figured out. Members receive double the normal number of Sta- tus Points for turning in any kind of Robot and receive 50 Status Points per item for turning in any artifact which does not have any other Status Point value at- tached to it (e.g. members get 50 Status Points for turning in any junk they don't know what to do with).
BROTHERHOOD OF THOUGHT:
Members receive the same number of points for successfully negotiating with NPC's (e.g. avoiding conflict) that they would receive for beating the NPC's. In addition, for each character a member recruits into the organization, he receives 100 Status Points times the recruit's Rank.
FOLLOWERS OF THE VOICE: Members modify their Charisma by twice their Rank (not simply by adding their Rank) when interacting with Borgs, Think Tanks and Cybernetic Installations. Inaddition, they add their Rank to their die when attempting to figure out an artifact.
FRIENDS OF ENTROPY: Members receive double Status Points for beating NPC's and triple Status Points for des- troying Robots. In general, Red Death Bases consist of Tech Level II nomadic camps and only Tech Level I and II equip- ment may be borrowed at them.

HEALERS: Members receive no Status Points for beating NPC's. However, they get 1 Status Point for each Hit Point recovered by a patient under their care. A Healer may care for a number of individu- als in one day equal to his Rank. Char- acters may be under the care of only one Healer per day. Whenever a character is under a Healer's care, he adds 3 x the the Healer's Rank to the chance of recover- ing from illness at the end of each day. In addition, characters under a Healer's care recover double the normal number of Hit Points that would be recovered by Resting. Healers add their Rank to their die roll when trying to figure out a medical artifact. They get double Status Points for turning in medical artifacts.
KNIGHTS OF GENETIC PURITY:
Members get double Status Points for beating an NPC party containing one or more Humanoids. They lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time their party negotiates with an NPC party that includes one or more Humanoids.
RADIOACTIVISTS: Members receive 25 Status Points for each Radiation Check they must make. They get 300 Status Points for each non-defect muta- tion arising out of a Radiation Check and lose 300 Status Points from those they currently have available for each Defect they gain from a Radiation Check. In addi- tion, members receive five times the normal Status Points for turning in a Mutation Bomb or Genetic Booster.
RESTORATIONISTS: Members get double Status Points for turning in arti- facts or beating NPC parties that include members of the Friends of Entropy, Followers of the Voice, Archivists, Seekers, Zoopremists or The Created
SEEKERS: Members get no Status Points for turning in artifacts and lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time they get an arti- fact as part of their share of the party's loot and don't destroy it. They get 100 Status Points times the recruit's Rank for recruiting a character into their organization and get double the normal Status Points for beating a party that includes one or more members of the Restorationists, Knights of Genetic Purity, The Iron Society, Zooprem- isists, Followers of the Voice, Archivists, and The Created. In addi- tion, they get triple Status Points for destroying Robots.
THE CREATED: PC's cannot be members of this organization.
THE IRON SOCIETY: Members get double Status Points for beating parties which include one or more Pure Strain Humans and lose 50 Status Points from those they currently have available each time their party negotiates with an NPC party containing one or more Pure Strain Humans.
THE RANKS OF THE FIT: Members get 200 Status Points times the Rank of the recruit for each character they recruit into this organization. They get double Status Points for each weapon artifact they turn in.
ZOOPREMISISTS: Members get dou- ble Status Points for beating a party that includes one or more Pure Strain Humans or Humanoids. If an NPC party includes one or more members of The Ranks of the Fit, triple Status Points are received. If both situations apply, triple Status Points (only) are received.
When modified Status Points are received for beating or negotiating with NPC's, the Status Point award for the PC's party is calculated normally. Then the award actually given to the PC is modified. The modifications applying to a particular PC's Status never affect the number of Sta- tus Points awarded to his companions.
