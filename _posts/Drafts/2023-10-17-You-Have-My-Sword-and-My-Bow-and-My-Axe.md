# Introduction

In the expansive universe of tabletop role-playing games, your choice of weapon is more than a mere instrument of destruction; it's a narrative tool, an extension of your character's personality, history, and aspirations. Whether it's a rustic blade handed down through generations or a state-of-the-art laser cannon with cosmic capabilities, each weapon carries its own set of features, mechanics, and lore that can profoundly impact how your character interacts with the game world. 

This exhaustive guide aims to be your definitive resource for understanding those complex intricacies. Covering every conceivable weapon property and classification from the simplest melee instruments to sophisticated cosmic weaponry, this compendium is tailored to cater to both newcomers and seasoned veterans of tabletop gaming. Whether you're a player seeking to optimize your character build or a game master aiming to design balanced and engaging combat scenarios, this guide is your go-to resource. Dive deep into weapon attributes, material compositions, damage types, and many more categories that add layers of strategy and storytelling to your gaming experience.

It's important to note that this guide is very much a work in progress, a living document that continues to evolve. The content is culled from an extensive range of rules, documents, and materials I've written over the years, each contributing to the rich tapestry of information presented here. From various homebrew rules to meticulously researched data, this compilation aims to create a harmonious blend of different systems and philosophies. Your feedback and contributions are not just welcome but highly encouraged, as the goal is to make this a collaborative and comprehensive resource for the entire gaming community.

# Range Weapons

## Thrown Weapons

These are weapons designed to be thrown with one hand, offering a versatile approach to combat.

- **Primary Attribute for Attack Rolls**: Thrown weapons the Muscle Characteristic to determine range.
- **Alternate Attribute for Melee-Capable Weapons**: If the thrown weapon can also be used in melee and does not have the Finesse quality, players have the option to use the character Fitness (minimum of 1) attribute for damage.
- **Specialization and Skill Use**: If a character has a a skill in Ranged Combat, with a focus on throwing weapons, or Athletics with a specialization in throwing objects, this can be used in place of the Muscle Score to determine Range.

## Missile Weapons

These weapons are designed to be thrown or fired, suitable for combat at distances greater than 5 feet. A weapon in this category has the following traits:

- **Ranged Combat**: Effective at distances greater than 5 feet.
  
### Ammunition

- With each attack, you must spend one (or more) pieces of ammunition.  -- Change rule to roll the dice associated with the ammo
- Some ammunition can be used as an improvised weapon.
- Reloading ammunition requires two hands, even if the weapon itself can be fired with one.
- You typically recover half of your ammunition spent after a battle. (No ammunition is recovered from firearms or energy weapons).
- In the Weapon Stats List, damage listed for variant ammunition modifies the damage given for standard ammunition.

#### Running Out of Ammunition

- Six-shooters run out of ammunition on a failed roll that includes any 1's showing on the dice.
- Many-shot weapons run out or overheat on a failed roll that includes two or more 1's showing on the dice.

**Special Cases:**

1. If you roll a 1 on an ability dice (or equivalent), treat it as a critical failure, which may include running out of ammo or overheating, depending on the GM's discretion.
2. If you roll a 2 on an attack roll, your weapon runs out or overheats, unless a 1 is also showing, in which case refer to the special case #1.

### Range

| Märchen Range Category   | Description                               | Traditional Range category | Distance in meters      | Distance in feet       | Distance in 'squares'/inches minis scale | Other                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I can touch it           | Immediate physical interaction            | Close Range                | up to about 2 meters    | up to about 5 feet.    | 1 square                                 | (Also referred to as adjacent or immediate)                                                                |
| I can reach it           | Quick movement or extended reach          | Near Range                 | up to about 10 meters   | up to about 30 feet    | 6 squares                                | (Typical movement rate for many games)                                                                     |
| I can catch it           | Sprinting to get to a stationary object   | Short Range                | up to about 20 meters   | up to about 60 feet    | 12 squares                               | (A typical double move action or run movement)                                                             |
| I can hit it with a rock | Distance for throwing objects             | Medium Range               | up to about 40 meters   | up to about 120 feet   | 24 squares                               | (Typical long range weapon attack)                                                                         |
| I can see it             | Clear visibility, but too far to interact | Long Range                 | up to about 100 meters  | up to about 300 feet   | 60 squares                               | (A typical long range spell attack or high tech weapon)                                                    |
| I can hear it            | Audible but too far for visual contact    | Extreme                    | up to about 1 kilometer | up to about 3,000 feet | 600 squares                              | (Basically anything beyond Long range, within eyesight, and reasonable distance for the given weapon used) |

**Range Categories and Penalties**  
Weapons have specified ranges, divided into categories as above. Each category has associated modifiers for attack rolls. Attacks can be made beyond the weapons stated range, increase the difficulty. The following traits apply:

- **Standard Range**: Attacks made within the weapon's specified range face no penalties.

- **Beyond Range**:
  - For every additional range category beyond the initial one, impose a -2 penalty to the attack roll.
  - You may attempt an attack one range category beyond the listed maximum, but the attack roll suffers a -3 penalty.

- **Close Quarters**:
  - Attacking with a ranged weapon while a threatening enemy is within close range (5 feet or less) imposes a disadvantage penalty on your attack roll.
  - If you are engaged in melee combat and attempt a ranged attack, suffer a -3 penalty.

### Loading (#)

This property applies to slow-loading weapons like crossbows, black powder firearms, and siege weapons.

1. **Rate of Fire**: You can only fire one piece of ammunition or make a single attack with this weapon per round, irrespective of the number of attacks or actions you have available.
2. **Two-Handed Loading**: It requires both hands to load the weapon, leaving you unable to use other weapons or items while loading.
3. **Loading Time**: The symbol "#" represents the number of actions required to reload the weapon. For instance, Loading (2) means it takes two actions to reload the weapon.
4. **Teamwork**:  For weapons that have enough space to work around that require extensive loading time, multiple characters can contribute actions to speed up the reloading process. Each contributing character must also use both hands to assist in the loading. And each character takes up space around the weapon itself.
5. **Restrictions**:  Firing and reloading this weapon takes precedence over any multi-attack features or abilities you may have. The Loading (#) property restricts you to single attacks per round even if your character normally can attack more frequently.

### Reload (# shots, time)

This property is for weapons that have a limited ammunition capacity and must be reloaded after expended shots. Unlike weapons with the "Loading (#)" property, these can be fired every round.

1. **Rate of Fire**:  You can fire this weapon every round, assuming it has ammunition remaining. The number represented by "#" indicates the maximum number of shots you can fire before needing to reload.
2. **Two-Handed Reloading**: Reloading this weapon requires both hands, restricting you from using other items or weapons during the reload action.
3. **Reload Time**:  The second number in the parenthesis indicates the time it takes to reload the weapon.
4. **Ammo Count**: Keep track of the number of shots fired. Once you've reached the limit indicated by "#," you must take the required action to reload the weapon before it can be used again.
5. **Restrictions**: While reloading, you cannot perform other actions that require your hands, like casting spells or using another weapon.

### Auto-Fire

For modern and futuristic weapons that can unleash a hail of rounds in seconds. Most automatic weapons can also fire normal single shots. Auto-fire only weapons often have the Brace quality too. There are basically three ways to use auto-fire:

- All auto-fire attacks are ranged attack actions made at a -2 penalty.

1. **Single Target Burst**: Maximum range is Short for this attack.
2. **Area Burst**: Affects all targets that are Close to each other (typically a 2 x 2 square). Maximum range is Long for this attack.
3. **Sweep**: Starting at one target and if possible moving to others. Maximum range is Long for this attack.

- All uses consume ammunition of 10, (or run out on the numbers rolled listed below if not tracking ammo). -- Fix this

### Double-Shot

This property is for firearms that can fire a couple of shots quickly, such as revolvers and semi-automatic weapons that are not fully automatic. In a Western setting, this is known as Double-Tap.

- **Ammunition**: Using Double-Shot doubles the amount of normal ammunition needed. If using optional rules for rolling ammunition, it increases the chance of running out by 1 step.
- **Movement Penalty**: If you move during the same round that you use Double-Shot, you suffer penalties to your attack rolls as specified below.
- **General**: You can make a Double-Shot as a free action immediately after shooting at a target, to roll a second attack against the same target. If you hit with the second roll, the target takes normal weapon damage. The damage from this second attack is not modified in any way—it is only the damage value listed for the weapon.
- **Movement Penalties**: Moving incurs a -2 penalty to both attacks.

#### Rules missing that are needed

- Ammo that can not be collected after a battle
- Ammo that can be collected and repackaged (brass shells)
- Ammo that can be used as an improvised weapon

### Spray

This property is for weapons spreads out, increasing the chances of hitting. Often referred to as Grape weapons/shot.

- **Close Range**: When attacking a target within what is considered "normal" or "close" range for this weapon, players receive a special bonus of a flat +2 to the attack roll.
- **Beyond Close Range**: When attacking a target beyond this range, the weapon deals half damage. However, the player may choose two targets that are in close proximity to each other to attack simultaneously. The bonus gained at close range does not apply here, but the attack still benefits from the multiple target effect.

### Flight Path

**Round Flight Path**
This property applies to specific thrown weapons, denoting a circular flight path for the projectile.

1. **Determining Flight Path**: Establish a circular flight path with the attacker and target on opposite sides of the circle. The distance between them also sets the 'width' of the flight path.
2. **Intervening Targets**:  If other creatures or solid objects lie along the flight path, they become the new target.
3. **Hit or Miss**: On a hit, the weapon lands in the target's space as usual.  On a miss, the weapon continues along the flight path if it is clear; otherwise, it targets the next creature or object in the flight path.
4. **Weapon Return**: If no targets are hit, the weapon returns to the attacker, who can spend a fast/bonus action to catch it. Otherwise, it lands within Close range of the thrower.
5. **Missed Landings**: Subtract the attacker's attack bonus from the natural roll made for the attack. The result is the number of Close range increments away the weapon lands from the thrower. If the result is zero or less, the weapon returns as described in point 4.

### Scope -- Merged from Source 2

The weapon has been fitted with vision- enhancing sights, allowing it to put shots on target from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically Extreme Range, so long as the character aims before shooting.

### Area (Radius)

These weapons target everyone in the designated radius.

- Size of the area determined by weapon.
- All targets must be withing this range of all other targets.
- Quite often a save/check can reduce the damage of area attacks.
- Area attacks typically deal damage even on a miss or if targets make a successful check/save.

## Blast (X) - Merged from Source 2

This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon’s Blast score in metres. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon, but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.

# Melee Weapons Overview

## Melee Weapons

These weapons are specifically designed for close quarters combat. A weapon of this category has the following traits:

- **Close Quarters**: Melee weapons are effective within a 5-foot range or less.

## Armor Penetration - AP (#)

- This property is for types of weapons that slip through cracks in armor or can pound straight through a simple suit of armor.
- This value does not apply against heavily armored vehicles or heavy cover (unless the weapon also has the Anti-Vehicle property).
- The AP value is subtracted from the Armor Rating of the defender, if applicable.

## Awkward (#)

Apply this property to large tools and improvised weapons, especially those that have more than one part that can cause damage, or to weapons that have several moving parts.

- A critical fumble or equivalent negative outcome occurs when you roll a number represented by "#" or lower on the attack roll or relevant ability die.
- If you roll "#" or lower on your Ability die, reroll the die. If you roll this value again, then it is a critical miss.
- Reduce the required number of 1's by "#". For example, if typically two 1's are required for a crit fumble, a weapon with "Awkward 1" would crit fumble with any 1's showing.

## Barbed

Weapons with barbs and back-ward-facing spikes designed to stick into a target (like a harpoon).

- Weapons with this property do their normal damage when they hit.
- Weapons with this property remain attached to the target on a hit.
- Weapons with this property can be removed by the target, or a creature within Close range of them, by taking an action to remove the weapon with an Average skill check. On a successful result the barbed weapon is removed without damaging the target. On a failure, it is still removed, but the target takes damage again from weapon upon removal.
- If the attacker still wields the weapon, they can also remove it as an action. The attacker can chose if the removal will cause additional damage on removal from the target.

## Brace - Merged from Source 2

Bracing against the ground doubles damage against charging enemies.

## Bulky

This property is for high-powered weapons that require extra support to wield effectively.

- If this weapon is used standing up without a harness, stand or something else to brace with, then you suffer a -2 to your ranged combat skill.
- Bulky items count for two encumbrance slots.

## Brutal - Merged from Source 2

- If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Critical Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is doubled.
- If the result of the attack roll with this weapon is a Serendipitious Sucess, the subsequent damage dealt by the weapon is tripled.

## Charge (XX) - Merged from Source 2

When moving at least XX’ in a Ounces (⏱) and attacking doubles any damage done with a successful hit.

## Crit (#) - Skipped needs to look at

**At this stage this value only applies to Coriolis games; though I would introduce it to Mutant: Year Zero too, as it is even deadlier**.  
Where # equals the amount of extra 6's required to deal a critical hit following a successful attack.

## Crushing - Merged from Source 2

On a critical hit vs. a target of the attacker’s size or smaller, the attacker can choose to either a) disarm the target, or b) halve the target’s movement rate.

Certainly, creating rules for damage-over-time effects like Radiation and Fire can add depth and complexity to combat scenarios. Here's an attempt to create a unified rule for such effects:

## Damage Over Time (Time)

Weapons with this property inflict damage over a period of time due to effects like Radiation, Fire, or other lingering hazards. The damage is applied at the start of each affected creature's turn.

- The weapon deals its initial damage upon a successful hit.
- The target then takes additional damage equal to half the damage taken last time frame at the start of each time frame until the damage is reduced to zero.
- The target can attempt a saving throws per the rules of the game to end the effect early.  A sucessful saving throw cuts the amount of damage done during the next time frame in half.

## Deadly - Merged from Source 2

Roll damage dice with Advantage (roll damage dice twice, and keep the higher result).

## Defensive (#)

When a weapon has the "Defensive (#)" property, it is designed to block and parry attacks more effectively.

- **Activation**: The defensive bonus is active as long as you have not used the weapon to attack during your current turn.
- **Stacking**: When wielding two defensive weapons, only the highest bonus is applied.
- **General**: Add # to your defensive value

## Disarming Rule

You need to state you are attempting a disarm before making your attack roll.

- Your attack deals half damage.
- The target must make a Strength saving throw or equivalent, or drop their weapon. The DC for the saving throw is your attack roll result.

## Double

A weapon with the "Double" property is essentially two melee weapons joined as one.

- **Properties**: Each end retains the properties of the original weapons, except for the Two-handed property.
- **Usage**: Double weapons require two hands to use but do not have the Two-handed property. They cannot benefit from features that affect two-handed weapons, nor can weapons with the Two-handed property be given the Double property.
- **Reach**: If the weapon has the Reach property, only one attack per round can benefit from this property.
- **General**: If a character has the means to fight with two weapons, double weapons qualify. This includes benefits from talents, styles, or features related to two-weapon fighting or light-weapon fighting.
- **Special Cases**:
  - If both ends have the Light property, the weapon can be used to make a two-weapon fighting attack and benefits from the two-weapon fighting style.
  - Count as attacking with two weapons.

## Entangling

This property is for weapons that can ensnare targets, such as nets, or wrap limbs in their embrace, like bolas.

- **Restrained Condition**: On a hit, the attacker can choose to stop the target from moving (impose the restrained condition) until the target escapes.
- **Size and Form Limitations**: Targets two size categories larger than the attacker or targets with formless bodies are immune to this property.
- **Trailing Line**: For weapons with a trailing line, like the whip or harpoon, the target can move but only in the direction of the attacker. If the target remains entangled, the attacker can use their action to initiate a Strength contest and, if successful, can pull the entangled target up to 10 feet towards them.
- **Escape**: To escape, the target, or another creature within Close range, must spend an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check. The difficulty varies depending on the system.
- **Destroying the Weapon**: Alternatively, the entangling weapon or its trailing line can be destroyed by dealing it a certain amount of slashing damage. The weapon can only be attacked when it is restraining a target.

## Fast Toggle (Timeframe)

Many futuristic and modern weapons have different settings built into a weapon. Changing settings requires that you spend a certain amount of time making the changes.

- Changing settings requires a "Timeframe" to be spent toggling the weapon to another configuration.  

## Fast Draw (Timeframe)

Some weapons require that you spend a give time frame getting them ready for use in combat.  

- Readying this equipment requires a "Timeframe" to be spent setting up the weapon before it can be used.

## Finesse

This property is for light, fast weapons.

- **General**: When wielding a weapon with the Finesse property, you can substitute a more agile or accurate attribute (like Dexterity, Speed, Accuracy, or Agility) in place of a more strength-oriented attribute (like Strength, Might, Fighting, or Athletics) for the attack bonus and damage die.

### Fragile/Scrap
 
This property is for weapons made of brittle or less durable materials such as wood, stone, bone, or even metal weapons that are thin or improperly made. These weapons are prone to damage and may require frequent repair.

- **Reduced Armor Penetration**: All weapons with the Fragile/Scrap property halve any Armor Penetration values they may have, rounded down.
- **Wear and Tear**: Each time the weapon rolls the minimum damage value, it takes a penalty to its damage rolls. If this penalty accumulates beyond -4, the weapon is considered destroyed.
- **Repair**:  Someone with the appropriate tools and proficiency can repair the weapon. The time it takes to remove each -1 penalty is one hour per penalty point.
- **Weapon Longevity**: The threshold before the weapon is destroyed, as well as the means of repair.

## Gear Bonus(+/- #)

Weapons with this property are cumbersome and difficult to use under certain conditions. They are not well-suited for confined spaces, nor are they easy to wield when mounted. These weapons also prove challenging for smaller creatures.

- **Mounted or Cramped Conditions**: Using a Heavy weapon while mounted or in cramped conditions imposes penalties of -2 attack rolls.
- **Size Limitations**: Creatures smaller than the intended size category for the weapon always suffer the imposed penalties.
- **Off-Hand Restrictions**: Heavy weapons cannot be used in the off-hand.
- **Encumbrance**:  - Heavy weapons count as two items for the purpose of encumbrance calculations.

## Knock-out -- Merged from Source 2

for 1d6 turns. The target must be the attacker’s size or smaller, and
have biological susceptibility to being rendered unconscious from blunt
trauma to the head.

### Light

**Light**  
Weapons with this property are small, easy to handle, and ideal for quick, agile combat. These weapons are beneficial for characters who prioritize speed and finesse over raw power.

- **Encumbrance**:  Light weapons count as half an item for encumbrance purposes. Two light items can fill one line of your Gear/Equipment chart.
- **Dual Wielding**: When wielding a Light weapon in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make an off-hand attack with another Light weapon. The off-hand attack does not add your ability score to its damage. 

### Masterwork Rule

Weapons of this quality are made with exceptional skill and materials. A Masterwork weapon grants the following benefits:

- **+1 to Damage**: Adds +1 to all damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.
- **+1 to Hit**: Adds +1 to all hit rolls made with this weapon. This bonus does not stack with magical bonuses, if the weapon is or becomes magical.
- **Exclusivity**: The person building the masterwork weapon must choose between +1 to hit or +1 to damage, but not both.

- **Tender Love and Care**: Typically adds an additional 1 month wage for the weapons smith of ₢ of in-game currency to the weapon's base value.

### One Use Weapons

Weapons with this designation are engineered for a single use, expending all their energy or ammunition in one action. After use, they are rendered inoperative. The following traits apply:

- **Single Use**: Once activated, this weapon is expended and cannot be used again.
- **Expended Resources**: All ammunition or energy is used up in a single attack, making the weapon useless thereafter.
- **Disposable**: The only thing this weapon is good for after its use is as an improved weapon.

### Quick Draw

Weapons with this attribute are designed for rapid deployment, enabling the wielder to ready and use the weapon as part of the same action. The following traits apply:

- **Swift Action**: This weapon can be readied (drawn or prepared for use) as part of the same action used to attack.

### Reach Weapons

Weapons with this trait are designed to strike at enemies from a greater distance than most melee weapons. A Reach weapon has the following characteristics:

- **Extended Reach**: Adds an additional 2 meters/5 feet to your attack range when using this weapon, effectively doubling your Close range for attacks.

- **On Hold**: If armed with a Reach weapon and not surprised, you can be considered to be on hold for the purposes of attacking an advancing foe only. If someone moves within your reach, you may attack immediately.

- **Close Quarters Penalty**:
  - Attacks against foes within Close range (usually 5 feet or less) impose a specific penalty of a -2 on your attack roll:

### Readied Weapons

Weapons with this property are designed for strategic placement, generally piercing weapons that can be braced or planted in the ground for an opportunity attack.

- **Conditions for Use**: You must not have a hostile creature able to take actions within Close range of you to utilize this feature.
- **Defensive Reaction**: Once per round, if a foe tries to move into Close range with you, you can use your reaction to make a free melee attack against that target with your readied weapon.
- **Special Effects on Hit**: If your attack hits, the attack automatically deals an additional +2 damage.

### Reliable Weapons

These are weapons of exceptional quality, with intricate yet robust mechanics that minimize the chance of malfunction or failure.

- **Reduced Critical Misses**: Your negative results are still a miss, and you may not escalate a miss into a hit, however your miss is always one rank closer to the middle using a reliable weapon.
- **Negating Negative Outcomes**: If you roll and the result is a 1, you may reroll that die to negate this. If the second roll converts the result into a success, you still miss but with no negative outcomes.
- **Increased Cost for Referee Interference**: The cost for the Referee to trigger a weapon jam or similar negative effect is double for this piece of gear, making it less likely to happen.
- **Greater Things to Come**: Reliable items may become Specialized Tools, Elite Gear, or Named Items.
- **Tender Love and Care**: Typically adds an additional 1 month wage for the weapons smith of ₢ of in-game currency to the weapon's base value.

### Serrated

**Serrated**  
Weapons with this quality are designed to rip and tear through flesh, making them highly effective against unprotected or lightly armored targets. Note that this quality only applies to weapons that deal slashing damage.

- **Armor Penetration**: Weapons with this quality lose the Armor Penetration quality.

- **Rend Armor** Hitting an unarmored target allows you to use a fast action or maneuver to deal an extra point of damage. If you hit a target with light armor, you can then on perform a fast action to reduce their Armor rating by 1; armor reduced to 0 rating is destroyed, making the target unarmored for future attacks.

## Shield Grappler -- Merged from Source 2

Attacking with this weapon negates an opponent’s shield.

## Strangle -- Merged from Source 2

Following a successful hit, this weapon inflicts automatic damage each round. The victim cannot move and suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A successful hit on the attacker allows the victim to break free.

## Stun

This quality is for modern weapons. It is a typical setting for blasters in a futuristic settings and even batons from such settings may have this property. Also known as zap weapons.

- Unless noted otherwise, stun settings only work out to Short range.
- Deals stress (or Wits & then Empath) damage. A critical success stuns the target for the next round: they cannot take any actions.

## Thermal Sweep

For futuristic weapons that fire a continuous beam that can be swept across several enemies.  

Works as Auto-Fire (Sweep)

## Tiny

This property is mostly for ammunition, though it could represent smaller weapons carried by small characters too.

Tiny items do not count towards encumbrance.

## Toggle (#)

Weapons with this quality have a trailing line that can connect to targets. The line's length is denoted by "#." When a weapon with the Toggle and either Barbed or Entangling properties hits a target, the following rules apply:

1. **Line Connection**: A trailing line connects the target to the attacker. The attacker determines the length of the line, up to "#" units.

2. **Breaking the Line**: To break the line, the target (or an ally) must:
   - Deal 2 slashing damage, (against standard target number ).
   - Make a Strength or Might check, with the difficulty varying by system (against a standard target number).

3. **Restricted Movement**: If the connected target wishes to move beyond the length of the line, they must succeed in an opposed Strength check against the wielder.

4. **Wielder's Choice**: If the target successfully moves away, the wielder can either:
   - Drop the weapon, which will be dragged away by the target.
   - Spend a action to keep the weapon. If the weapon has the Barbed property, pulling it free deals damage to the target as per the Barbed rules.

## Tripping

For weapons that have hooks or protrusions made to take people to ground, or entangling weapons like whips that can be used to yank legs out from under foes.

- This only works on a creature up to one size category larger than the wielder of the disarming weapon.
- You can choose to deal half damage and knock the target prone.

### Unbalancing

Weapons with this quality are typically weighted or designed in a way that they can throw the wielder off balance if not used effectively. If you attack and miss your target with an Unbalancing weapon, the next melee attack against you gains a +2 bonus before your next turn unless you spend a fast action to recover.

### Versatile

Versatile weapons are flexible in terms of how they can be used. They can be wielded with one or two hands, offering various benefits depending on the method. The rules for small creatures and for ranged and melee uses differ.

 **Melee & Ranged**: When used in two hands, you can reroll any one die not showing a 1.
 **Size-Dependent Handling**: Small creatures must wield these weapons in two hands but use the standard damage. If a small creature attempts to use the weapon in one hand, the weapon is treated as having the Heavy property.

## Very Bulky

Some weapons are designed only for the strongest combatants. A character
using a Very Bulky weapon must have Strength 12 or higher to use it without
penalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal to
the difference between their Strength DM and +2.

## Wrap-Around

For weapons that have large hooks or flexible components capable of wrapping around shields.

- Weapons with the wrap-around property ignore any defense bonus a target has due to using a shield or weapon with the defensive property.

## Zero-G -- Merged from Source 2

This weapon has little or no recoil, allowing it to be used in low or zero gravity situations without requiring an Athletics (dexterity) check.

## Ion Weapons - Merged from Source 2

By means of massive electromagnetic pulses, overloading or power systems or other exotic effects, ion weapons have the potential to temporarily disrupt critical systems on board a ship without causing permanent damage. This can give a vital edge in combat while an enemy ship recovers or force an enemy to surrender before the disabling attack is followed up by something far more potent.

Instead of dealing damage as usual, Ion weapons use the following rules.

> When an Ion weapon successfully hits a target, roll for its damage but ignore any armour the target possesses. Instead of applying damage to the target’s hull, it is instead temporarily deducted from the target’s Power, representing the disabling effects as they spread throughout the ship and the crew working hard to keep the most vital systems online.
>
> This reduction in Power will last until the target completes its next set of actions, in either the current Ounces (⏱) or the next.
>
> If the Effect of the attack roll is 6 or more, the reduction in Power will last for D3 rounds.

# Weapon Properties from Gamma World

**Complexity.**  This is either Simple, Complex, or Multipurpose.  A simple object uses the rules for discovering the use of simple objects. Complex objects use the rules for discovering the use of complex objects.  Multipurpose objects can have multiple ratings for each purpose in which case you might see a rating of 4S 1C for 4 simple purposes and 1 Complex purpose.

A simple example of this is a bayonet, which is essentially a dagger attached to a gun, this would be rated a 2S complexity; one for the gun, and one for the dagger.

**Aim / Rate  / Reload.** Aim is the number of actions it takes to prepare the weapon for attack.  Formally Aiming a weapon will be determined by class, proficiency and feats.  This number represents the number of actions regardless bonuses from proficiency, feats, or class that it takes to get the weapon ready to attack.

Rate of Fire is the number of actions it takes to attack with the weapon.  Some weapons may take multiple actions.  Some weapons may allow for multiple attacks per action.

Reload is the number of actions it takes to reload a ranged weapon.  Please see Weapon Properties on Ammunition and Firearms to further understand this action.

**Operators:** This is the number of people required to operate the weapon.  Some large siege weapons and weapons with higher tech levels require more than one person to successfully use the weapon.

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

**_Light._** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**Radius.**  A weapon or the ammunition a weapon uses may do damage to more than just the target.  In the case of explosives, this represents the damage done to everything within that radius.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**_Explosive._** The explosive property denotes that the weapon does damage to everyone within the weapon’s radius as calculated from the point of impact.  The number found after the Explosive keyword is the DC for the dexterity check that is required to avoid damage.

**_High Explosive._** The high explosive property is a subtype of the Explosive property.  This property denotes that the weapon does damage to everyone within the weapon’s radius as calculated from the point of impact.  The number found after the High Explosive keyword is the DC for the dexterity check.  On a successful check, the target takes half damage.  

**_Firearm_**.  The firearm property is a subtype of the ammunition property.  Firearm ammunition is destroyed upon use. Some firearms use bullets while futuristic firearms are powered by a special type of ammunition called energy cells. An energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its firearm can make.

**_Burst Fire._** A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can hit a single target with three shots with one attack.  Each shot must roll to hit separately.  This action uses three pieces of ammunition.

**_Auto Fire._** A weapon that has the auto fire property can make a normal single-target attack, a burst fire attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This action uses ten pieces of ammunition.

**_Reload._** A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).  You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

**_Scatter_**.  An attack is made against each creature within a 30ft cone.  If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage to a hit.

**Misfire.** Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapons Misfire score, the weapon misfires.  The attack misses and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try to repair it.  To repair your firearm , you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8+ misfire score)  If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.

**Explosive.**  Upon a hit, Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

**Stationary.** A stationary weapon has to be set up before it can be fired. Setting up a stationary weapon requires an action.

**Mass Produced.**  A society that is two tech levels higher than the tech level that introduced the weapon can mass produce weapon, ammunition, or armor.  When this is done, the weapon acts like it is fragile as well costing half the amount it costs normally.

**Mastercrafted.**  This weapon was crafted by a master craftsman.  When rolling damage dice and any one dice rolls it’s maximum add an additional +1 to the total damage rolled.
