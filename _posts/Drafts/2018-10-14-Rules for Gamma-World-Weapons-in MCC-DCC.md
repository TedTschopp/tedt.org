# Notes

The following rules are based on my playtesting of running Gamma World in MCC.  I want to make sure the feel and flavor of Gamma World's weapons is available to people who want it in MCC. 


## Blasters 

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |

### Mark V Blaster Pistol
This unusual weapon’s ray weakens the nuclear force binding the the nuclei of atoms. All things touched by the beam disentegrate cleanly without dust or odor. This creates light, intense heat, and very little noise, and leaves an impressive 10cm hole in the target. Even the air is affected, making the beam visible as a white, near instantaneous streak. 

### Mark VII Blaster Rifle

This is a larger more effective version of the Mark V that fits into the form factor of a rifle that weakens the nuclear force binding the the nuclei of atoms. All things touched by the beam disentegrate cleanly without dust or odor. This creates light, intense heat, and very little noise, and leaves an impressive 10cm hole in the target. Even the air is affected, making the beam visible as a white, near instantaneous streak. 

### Mark XII Blaster Pistol
The Mark XII Blaster is an expermental weapon built right before the great disaster  It is the favored weapon of the Knights of Genetic Purity. The Purists use this ultra-powerful beamed weapon to annihilate any visibly mutated human on sight or keep their armies of slaves in line. 

## Black Ray 

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Pistol | Black Ray Pistol    | 7 | 7 | 100 | Fortitude Save vs. Death |C-Cell| 4 | 1 | N/A | 1/2kg | priceless | Rank |
| Rifle | Black Ray Rifle | 7 | 7 | 500 | Fortitude Save vs. Death  |2xC-Cell| 4 | 1 | N/A | 3kg | Priceless | 2 x Rank |
| Siege | Black Ray Cannon  | 7 | 7 | 650 | Fortitude Save vs. Death  | f-Pack | 6 | 1 | N/A | 250kg | Priceless | 4 xRank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

### Black Ray Pistol
The ultimate hand-held weapon, it is powered by a Chemical Energy Cell good for 4 shots. Fortunately, few Black Ray Pistols are available. They instantly kill an organic target not protected by a Force Field, but have no effect on inorganic or dead organic matter or on those inside a Force Field. 

This looks like a clear plastic gunstock holding a black crystal 1 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.

### Black Ray Rifle
The ultimate hand-held weapon, it is powered by 2 Chemical Energy Cell good for 4 shots (total). Fortunately, very few Black Ray Rifles are available. They instantly kill an organic target not protected by a Force Field, but have no effect on inorganic or dead organic matter or on those inside a Force Field. 

This looks like a clear plastic rifle stock holding a black crystal 2 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.

### Black Ray Cannon
This dangerous piece of 24th century direct fire field gun is similar to those usually found on Warbots. It causes instant death to living targets not protected by force field. It does no damage to inanimate (non-living) targets, or targets protected by a force field.

Awesomely lethal, it is almost never seen on a mobile platform, but rather as a fixed direct fire firle gun piece, usually supplied with Nuclear power and controlled by an automated system (cybernetic installation, think tank, etc...) or operated manually from a nearby bunker. In this configuration, the weapon has unlimited power available for firing. The black ray cannon is only very rarely seen as a field piece, mounted on a wheeled or antigrav base that can be towed behind a vehicle. 

This looks like a black crystal 3 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.


## Harmoic Disruptor

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Siege | Harmonic Disruptor    | 7 | - | 100 | See Rules |3xSolar| 10 | 1 | N/A | 100kg | priceless | 4xRank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

The Harmonic Disruptor is a highly fragile and ancient artifact. Less than 20 are known to exist, and many a skirmish has been fought to possess one. Unfortunately, these battles often end in the destruction of this rare and powerful relic.

The disruptor looks like a 5 meter tall cluster of violet crystals held in a plastisteel case with many glass covered dials and finger controls of various colors. When activated, it sends out waves of harmonious sonic vibrations that cause damage to everything within its 100 meter range.

All targets within the damage radius receive 4d6 points of damage until either the harmonic disruptor is disables, deactivated, turned off, or until the victim leaves the 100 meter radius. All items of glass, hard metal, pottery, hard plastic, and plaster within the radius take one point of structural damage per Action Turn. Once the item loses all its hit points, it shatters from the harmonic stresses, and becomes permanently useless. 


## Drone Weaver

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Drone Weaver    | 7 | - | 1/3 mile | See Rules |1xSolar| N/A | N/A | N/A | 100kg | priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

There are two types of Drone Weavers known in existance.  The Sphere and the Strand.  The Strand looks like a multicolored bead on the end of a 3 foot long braided strand of spun crystal.  The Sphere is a small metal sphere, 10 centimeters in diameter, has a small control panel under a flush hatch. There is a 12-button keyboard and LED readout underneath the hatch. The Strand drones are controled via Holocontrols via a qualified ID Bracelet.  The user specifies a trigger condition of elapsed time or motion detected (by size). He then specifies a traveling distance (0 to 500 meters) and direction. The drone weaver can lie dormant for decades without reducing its effectiveness. Once triggered, the drone rises 1 meter off the ground and floats away at a speed of 5 meters per round. When it has traveled its specified distance, it begins to wander randomly and broadcast subsonic sound waves. These cause all creatures within range to make a MS check at -3. Those that fail must flee until they can no longer hear the noise. The subsonics can be heard up to 100 meters away. 


## Flying Blades

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Flying Blades    | 7 | 5 | 165| 1d8 |1xSolar or 1xC| N/A | 1 | N/A | 100kg | 750 Ð | 600 |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This strange weapon is designed to distract and injure opponents while causing minimal harm to their equipment. It looks like a thick, circular saw blade. It has a single recessed switch in the center of one side that activates it. The reverse side has a covered socket for a power cell. Thrown like a frisbee toward the target, the flying blade begins spinning at a high speed and flies on at 20 meters per round, searching for living heat sources. It is able to distinguish the intense heat of an engine from the lower level heat of a living creature. It moves straight ahead for 10 rounds searching for targets. If it doesn't find one, it falls to the ground, drained of energy. The initial to-hit roll is only used to determine if it is thrown in the general direction desired by the character.

Once it has locked onto a target, it splits into three separate blades, each attacking with +6 to-hit, doing 1d8 points of damage with each pass. Each blade can make one pass per round. After five rounds of fighting, the blades fall to the ground. Only chemical or solar power cells can be used in this device. 

## Lamprey Disk

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Melee | Lamprey | 7 | 5 | See Below | See Below | N/A | N/A | See Below | N/A | 1kg | 3000 Ð | 1500 |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This is a metal disk about the size of a normal human hand. One side is strongly magnetized and will adhere to any steel surface with a strenght of 8. A switch on the same surface turns the disk on or off. The switch is not accessible when the disk is stuck on a surface. When turned on, the disk absorbs magnetic and electrical fields within 3 feet. It can drain a chemical power cell in one round, a hydrogen cell in 10 rounds, and an atomic power cell in 20 minutes. Quantium cells are drained of all stored energy but will build up a charge when removed from the Lamprey field.  Any powered equipment affected by the disk, including robots, operates at half power. Weapons do half damage, robots and vehicles move at half speed, robots get half as many attacks per round, etc.


## Neural Bite

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Melee | Neural Bite Mark I | 5 | 3 | Melee | Stun | N/A | 8 | 1 | N/A | 1/2kg | 1,200 Ð | 600 |
| Range | Neural Bite Mark II | 5 | 3 | 50 | Stun | Nx1 | 4 | 1 | N/A | 1kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

There are two weapons with the name Neural Bite.  The first one is an actual whip with poison.  The second one is a ranged version of this weapon that was inspired by the Neural Bite wip.

Mark I: The neural bite looks much like an ordinary whip, but the last 20 centimeters (8") of this 3-meter-long lash bristle with small metal barbs. The barbs are unable to penetrate armor that provides an AC of 5 or less. If the barbs do penetrate, a nerve drug is injected into the opponent, dramatically altering his nervous system. This potent substance, intensity 18, acts like a paralytic poison, but results of paralyzed or worse means loss of free will (this drug cannot kill). The result is a mindless slave, who follows any orders he or she is given. The drug is injected into the neural bite with a syringe through a small rubber aperture, ringed in red, near the hilt. The weapon can hold up to eight doses at once.

Mark II: This looks like a silver metal ring, 1 foot in diameter, and bears a variety of multicolored beads along its perimeter.  When activated, it occilates in the air and flies at its target using its base range.  Each turn it may attack a different target that is within melee range with a spark of energy that ignores the effects of armor and force fields.  The vitims must make a save (Will Power) or call under the domination of the Neural Bite's controller.  

## Popper Pellet

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Popper Pellet | 6 | 3 | Thrown | See Below | N/A | 1 | 1 | N/A | 5g | 250 Ð | 25 |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

The popper pellet is an ocher kernel about the size of a large marble. To activate the item, the user throws it into an activated force field. Once it makes contact with a force field of any kind (excluding Mutational Force Fields), the popper pellet instantly gains the necessary power it needs from the field. Once attached, the popper pellet cloaks itself from IR, UV, and visible light, making it invisible to most individuals and sensors. It travels to the highest point of the force field (above the head for most powered armors and above the turret for tanks or robots).

While attached, the popper pellet lessens the effectiveness of the force field by five points (needed for the popper pellet’s own operations). If five points are not available, the popper pellet is unable to attach itself, and falls to the ground deactivated. The popper pellet also deactivates and falls if the force field drops for any reason.

When a popper pellet is thrown at a force field, the individual sees the popper pellet suddenly disappear as it comes into contact with the force field. In response, the force field generator beeps and blinks a warning stating the field strength has been reduced. 


## Smart Dart

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Smart Dart | 6 | 6 | Thrown + 40 | 3d6 Electrical | Chemical | 1 | 1 | N/A | 1kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This looks like a doublesized flint arrowhead with iridescent edges.  When activated or flug at a target it homes in on the targets form and auroa.  The vistim must make a Reflex save each turn to avoid the dart, but the dart continues to attack the target until it strikes something.  When it hits it errupts in a flashing ball of eletricty, harming all within 30 feet. 

Once the Smart Dart is discharged it falls to the ground needing to be recharged again.  It will take plug into a standard Chemical battery and regarge over the span of 1 hour.  It can only hold 1 charge at a time.

## Slither Helix

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Slither Helix | 6 | 6 | Thrown + 30 | 1d3 Progressive +1die | 1xSolar | 1 | 1 | N/A | 1kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This looks like a rainbow-colored ribbon 10' long.  When activated it animates and slithers after its target, attacking with its energized touch.  If struck a victim may make a REF Save to avoid being wrapped up in the Helix.  The victim takes profgressive damage (save vs. Fortitude) each each turn it misses the Fortitude save.  The Slither Helix has 25 hitpoints.  It can only be harmed by physical damage.

## Stinger Crystal

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Stinger Crystal | 6 | 6 | 30 | 1d6 | 1xSolar | 1 | 1 | N/A | 1kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

Stinger Crystal  This diamond shaped arrow is multicolored. when activated it springs into the air, hovering and spinning at the users shoulder.  It can be used either to strike a foe with a melee attack or block a physcial or energy attack.  When blocking, the Crystal has 50 hitpoints.
