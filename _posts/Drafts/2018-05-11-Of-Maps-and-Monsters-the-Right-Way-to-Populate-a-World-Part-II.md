# Notes

This work is the beginning of a collection of notes on Monsters and Maps.  In the future I will split this out into several different sections.  I wanted to start wtih what I had here and start working my thoughts out while getting some of this out of my head and into a place I can review and look at.

# Monsters
One of the aspects of making a sandbox type of role playing game is that many times the monsters that the players run into do not make sense.  These rules are things I am trying to put down to make a computer controlled map generator that can be used to simplify the planning process for people running a game. A lot of this information was inspired and taken from around the web and expanded upon.

## Monster variation
Today in most role playing games monsters are reduced to a handful of stats that do not make them unique.  The first activity that I think is needed for a database of monsters to run into is that these monsters need to have random stats.  Not every player character or human today has the same strength.  The basic idea here is that there is some variation.  Many times this variation is reduced to simplify bookkeeping and that makes sense.  Today however we have rather powerful computers that can work on handing some of that bookkeeping.  Therefore I propose that attributes be replaced with a set of dice.  


### Stats for Exceptional Members of the Encounter

#### Bonuses to stats vs. Bonuses to skill and combat rolls on a given stat

#### Types of Exceptional Members
If someeone wants to pick more than one type of archetype for the character in question, and there are two bonuses to a given stat than the dice are rolled and the larger of the bonuses are taken.  Bonuses do not stack.  Example:  Someone wants to be a Giant Leader.  Giant gives someone 1d3+3 hit dice up the dice chain.  Leader gives 1d3 increase up the dice chain.  The Giant 1d3+3 rolls a 1+3 = 4 die increase, while leader grants a 1d3 that rolls a 3.  The resulting increase in hit dice is 4.  

##### The Leader
A leader of a given group will have the following:

* Increase Hitdice by 1d3 dice up the dice chain
* Prioritize the following for these creatures with a 1, 2, and 3
   * Physical Prowess (The Alpha)- Add Priority to AC and Reflex or Strength Modifier
   * Personality / Looks (The Commander) - Add Priority to Personality Modifier
   * Health - Add Priority to Fortitude Modifier
 
*[dice chain]: (d3《》d4《》d5《》d6《》d7《》d8《》d10《》d12《》d14《》d16《》d20《》d24《》d30) 


##### The Giant 
A Giant of a given group will tend to have the following:

* Increase HitDice by 1d3+3 up the dice chain 
* Increase Stamina modifier 2d3

##### Dire or Prehistoric
These creatures are normal creatures that are generally larger and have built in weapons in the form of horns, teeth or spikes.  They may have built in armor in the form of heavy fur, hardened bony plates, or thicker skin.  They also have a heightened intelligence if their base species doesn't have such intelligence.  These creatures also will act as Alpha leaders in groups of the normal creatures of the base species.  However if the base species is sentient, these are generally more dull, in which case the Prehistoric creature the thug or dullard the group keeps around to beat up on others.

###### Dire
For these rules the dire creature is one that is more intelligent than his base species.  

* Increase HitDice by 1d3 up the dice chain
* Increase Fortitude Save by 1d3
* Increase Strength modifier by 1d3
* Increase AC by 2d3-2
* Increase Damage from each non-weapon attack by 2d3-2 up the dice chain
* Increase Personality modifier by 1d3

###### Prehistoric
For these rules the Prehistoric creature is one that is less intelligent than his base species.  

* Increase HitDice by 1d3 up the dice chain
* Increase Fortitude Save by 1d3
* Increase Strength modifier by 1d3
* Increase AC by 2d3-2
* Increase Damage from each non-weapon attack by 2d3-2 up the dice chain
* Decrease Personality modifier by 1d3

##### Magical, Blessed
Magical or blessed creatures are those that are blessed by the Gods, Magic, or appear so normal people.  Fey creatures are like this many times.

* Increase in Personality modifier by 1d3
* Prioritize the following for these creatures with a 1, 2, 3 and 4
   * Physical Prowess (The Alpha)- Add Priority to AC and Reflex or Strength Modifier
   * Health - Add Priority to Fortitude Modifier
   * Increase Speed by 5' x priority
   * Horns, Claws, hooves, or Teeth - Increase Damage from one non-weapon attack by priority up the dice chain
* TODO: Add Spell
* TODO: Add Aura


#### Types of Subnormal Members of the Encounter
* Child, Grunt, Beta, 
* Dwarf, Miniature, Pygmy, Tiny, Teacup, Pixie - 
* Dire, Prehistoric - Powerful, Dangerous, Deadly, Larger, Humans are dumber and everything else is smarter
* Magical, Cursed (Demonic) - Calculating, dark, with fiery highlights.  
* Magical, Cursed (Hideous) - Ugly, Chaotic, random, insanity inducing 
* Magical, Cursed (Doomed) - Pitiable, an object lesson, extreme to the point of humiliation.
