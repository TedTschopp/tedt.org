Mission: To Care for the crops, animals, buildings, grounds of a farm
Description: 'An ecobot is basically humanoid, and is most notable feature is its
  four evenly spaced arms.  It has two legs and 1 1/2 meter long arms with hand manipulators.  Half
  of its large, barrel-like chest is a sorage tank (100 liters) for whatever needs
  to be carried: seed, water, milk, feed. etc.  It has a polite but firm, male voice.'
Equipment: The ecobot comes standard with an envirolyzer, soil analyzer, shovel, IR
  camera, 5x range telescope, radio, spotlights, stun ray pistol, and chainsaw
Reactions: A common I.D. card allows the operator to com-mand the robot to perform
  any menial farm/landscaping chore or to temporarily stop whatever it is doing. A
  supervisor's card can reprioritize the chores or command the ecobot to perform nonfarm-related
  or nonpark-related tasks, so long as it doesn't leave the farm or park property.
  Only a civil authority card or a program override card can get the robot to leave
  its territory. The ecobot will never respond to mutated animals or plants as sentient
  creatures on an equal level with people. Its particular programming is geared to
  have it take care of animals and plants. On the farm, animals are to be kept in
  the pens or the barn. In the parks, people are ordered to stay away from the animals
  for their own protection. If they do not, the animals are stunned and taken away
  to a safe place. Animals are shooed, or even stunned, to keep them out of groomed,
  landscaped areas. Plants are only allowed to grow in specified places. On the farm,
  a sentient plant would be considered a weed to be cut down if among the crops (or
  crop area). Other locations arc okay for a plant to grow in as long as the plant
  doesn't interrupt traf-fic patterns. In a park, plants are allowed to grow wild
  only in the natural areas. Sentient plants in a landscaped area will he cut down
  and removed.
