Description: These are mutated garden snails that make their homes in old rusted appliances,
  vehicles, and robots. They creature itself is a 4 meter formless blob with 3 tentacles
  sprouting from its sides. They are very vulnerable in this state (AC 10). But because
  of their unique habitat, they are almost always well protected, by the sturdy carapace"
  of whatever metallic hulk they choose to live in. Young rust'ee can be found in
  small metallic appliances, oil drums, etc. As they grow larger they will periodically
  move into something larger. The biggest rust'ee may inhabit an Ancient robot or
  even a car or a truck!

Behavior: A rust'ee will usually appear no different from any other heap of scrap
  metal until prey comes near. Then, the creature will shoot out one or more tentacles
  which both stun (2d10 damage) and poison (into 12) their victim. Once subdued, the
  carcass will be hauled into the shell to be devoured.Rust'we aren't intelligent
  and don't appear to be social creatures. But explorers have reported seeing more
  than one of them where enough metal exists (e.g. old scrap yards, parking lots,
  and industrial ruins).Archivists have been known to keep rust'ee as guard beasts
  to deter any who would try to steal from their holy lands.
