Description: Ba'mutan are gentle herbivores that have evolved into extremely large,
  well-defended creatures.  They resemble a copper colored armadillo with a dragon's
  head.  They can grow up to 30 feet in length, and they are over 12 feet tall.  They
  are primarily nocturnal and thus almost completely blind in the daylight.  However
  their hearing is excellent and can get around with just that sense.   Ba'mutan have
  large shells that can conceal the formation of a "land pearl".  A little less than
  half of the Ba'mutan out there have these pearls.  There is no way to determine
  if a given Ba'mutan has a pearl outside of killing it and spending four days extracting
  it from its shell.   Because of this, over time the Ba'mutan who were solitary creatures
  have become extinct and the only surviving creatures are herd animals.  This means
  that groups of these creatures will be found together and attacking one to extract
  its pearl will cause the whole herd to panic and attack.

Behavior: Gas generation generates a cloud that has a 25' radius centered on creature.  The
  gas dissipates after 1d10+2 turns.  Any creature not completely protected from the
  environment takes 3d10 damage per turn of exposure, and their vision is obscured.
