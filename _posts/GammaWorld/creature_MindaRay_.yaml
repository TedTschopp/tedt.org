Description: This creature is a detached part of a sentient coral reef (see below).
  A successful attack means the creature has bitten its target (1d4 damage). A second
  attack against the victims AC means the creature has attached itself to the victim
  and stabs the victim for 1d6 damage. A third successful attack means the creature
  has entangled the spinal cord and now controls the creature via the Coral Reef (see
  above). Once the creature is attached, all of the target creature's abilities are
  under the control of the reef. Any land creature which is controlled by the Minda
  Ray can breathe both water (after 10-20 seconds) and on land, as the ray breathes
  for the creature underwater and the land animal can breathe for both creatures on
  land.
