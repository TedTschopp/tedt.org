Description: The hideous result of an accidental overexposure to radiation,Gallus
  Gallus 5/13 is a living abomination to Man's technology. This mutated chicken species
  is malignant to the core and seeks to dominate all other creatures.The superior
  mental ability of this mutant makes it a cunning and deadly foe.These creatures
  are quite adept at figuring out the workings of technological items,and within their
  own physical limitations are skilled at using the artifacts created by the Ancients.
  For some unknown reason every Gallus Gallus 5/13 has a Complete Mental Block against
  Companion Units.These mutants appear fat and squatty,and are covered with patchy
  yellow-orange feathers.Their exposure to radiation in the lab has left these mutant
  chickens with two very bizarre features;one beneficial and the other a defect.Instead
  of having two eyes,Gallus Gallus 5/13's possess one large central green eye (Body
  Structure Change).This unfortunate defect means that these mutants lack depth perception,and
  must fight in melee with a -1 penalty "to hit"and when using ranged weapons with
  a -2 penalty "to hit."Their former wings have been transformed into thin stubby
  feathered arms with hand-like appendages (New Body Parts). These newly acquired
  "hands,"although only having three fingers, are what permit the Gallus Gallus 5/13's
  to manipulate artifacts and weapons.Probably their most effective mutation of all,
  and the one used with great cunning,is their Chameleon Powers for this allows them
  to often attack without first being seen by their victims. Unknown to all these
  mutant chickens is their lack of resistance to poison of any type.Poison is instant
  death to the Gallus Gallus 5/13 unless the correct antidote is immediately administered.
  Even then there is only a 50% chance that the mutant will live.
