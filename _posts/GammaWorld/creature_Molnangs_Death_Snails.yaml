Description: 'Horribly dangerous and destructive predators, molnangs leave an unmistakable
  trail of blasted earth (no living plants or animals or even their remains) wherever
  they go. For this rea- son, they are sometimes called pathfind- ers or roadbuilders
  in moments of dark humor. If this path is touched before it is a day old, the victim
  takes 1d6 hp damage from the residual acid. About 50% of all molnang encounters
  begin with the discov- ery of a molnang track, so molnangs are often surprised or
  left alone.Molnangs cannot hear, but if they see a living creature within 30 meters
  in front of them, they train their eyestalks on the interloper and fire a beam equal
  in every way to that of a black ray gun. If hit from behind, a molnang turns (this
  takes an action turn) and fires. It can fire a ray every other action turn.The molnang
  secretes a powerful acid all over its black body. If touched in combat, the acid
  does an automatic 10d6 hp dam- age to the snails opponent, its weapon, or its armor
  (as appropriate). The acid ruins any weapon except one made of duralloy, which can
  survive one (and only one) hit. When an attack misses the snails body, it is assumed
  to hit the massive, golden shell, which is as sturdy as duralloy, reflects all kinds
  of energy except kinetic (including heat, cold, radiation, electricity, sound/ blasters,
  and light/lasers), and is proof against acid and black rays.If it fails a morale
  check (most likely, if hit more than once or twice in combat), a molnang withdraws
  into its shell, pulls the operculum shut, and generates a death field. Thereafter,
  it is unable to fire its death ray (even after regaining conscious- ness) for the
  rest of the day. Strength equal to the molnangs (in one creature) is required to
  pull the operculum open while the molnang is alive inside (even if it is unconscious).
  The molnang can, however, be attacked by a life leech and other men- tal mutations.
  Vibro weapons and energy maces are not reflected by the shell.Molnangs are good
  to eat, once they have been leeched of their acid content. However, they contain
  muscleworm larvae (DRAGON issue #108) 75% of the time, and so should be cooked carefully.
  The brilliant metallic gold shell is a far greater prize, as it can be cut with
  vibro tools into shields which reflect beams of heat, light, radiation, sound, etc.,
  as well as acid and black rays. (They are no help against a burst of energy such
  as a bomb or a sonic last however.) Such actions require a check vs. DX x 4 for
  a character to bring the shield into play during normal combat conditions (assuming
  the character is not surprised). The shell weighs 500-800 kg and is worth twice
  that in gold pieces to someone who can make use of it.Molnangs are seldom hired
  or recruited because it is all but impossible to safely communicate with them.'
