Description: The Krea looks like a nightmare.  It is a snail that stands just over
  5' in neight.  The head of a Krea is a lime green frog like head.  Four 15 foot
  tentacles splay out from beneath the head.  It has a great gaping mouth that is
  lined with bony ridges as sharp as meat cleavers.

Behavior: Krea are incredibly destructive just for the sheer cruelty of it.  In addition
  to their fearsome attacks, they can teleport every third turn up to 100' away as
  long as the distance is in line of sight.
