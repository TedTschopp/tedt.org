Description: The frequent compan- ions of lils, ribbets are small, green, splay- footed
  frogs with considerable mental powers and a lively sense of humor. They seldom attack
  a creature with injury in mind, unless seriously threatened or harmed themselves,
  but they often play pranks, particularly on a low reaction roll. Their favorite
  tricks involve levitation, magnetic control, time manipulation (which does not cost
  them hit points, but is limited to two days maximum and can be split down to five
  minutes), and memory erasure, a mental attack which, if successful, erases 1dl2
  hours of accumu- lated knowledge in one creature. The range of this attack is 30
  m, and it can be made once per five Action Turns. Multiple successful attacks are
  cumulative in effect.Ribbets are almost always encountered in treetops, about 15
  m above the ground. They are in range for most of their attacks, but they are difficult
  to spot at that distance and angle, since they sit on green leaves larger than themselves.
  It takes a check vs. IN x 1 to spot them well enough for any kind of to hit roll.
  Rib- bets are not unfriendly and can be hired, recruited, or negotiated with. However,
  they are capricious, and their material needs and wants are few, so they can be
  difficult to persuade.Ribbets glide rather than fly, using their large, webbed feet
  and the skin flaps on their sides, behind their forelegs. They cannot take off from
  ground level, and generally glide from tree to tree. They can move 1 m horizontally
  for every 1 m altitude with which they start.
