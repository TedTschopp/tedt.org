Description: ''
Equipment: 'The Battlebot comes with two blaster cannons (short/medium/long ranges
  and damages: 500m, 75 hp/1,000m, 50 hp/2,000m, 25 hp); 2 black ray cannons (300m
  range); 4batteries of four Mark VI blasters (400m range); 2batteries of four Mark
  XI masterblasters (500m range); two trek guns (damage as the bomb with a 200m range);
  ten laser batteries of five guns each (short/medium/long ranges and dam ages: 750m,
  20d6/1500m, 15d6/3,000m, 10d6); 5d10 fusion and fission bombs with a 3,000m launcher;
  a special energy dampening field that kills robotic units and energy-using devices
  within a 20m radius, and causes 10 points of damage every round to force fields.'
Reactions: Though never found dormant or in storage, only the highest command I card
  can give it instructions. Maintenance ID cards work normally but are subject to
  extreme scrutiny from the Battlebot (assuming both the card and the Battlebot are
  from the same military base. Programmer's cards can not be used on the machine.
  In the event of an attack upon its base or upon itself, the bot does what it must
  to drive off or destroy the attacker.
