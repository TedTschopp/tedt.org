Description: The S. Reindeer was originally designed to serve as a surplus pulling
  unit for the X.M.A.S. unit's sleigh. It has been modified to act as Fire Support
  for the protection of the X.M.A.S. unit. Its systems are internal. Mini-missile
  launcher (20d10) Flame Thrower (10d10)All units, including the laser weapons, are
  powered by broadcast power from the robot factory, giving units a range of 500 kilometers.
  The S. Reindeer will react to any physical attack with the flame thrower in their
  tails. Their mini-missiles are shot on the instructions of the X.M.A.S. unit. If
  the X.M.A.S. unit is destroyed, the X Unit Sleigh and remaining S. Reindeer will
  return to the factory at maximum speed. Although the X.M.A.S. unit is programmed
  to be jolly, it will not allow itself to get into situations where it can be easily
  destroyed.
