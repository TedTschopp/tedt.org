Description: This slenderly built creature is easily recognized because of its snowy
  white fur and glowing pink eyes.The albilope,a descendent of the antelope,still
  has the general appearance of its fore-runner except for two noticeable changes;it
  is an albino and it has a unique two-pronged horn in the middle of its forehead.

Behavior: The albino nature of this mutant resulted because of the anti-life leeching
  power that developed, and it is believed that the alibilope is one of the first
  creatures to have evolved with this powerful ability.A thick fur appeared on mutants
  as a means of protecting themselves against both the cold and harmful radiation.
  Albilopes are immune to cold attacks and their thick, white furry coat effectively
  doubles their constitution score (from 8 to 16) when determining the results of
  radiation exposure on the Radiation Matrix. In addition to its distinctive albino
  look,the Albilope possess a single deadly horn in the center of its forehead.This
  30 centimeter tall Y-shaped horn has a saw toothed edge and is razor sharp.Any wounds
  delivered by the alibilope's horn will inflict 3-12 points of damage on the round
  it hits and will result in 1-4 more points of damage each round after-ward due to
  the excessive bleeding caused by the cut. The bleeding can be stopped if the wound
  is attended to and properly treated. Albilopes are omnivores that usually eat plants,
  but when hungry,they have been known to viciously attack vulnerable prey.Their great
  speed allows them to catch unsuspecting creatures,but more import-antly it permits
  them to escape most of the predators found in this area.
