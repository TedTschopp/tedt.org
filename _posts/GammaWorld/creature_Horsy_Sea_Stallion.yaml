Description: Horsy (sometimes spelled Horsea) are giant ridable seahorses. Many underwater
  races prize them as mounts. They are capable of very fast movement underwater and
  are easy to train once domesticated. Their only attack consists of smashing into
  an opponent. The Horsy must have enough room to move in order to use this attack.
  Horsy are quite loyal creatures whether it's to a family group or rider.
