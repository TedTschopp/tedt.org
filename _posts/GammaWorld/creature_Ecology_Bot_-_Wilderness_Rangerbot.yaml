Description: This mechanical Forest Ranger is about the same size and shape as the
  Ecology Bot-Agricultural. It has two 6 meter long tentacles and four 3 meter long
  tentacles. All are equipped the same as the tentacles on the Ecology Bot - Agricultural
  (but there is an 80% chance they have electrical stun). All have soil, air and water
  analysis labs, nozzles for spraying the same liquids as Ecology Bots - Agricultural,
  (but with defoliants in addition), a sonic torch, laser torch, flame gun and vibro
  saw. Each has capture equipment including a paralysis field with a 30 meter range
  (works like a Stun Grenade), a net launcher with 3 weighted throwing nets and a
  20 meter range, and a collapsible man-sized duralloy cage. A veterinary Medi-kit
  will be included that works on Mutated Animals the way a normal Medi-kit does on
  Pure Strain Humans. The kit also has surgical tools for the Robot's use.
