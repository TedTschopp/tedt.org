Description: The horl choo is an odd black plant that looks like a lumpy porcupine
  with long quills, about a meter in diameter with quills about a meter long, it's
  also known as the 'spiny' or 'spear-thrower' plant. It can move with a slow, shuffling
  motion and usually does so only at night, seeking better hunting grounds. Although
  it has no visible eyes or ears, a horl choo can sense heat (notably body heat) and
  has a rudimentary sense of touch (but no other senses).

Behavior: Bufs are extremely stubborn, mercenary in all their dealings, and not to
  be trusted unless the financial aspects of the dea are worked out in their favor
  in advance.  Bofs develop family units they call herds, of an alpha male, and 4
  to 5 beta males.  The herd will then consist of a couple dozen females and their
  young.  Young males, who are kicked out of their herd sell their services until
  they are old and experienced enough to attract females and start their own herds.  A
  bof may show loyalty to an individual who has saved his life; this will override
  all thoughts on double crossing the person that saved them.

Combat: Horl choo are capable of flinging their spines as weapons up to a distance
  of 40 meters (10/20/40 range). The spines are tipped with a hemotoxin and connected
  to the horl choo by thin, tough fibers, allowing it to reel in impaled prey to its
  root cluster, where digestive acids break it down into food for the creature. A
  horl choo bristles and flings its spines when threatened as well, and is capable
  of 'dropping' spines (releasing the fiber connecting them to its body) in order
  to flee.
