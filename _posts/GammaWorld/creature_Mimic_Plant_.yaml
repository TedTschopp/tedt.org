Description: Mimic plants are mutated orchids that grow up to 3 meters high. They
  have large showy flowers that can look like various animals. Mimic plants grow near
  ponds and their root tendrils extend into the water from underground. Their roots
  absorb large amounts of water that are given off by their leaves as a fine mist.
  The mist obscures vision enough that the flowers are mistaken for animals.Animals
  and characters who find mimic plants have a chance equal to 50% minus their intelligence
  of believing the plant to be an attractive animal or character of the opposite sex.
  When a creature is attracted to within 6m of the plant, an elastic tentacle whips
  out and wraps itself around the victim. The tentacle secretes a corrosive fluid
  which contains adaptive enzymes. The fluid burns the skin for 2d4 points of damage
  if it is not washed off in a number of turns equal to 11 minus the victim's armor
  class. The tentacle will withdraw as soon as the victim fights back. No plant will
  attack two crea-tures, and no creature will be attacked by more than one plant each
  day.
