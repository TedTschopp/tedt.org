  forward pointing horns.

Behavior: If they ever fail morale check, they will frighten and charge.  When charging
  they double their movement, and their damage.  Although stupid and nervous by nature,
  their great strength makes them the most popular draft animal.

New_Description: These slow, but powerful, mutated oxen sport a tough cluster of horns
  , which angle generally forward from a bony plate across the crown of their heads
  . These horns form a partial carapace which protects the head and shoulders of the
  1akux. Both male and female rakoxen possess their impressive horns . Young rakoxen
  begin growing the horns shortly after they are weaned . Adult rakoxen are about
  2 meters tall at the shoulder. Although rakoxen are prone to panic and stampede,
  they are one of the most favored draft animals m Meriga tor heavy labor.
Combat: Rakoxen typically attack when they are spooked . The rakox will gore with
  its extraordinarily dense set of horns once per round and can charge if the target
  is more than 10 meters away. Rakoxen are exceptionally strong for their size (PS
  24), giving them a bonus to damage and THAC in combat . A normal gore attack does
  2d6 + 6 points of damage, while a charging attack does 4d6 + 6 points .
Society: Rakoxen roam plains areas in large herds, grazing in groups of 20d 10. They
  are also found in many Tech Level II and III civilized areas, where they are used
  to pull wagons , plows, etc . Domestic rakoxen often have their horns saw down or
  capped by their owners. If sawn , the horns grow back in a season , requiring them
  to be cut again . Rakoxen are rarely ridden, since they tend to buck off riders.  In
  many places, older rakoxen are butchered for food. The meat is salty but otherwise
  palatable . The hide can be cured and used , but it is less serviceable than rog
  hide (see the "Campaign " chapter). The horns are hollowed out and made into musical
  instruments or storage containers , like gunpowder horns.
