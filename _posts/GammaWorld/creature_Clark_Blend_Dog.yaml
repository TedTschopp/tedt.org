Description: Truly neither fish nor fowl, the terl is a 2 to 3 meter long mutant baracuda
  that is covered in bright parrot like feathers rather than scales, and capable of
  breathing air. They are capable of 'swimming' through the air via telekinesis. They
  live in trees like birds as well.  The Trel returns to the water to spawn in the
  spring and it is fully capable of breathing both water and air.

Behavior: As with normal dogs, this breed uses simple pack tactics to surround, and
  bring down weakened prey, or solitary travelers. The main difference is the fact
  that they also will use trees to help them surround their prey. So if you are in
  a forest, and find yourself surrounded by a pack of these creatures, don't bother
  to climb a tree to escape. You'll find yourself staring down the maws of several
  of these animals.  Just as a normal pack dog, these animals are lead by both an
  alpha male and alpha female. The rest of the pack is subservient to these, unless
  another male thinks it is strong enough to challenge the leader. Females tend to
  build dens high in large trees, ruins, or if nothing appropriate is available, in
  dens on the ground. The females give birth late in spring to litters of 2D4 pups.
  The pups, if caught at an early age, can easily be domesticated. Wolf climbers can
  not be domesticated however.
