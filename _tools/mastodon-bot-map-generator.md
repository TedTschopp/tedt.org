## What it does

This Mastodon bot emits a **procedural wilderness traversal**—a simple, narrative map that moves through biomes using a lightweight symbol/emoji language.

## How to use it

- Visit / follow: [tschopp.net/@mapbot](https://tschopp.net/@mapbot)

## Notes

- The generator is inspired by classic TTRPG random wilderness terrain procedures.
