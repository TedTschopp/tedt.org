## What it does

Islands is an interactive island/terrain sim. It generates a world from a seed,
then lets you step the simulation forward and inspect the terrain.

## How to use it

- Open: [islands.tedt.org](https://islands.tedt.org/)
- Set a seed and click **Apply** (or use `?seed=...` in the URL)
- Use the built-in keyboard shortcuts to step, pause, and toggle overlays

## Notes

- Tip from the app: pressing any key stops the initial auto-run.
  Press/click **R** to restart.
