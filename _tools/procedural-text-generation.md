## What it does

Procedural Text Generation is a web app for generating text from **procedural/random tables**.

It’s a practical “idea engine” for brainstorming: roll up details, combine traits, and build prompts from composable pieces.

## How to use it

- Open: [randomtables.tedt.org](https://randomtables.tedt.org/)
- Pick a table/category, roll, and combine results into a larger description
- Refresh/roll again to iterate quickly on variations

## Notes

- The long-form project writeup is here: [Procedural Text Generation](/procedural-text-generation/)
- This is an evolving system that also feeds other generators and bots.
