#Biography 
biography:
  - I am the enterprise architect at Southern California Edison (SCE), serving over 20 million people across 430 cities and 50,000 square miles. In my role, I offer strategic guidance on all software and products developed in IT to executives, senior leadership, and business stakeholders, drawing on my 25 years of experience at SCE.
  - Before joining Edison, I owned a business featured in Wired Magazine.  I founded the largest J.R.R. Tolkien community website. Earlier, I worked in market research for the automotive industry.
  - I love working in technology as it provides me with the opportunity to watch the future unfold. Some of the things I have worked on were considered science-fiction when I was in school. This means I get to work on hard problems with brilliant people using complex and cool tools.
