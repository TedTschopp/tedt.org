| Strategic misalignment with enterprise value drivers | IT strategy diverges from business outcomes, creating conflicting priorities and diluted impact.        |
| Stakeholder buy‑in failure                           | Executives and BUs do not align on strategic choices, eroding sponsorship and slowing decisions.        |
| Weak external sensing (market/tech/regulatory)       | Strategy relies on stale or narrow signals and misses inflection points or disruptions.                 |
| Unclear prioritization & sequencing of bets          | Strategic initiatives are not ordered or focused, causing resource thrash and opportunity cost.         |
| Underfunded strategic priorities                     | Funding for key initiatives is insufficient or volatile, undermining delivery and credibility.          |
| Ambiguous risk appetite & guardrails                 | Inconsistent or undefined boundaries drive uneven decisions and hidden exposures.                       |
| Flawed build–buy–partner decisions                   | Choices create vendor lock‑in or miss ecosystem leverage and innovation pathways.                       |

| Governance bypass / pet projects           | Initiatives circumvent intake, stage‑gates, or evidentiary standards, consuming budget without scrutiny.                   |
| Optimism bias in business cases            | Benefits are inflated or costs/risks underestimated, skewing prioritization and undermining returns.                       |
| Dependency & sequencing failure            | Cross‑initiative dependencies are missed or misordered, causing delays, rework, and blocked critical paths.                |
| Funding volatility & stop‑start churn      | Mid‑year reprioritizations or budget shocks force starts/stops that destroy momentum and sunk value.                       |
| Critical‑skill bottlenecks                 | Scarce roles (e.g., data engineers, architects) become constraints, stalling multiple initiatives despite funding.         |
| Unfunded run‑state / sustainment costs     | Operational, support, and licensing tails are omitted from cases, creating future cost and risk spikes.                    |
| Portfolio data quality & transparency gaps | Inconsistent definitions and reporting obscure status, risk, and value, impairing timely decisions and course corrections. |
