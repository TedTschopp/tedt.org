## Introduction and Scope

### Purpose

### Scope Inclusions & Exclusions

## Baseline and Target Architecture

*(Guidance: Summarize the **Baseline** (current state) and **Target** (future state) technology architecture for the solution. Describe the existing technology components and configuration in the current environment, then describe the planned technology components and architecture in the target state. Highlight the differences and **gaps** between baseline and target – i.e. what changes are needed to achieve the target state. You may include a brief gap analysis explaining how the current technology falls short of requirements and what must change to meet future needs. Use this section to set the stage for subsequent details.)*

### Baseline Architecture:

*(Placeholder – describe the current technology environment, including hardware, software, platforms, and integrations as they exist today. List the major technology components, their versions, and how they are deployed. Include any known pain points or limitations in the baseline.)*

### Target Architecture:

*(Placeholder – describe the future technology environment required. Outline the new or updated technology components, platforms, and services that will be part of the solution. Emphasize improvements or differences from the baseline. Ensure the target aligns with business requirements and objectives.)*

### Gap Analysis:

*(Placeholder – if applicable, enumerate the gaps between the baseline and target. For each gap, briefly note what needs to change or be implemented (e.g., new system, upgrade, decommission, integration) to transition to the target state. This can include technology that must be added, retired, or modified. Optionally, reference any work packages or projects addressing these gaps.)*

## Platform Services

*(The Platform Services section above should be tailored by the team to reflect the current and target state of both IT end-user services and OT/field device platforms in the organization.)*

*(Guidance: Document the core **infrastructure platform services** supporting the solution. Break this into categories such as **Compute**, **Storage**, and **Network**, and describe the components in each. Include any virtualization or cloud platform details. This section provides an inventory of foundational tech components (servers, databases, networks, etc.) on which the solution runs.)*

### Compute Services

*(Placeholder – describe the compute resources such as servers, virtual machines, cloud instances, or container platforms. Include details like operating systems or virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware, Kubernetes), CPU/memory sizing, and hosting environment (on-premises data center or cloud provider).)*

### Storage Services

*(Placeholder – describe data storage components. Include databases (SQL/NoSQL), data warehouses, file storage systems, or object storage. Mention capacity needs, clustering or replication (if any), and storage technology (SAN/NAS, cloud storage, etc.).)*

### Network Services

*(Placeholder – describe network infrastructure and services. This may include LAN/WAN connectivity, network zones/VPCs, routers, switches, firewalls (listed here for completeness but detailed in security section), load balancers, and DNS. Note network segmentation or connectivity between sites/cloud regions. Also include any CDN or network optimization services.)*

### End-User Compute Services

> **Guidance:** Describe how end-user devices (e.g. employee laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones) are provisioned, managed, and supported. Include standard hardware/OS platforms, management tools, and user-facing services.

#### Common Platforms

List the standard device types and operating systems supported for staff (for example, Windows 11 laptops, iOS/Android mobile devices, etc.). End-user computing (EUC) encompasses the technologies IT uses to **deploy, manage, and secure the devices, applications, and data** that workers need. This includes physical PCs, mobile devices, virtual desktops, and related applications. Identify any virtualization or remote desktop solutions (VDI, DaaS) in use to support remote work or specialized workloads.

#### Provisioning & Deployment

Outline how new user devices are acquired and set up. For instance, describe imaging or enrollment processes (such as using **MDM/UEM** tools to automatically configure devices with required software and policies). Mention if BYOD is allowed and how those are onboarded or segregated. Include any self-service portals or automation for deploying standard applications to endpoints.

#### Device Management

Specify the enterprise services for managing end-user devices. This may include directory services (e.g. Active Directory/Azure AD) for authentication, **enterprise mobility management** suites for mobile devices, client management tools for patching software, and endpoint configuration management. For example, unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions can enforce mobile device policies on PCs and phones from one console. Highlight how policies (like password requirements, encryption, VPN configurations) are applied to ensure a consistent and secure user device environment.

#### User Services

Summarize key platform services available to end-user devices (office productivity suites, email, collaboration tools, file storage, etc.). Note any cloud services (e.g. Office 365, Google Workspace) versus on-premises services and how endpoints access them (direct internet, VPN, etc.). Ensure to cover how end-user devices connect to corporate networks (enterprise Wi-Fi, VPN for remote access, etc.) and any supporting network access controls.

### Operational Endpoint Device Services

> **Guidance:** Describe the technology environment for operational endpoint devices – e.g. smart grid and field equipment. Include the hardware/software platforms, networks, and any edge computing infrastructure that support these devices.

#### Device Types

Define the classes of *operational technology (OT) endpoint devices* used in the utility. Examples include smart meters, IoT sensors (distributed grid sensors, environmental monitors), SCADA/industrial controllers (RTUs, PLCs), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) in substations, and edge computing gateways. These are part of the OT systems that **monitor or control physical devices, processes, and events** in the power infrastructure. Mention the typical operating environment of these devices (embedded real-time OS, firmware-based devices, or specialized industrial computers).

#### Connectivity & Network

Outline the communication networks and protocols that link operational devices. For instance, smart meters might connect via a RF mesh or power-line network to data concentrators, then to the head-end; field sensors or reclosers may use wireless (LTE/5G, radio) or wired links to communicate. List relevant protocols and standards (e.g. DNP3 or IEC 60870-5-104 for SCADA, MQTT for IoT telemetry, Zigbee for HAN devices, cellular LTE for remote sites). Describe the field network infrastructure (Field Area Network – FAN, substation networks, edge IoT gateways) that forms the platform for these endpoints. Ensure to include any edge computing layer – e.g. gateway devices or edge servers at substations that aggregate data, perform local processing, and interface with cloud or data center systems.

#### Management & Integration

Explain how operational endpoints are managed and integrated with enterprise systems. Identify the groups or tools responsible for managing OT devices (which may be separate from IT’s device management). For example, SCADA systems or IoT platform software might centrally manage configurations and data from field devices. Note any remote management capabilities (e.g. the ability to update firmware or configurations remotely) and constraints (many OT devices have limited remote management to ensure stability). Also mention how OT data flows into IT systems – for instance, through an integration platform or IoT hub that collects telemetry from field devices for analytics.

#### Platform Services for OT

Highlight any platform services specific to operational endpoints. This could include edge data processing applications, time-series data stores for sensor data, or cloud services used for IoT device management. Additionally, note any **converged IT/OT platform** considerations – for example, if the utility uses common identity or network services across IT and OT, or if they are intentionally segregated. Emphasize reliability and real-time requirements for these platforms, as many operational devices support critical grid functions (e.g. power distribution automation) where low latency and high availability are paramount.

### Other Platform Components

*(Placeholder – include any additional foundational services such as messaging backbones, identity directory services, or container registries if they underlie the technical solution. For each platform service, ensure to list the technology and any relevant configurations.)*

## Asset Management

*(The Asset Management section should be updated with the utility’s specific processes and tools. Ensuring a unified view or at least an aligned process for IT and OT asset tracking is often a goal to support enterprise risk management.)*

**Guidance:** *Define how all technology assets – including both user devices and field/operational devices – are classified, tracked in inventory, and managed through their lifecycles. Incorporate ownership and responsibility for these assets.*

Effective **Asset Management** ensures that both end-user and operational devices are accounted for, properly owned, and lifecycle-managed. This section should cover how the organization categorizes devices, maintains inventories (with relevant attributes), and handles asset lifecycle stages from procurement to retirement. A complete and accurate asset inventory is critical for managing risk, enabling activities like security assessments and patch management. The subsections below distinguish between end-user IT assets and field/OT assets, as their management processes may differ.

### Compute Services Asset Management

#### Asset Inventory and Tracking

Detail systems for tracking compute assets (servers, virtual machines, containers, cloud instances). Explain tagging strategies, CMDB integration, and lifecycle management practices.

#### Lifecycle and Refresh Planning

Document strategies for regular hardware/software refresh cycles, end-of-life asset replacement, firmware/software updates, patch management schedules.

#### Spare Compute Capacity

Describe policies regarding spare compute resources (physical servers, cloud compute reservations, standby virtual resources). Clarify how quickly spare resources can be provisioned during disruptions.

#### Asset Disposal and Secure Decommissioning

Outline secure procedures for decommissioning compute hardware or virtual resources, ensuring data sanitization and compliance with security/regulatory requirements.

### Storage Services Asset Management

#### Asset Tracking and Inventory

Explain methods for managing storage hardware/software assets (SAN, NAS, cloud storage). Describe how assets are recorded, classified, and tracked in asset management systems.

#### Capacity Planning and Expansion

Detail proactive strategies to forecast storage growth and manage capacity expansions. Include processes for regular capacity reviews and storage efficiency measures.

#### Spare Storage Equipment

Identify spare storage equipment kept on-hand (replacement drives, expansion shelves, cloud storage pools) to rapidly address failures. Specify deployment timeframes for critical storage replacements.

#### Data Retention and Archiving Policies

Outline policies for data retention, archiving, and deletion aligned with regulatory/compliance requirements, ensuring storage resources are effectively managed.

### Network Services Asset Management

#### Network Asset Inventory and Documentation

Explain approaches for documenting network assets (switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, access points). Include details on management platforms and configuration tracking.

#### Lifecycle and Upgrade Planning

Detail processes for regular refreshes, firmware updates, and lifecycle management of network hardware. Include criteria for end-of-life replacement and software-defined network evolution.

#### Spare Networking Equipment

Describe spare network asset policies (switches, routers, transceivers, antennas). Outline procedures and timelines for deploying spares in response to outages.

#### Configuration and Change Management

Document practices for configuration backup, standardization, version control, and secure storage of network device configurations to facilitate rapid restoration or deployment.

### End-User Device Asset Management

#### Device Classification & Ownership

Describe how end-user devices are classified (e.g. by type, function, or sensitivity). For instance, laptops/desktops might be “Corporate-owned IT assets”, while personally-owned BYOD devices (if allowed) are a separate category with limited access. Clearly state ownership and accountability – typically, corporate IT owns and manages company-issued devices, while employees may own BYOD devices (with IT having oversight via policy and MDM). Classification can also consider sensitivity (devices handling confidential data vs. general use) to apply appropriate controls.

#### Inventory Tracking

Explain the systems and procedures to inventory all end-user computing devices. The inventory should maintain **unique identifiers** for each device and key details such as make/model, serial number, assigned user or location, operating system, and installed software. For example, the utility might use an IT Asset Management (ITAM) system or CMDB where each laptop and mobile device is recorded. Inventory data should be kept up-to-date when devices are issued, moved, or decommissioned. Regular audits (automated discovery via endpoint management tools or physical checks) help ensure no device is unaccounted for.

#### Lifecycle Management

Detail how user devices are managed through their life cycle: procurement, deployment, maintenance, and retirement. This includes refresh policies (e.g. laptops replaced every \~4-5 years or as needed), as well as processes for repairing or replacing broken devices. Address how devices are retired — for example, wiping data and **securely disposing** of or recycling old equipment. Ensure there are defined owners for each step (IT procurement for sourcing, IT support for deployment and fixes, etc.). **Tracking changes** (like hardware upgrades, or OS re-images) in the asset records is important so inventory remains accurate.

#### Software/Firmware Management

(Tie-in with Security but also asset perspective.) Note that managing the asset includes tracking what software and firmware versions are on each device. For user devices, this means keeping an inventory of OS versions and critical software versions. If the utility uses automated tools, they likely update the inventory when a device is patched or re-imaged. This ensures awareness of vulnerable or outdated systems as part of asset status. Link this with the security patch management process described later.

### Operational Device Asset Management

#### Device Classification & Ownership

Describe how field and operational devices are categorized. For example, categories might include smart meters, substation controllers, line sensors, generation plant control systems, etc. It may be useful to classify by criticality (e.g. “critical OT assets” that have significant impact on grid operations vs. ancillary sensors). Specify ownership of these assets – typically, the operations or engineering departments “own” the operational equipment, though IT or a dedicated OT team may co-manage certain aspects (like networking gear or security). Note any regulatory ownership aspects (for instance, metering devices might fall under a specific department and regulation).

#### Inventory Tracking

Explain the approach to inventorying OT/field devices. Inventory for OT should capture hardware details (device type, model, vendor, serial number, physical location like substation or feeder ID) and firmware/software versions on each device. Maintaining this inventory is challenging but essential for risk management and maintenance. Document what tools or processes are used – e.g. periodic field audits, automated network discovery tools, or asset management modules within SCADA or GIS (Geographic Information System) for mapping field devices. If automated discovery is used, caution that active network scanning in OT environments must be carefully tested to avoid disrupting sensitive devices. In many cases, a combination of passive monitoring and manual updates is employed to keep the OT asset inventory current.

#### Lifecycle Management

Outline how the organization manages the lifecycle of operational devices. These devices often have long service lives (e.g. smart meters might be deployed for 10-15+ years; substation RTUs even longer) and require planning for maintenance and eventual replacement. Describe processes like: commissioning new devices (factory acceptance testing, configuration, then installation), maintenance (including periodic calibration or component replacement), and decommissioning (ensuring devices are securely wiped if they have memory, and disposed or recycled properly). Lifecycle tracking should include monitoring for **obsolescence** – e.g. if a device’s vendor support or firmware updates cease, triggering a plan to upgrade that asset. It’s also useful to keep **vendor information** (contacts, warranty, support status) linked to each asset in the inventory, so that recall notices or firmware updates can be managed proactively.

#### Asset Ownership & Roles

Identify roles responsible for OT asset management. For instance, an Asset Manager in the operations team may be tasked with updating the inventory when field devices are installed or removed. The cybersecurity team may also need insight into the asset inventory to perform risk assessments. NIST guidance suggests defining clear **roles and responsibilities** for asset ownership, operations, maintenance, and cybersecurity for OT assets. This ensures accountability (e.g. who authorizes changes to a device configuration, who responds if a device is found missing). Coordination between IT and OT teams is crucial if there’s overlap (for example, network equipment in substations might be managed by IT, but the devices they connect are OT domain).

## Resilience and Recovery

*(The Resilience and Recovery section should be customized with the utility’s specific DR plans and technologies. The placeholders above ensure that both field operations continuity and enterprise IT continuity are considered, especially highlighting the often-overlooked area of endpoint devices. Engineering teams should fill in details such as RTOs, backup technologies, and roles/responsibilities in recovery scenarios.)*

**Guidance:** *Detail how the architecture ensures continuity of operations and rapid recovery from failures or disasters, covering both field device resilience (operational technology) and end-user device recovery. Integrate endpoint-specific strategies: redundancy, failover, backup, and restore capabilities.*

Resilience and Recovery focuses on maintaining essential functions during adverse events and restoring normal operations afterward. In an electric utility context, this includes ensuring that critical field devices (which support power delivery and safety) have failover or backup plans, and that enterprise IT services (including user devices) can be quickly recovered in event of loss. This section should cover both **architecture mechanisms** (redundancy, backups, alternate systems) and **processes** (disaster recovery plans, failover procedures, restoration workflows). The following subsections separate considerations for operational field infrastructure and end-user computing, though there may be overlaps.

### Compute Services Resilience

#### Failover and Redundancy

Detail strategies to maintain compute availability, such as clustering, N+1 or active/passive configurations, virtualization failover, and automatic workload redistribution (e.g., VMware HA, Kubernetes clusters, cloud auto-scaling).

#### Backup and Rapid Restore

Describe backup processes (e.g., snapshotting, VM-level backups, configuration state backups, container registries). Include recovery procedures for rapid redeployment of workloads on alternate compute resources.

#### Disaster Recovery Strategy

Outline how compute infrastructure supports larger-scale disaster recovery (e.g., geographically dispersed failover data centers, cloud regions). Specify how critical workloads transition to DR environments with documented RTOs/RPOs.

#### Testing and Drills

Explain regular testing procedures (failover drills, compute workload migration tests) to validate resilience strategies. Record key assumptions and documented test outcomes.

### Storage Services Resilience

#### Data Redundancy and Replication

Identify how data redundancy is maintained (RAID, erasure coding, synchronous/asynchronous replication, distributed storage solutions). Document configuration of replication across data centers/cloud regions.

#### Backup and Recovery

Detail storage-level backup methods, including incremental, snapshot, and archival strategies. Outline rapid restoration methods from backup media or cloud storage.

#### Disaster Recovery Planning

Document how storage infrastructure supports DR plans (e.g., off-site backups, cold/warm/hot DR storage facilities, cloud storage failover options), including RTOs/RPOs for critical data.

#### Integrity and Validation

Outline practices for validating storage integrity (regular health checks, checksums, automated recovery from corrupted states). Include periodic disaster recovery tests for storage restoration processes.

### Network Services Resilience

#### Failover and Redundant Connectivity

Describe redundancy in network infrastructure (multiple ISPs, diverse fiber paths, dual-homed WAN/LAN connections, dynamic routing protocols like BGP or OSPF).

#### Network Segmentation and Isolation

Explain use of VLANs, SD-WAN, or software-defined networking to isolate failures and minimize impact of network disruptions. Document rapid traffic rerouting and isolation of problematic network segments.

#### Disaster Recovery and Alternate Connectivity

Outline strategies to maintain connectivity in regional disasters (use of satellite links, LTE backup connections, out-of-band management via dedicated cellular networks).

#### Regular Testing and Validation

Describe testing and validation procedures, including simulated failover tests, periodic connectivity and redundancy drills, and regular assessments against defined RTOs/RPOs.

### Field Device and Edge Services

#### Failover and Redundancy

Describe how the architecture mitigates failures of critical field devices or communications. For example, in substation or distribution automation systems, important controllers (like protection relays or SCADA RTUs) might be deployed in redundant pairs – if one fails, the secondary takes over to continue operations seamlessly. Identify any such redundancy strategies (N+1 configurations, clustered control systems, dual communications links, etc.). Also mention network failover: e.g., if a primary communications network for field devices (such as fiber or radio) goes down, is there a backup path (cellular LTE or satellite link) for critical signals? For smart meters in a mesh network, the mesh itself provides some resilience (neighboring meters route around a failed meter); outline these capabilities to show the system can tolerate individual endpoint outages. In general, **design for no single point of failure** where feasible in the OT architecture.

#### Edge Computing Recovery

If the utility employs edge computing nodes (like data concentrators, substation gateways, or microgrid controllers), specify how those are made resilient. This could include local redundancy (multiple edge devices sharing load), as well as the ability for cloud or central systems to temporarily take over if an edge node fails. For instance, an IoT edge gateway might queue data locally (store-and-forward) – if it goes offline, data is buffered and sent when back up, or a secondary gateway picks up the devices. Document any **state synchronization or backup** for edge devices: do they regularly send config/state to a central repository so a replacement device can be loaded with the last known configuration quickly? Some modern OT platforms integrate with cloud services to backup configurations and enable rapid redeployment of edge functionality on new hardware. Additionally, mention the use of **automated failover**: e.g., if a substation control system detects a primary device failure, it switches to backup automatically.

#### Spare Asset Strategy
A practical aspect of resilience is having spares for critical endpoint devices. Note if the organization maintains an inventory of spare units (e.g. spare smart meters, extra gateway devices, or backup communication equipment) and how quickly they can be deployed. The recovery time objectives (RTOs) for various devices should inform how many spares and of what type are kept. For example, if a critical line sensor fails and must be replaced within 4 hours to restore grid visibility, a spare should be on hand nearby. NIST guidance suggests that for many smaller-scale interruptions, **keeping critical spares** is an effective way to meet recovery objectives. Document procedures to swap in spares (including how configurations are loaded onto the new device from backup). Also, if certain equipment is hard-to-obtain (long procurement lead times), highlight any strategies like long-term contracts or stockpiling to mitigate that risk.

#### Disaster Recovery for OT Systems

In addition to device-level resilience, cover how larger-scale disasters are handled for OT. For instance, if an entire substation is lost (due to wildfire or earthquake, as could happen in California), what is the recovery plan? This might involve system-wide actions like load rerouting, using mobile substations, etc., which is beyond pure IT scope but should be referenced. From an IT/OT architecture perspective, ensure that **critical configurations and data** for field systems are backed up off-site. This means SCADA databases, meter data, etc., have off-site replicas or cloud backups. If using cloud services for some OT data, describe how those enable rapid recovery (for example, meter data collection might fail over to a cloud-hosted head-end if the on-prem system is down). Emphasize **proactive planning and layered recovery strategies** – e.g., having both local and cloud backups, alternate communication paths, and manual fallback procedures as a last resort (like technicians reading meters manually if automated systems fail). The architecture should support flexibility so that the **minimum level of grid operation** can continue during disasters (identify what those minimum functions are, such as protective relays still functioning independently even if central SCADA is offline). Also mention out-of-band management capabilities: for instance, remote terminal units might have out-of-band connections (cellular or satellite) so admins can access devices even if primary networks fail. Out-of-band access can greatly speed up recovery by allowing remote diagnostics or reconfiguration without waiting for a site visit.

#### Testing and Drills

Include a note on how resilience is validated – for example, regular failover testing of redundant systems, disaster recovery drills that include field device scenarios, etc. Engineering teams should be guided to record any assumptions (e.g. relying on battery backup at field sites for X hours) and ensure those are tested. The architecture document can provide placeholders for listing the **RTO/RPO (Recovery Time and Point Objectives)** for key systems and how the design meets them. For edge and field systems, often **near-zero downtime** is desired for critical control functions, which might require innovative solutions (like rapid image-based restore of devices, or hot-standby units as mentioned). All these measures contribute to an OT environment that can quickly **recover from service disruptions** and maintain safety and reliability.

### End-User Device Services

#### User Device Backup

Outline the strategy for protecting data on end-user devices and restoring it in case of device failure or loss. At a baseline, every important user device (especially laptops which may store local data) should have an automated backup solution. Describe the chosen solution – it could be cloud-based endpoint backup software, regular sync to network drives, or reliance on cloud file storage for user documents. The best practice is to make backups **automatic and transparent** to the user, so include how often backups occur and to where. For example: “User MyDocuments and Desktop folders are redirected to OneDrive cloud storage, ensuring continuous backup; in addition, laptops are configured to perform full system backups to a cloud backup service weekly.” Emphasize using the cloud or off-site storage for backups, since cloud backups **minimize loss from physical disasters** like fire, flood, or theft that could destroy on-premise equipment. If both local and cloud backups are used (belt-and-suspenders approach), note that as well. Don’t forget mobile devices: if employees use tablets/phones for work data, ensure either cloud sync or mobile backup solutions are addressed (many MDM solutions include backup features or at least protection for corporate app data).

#### User Device Recovery

Describe the process for restoring a user’s productivity after a device failure, leveraging the backups above. This often includes having standard **images or device provisioning processes** so that a replacement device can be quickly prepared. For example, if a laptop dies, IT can grab a spare from inventory and use an automated provisioning service (like Autopilot or an image from SCCM/Intune) to configure it with the user’s apps and policies within hours. Then user data is restored from backup/cloud. If the organization has a virtual desktop infrastructure, mention that as a recovery option too (a user could use a virtual desktop from another machine while waiting for a replacement laptop). The template should prompt teams to include expected restoration times: e.g. “In the event of a laptop loss, a new device can be provisioned and user data restored within 4 hours,” assuming certain conditions. Also mention any **continuity tools**: for instance, if a widespread event affects many user devices (like ransomware or a natural disaster at HQ), the ability for staff to work from personal devices or a DR site using cloud apps might be the contingency – document those plans.

#### Policies and Training

Ensure reference to any policies that support resilience of user devices. For instance, a policy that all critical files must be saved on approved cloud storage (not just locally) so that they are backed up. And training users that if they suspect a device issue (or if they lose a device) to report immediately so IT can initiate recovery steps. Some organizations also formalize **device replacement procedures** (like having a pool of ready-to-go laptops). If relevant, include that the utility has support agreements or stock to replace X% of devices quickly.

#### Resilience for User Services

Beyond the device itself, consider the resilience of IT services accessed by endpoints. While this might be detailed in other architecture areas, it’s worth noting here: e.g., if email or critical applications are down, having endpoints isn’t useful – so outline that key end-user services are highly available (perhaps cloud-based or on redundant servers). This ties into IT disaster recovery plans where endpoints are one piece of the puzzle.

#### Testing and Improvement

Mention if the organization tests user device recovery (like periodic fire drills where backups are restored to test integrity). Also any metrics – e.g. track how long it takes to rebuild a laptop – to improve the process. User device backup/restore may seem routine, but in a utility during a major incident (like a cyberattack), having a well-oiled process to reimage machines can significantly reduce downtime.

E.g., “Customer Information System – integrated via SOAP API over ESB,” or “Meter Data Management – events consumed via Kafka topic.” Include any batch integrations or scheduled jobs if relevant.)*

## Technology Standards and Product Mapping

*(By mapping components to products and standards, you ensure alignment with enterprise guidelines. Adopt **industry standards** and best practices to guarantee interoperability. For example, using standard protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT, etc.) and data formats (JSON, XML) promotes consistency. Leverage the enterprise Technology Standards Catalog to reference approved technologies.)*

*(Guidance: Define the **technology standards** adopted and map each major architecture component to specific products or technologies. This section ensures consistency with enterprise standards and makes explicit which technology product or service is used for each architecture element. Include versions where important. The template should list each technology domain and the chosen implementation (product or standard) for that domain.)*

## Technology Roadmap and Lifecycle States

*(Overall, the roadmap and lifecycle section ensures stakeholders understand **when** changes will happen and the **status** of each technology (new, mature, or end-of-life) in the enterprise. It connects the architecture to a timeline and portfolio management view.)*

*(Guidance: Provide a **roadmap** for implementing or evolving this technology architecture, and indicate the **lifecycle stage** of key technologies. This section merges timeline considerations with the status (e.g., emerging, mainstream, or retiring) of each technology component.)*

### Roadmap Timeline

*(Placeholder – outline the phases or milestones to move from the current state to the target state. Use a bulleted or numbered list of steps with rough timeframes. For example:)*

  1. *Phase 1 (Q1 2025): Deploy foundational cloud infrastructure and migrate core applications.*
  2. *Phase 2 (Q2 2025): Implement new integration middleware and refactor interfaces.*
  3. *Phase 3 (Q3 2025): Migrate legacy databases to new platform and decommission old systems.*
  4. *Phase 4 (Q4 2025): Finalize security enhancements and conduct performance tuning.*

  *(Each phase should briefly describe the key technology changes and their timing. Align these steps with business planning, and ensure they address the gaps identified between baseline and target.)*

### Technology Lifecycle Status

*(Placeholder – for each major technology or platform in this architecture, indicate its lifecycle state within the organization. For example, note if a technology is **“Strategic (Growing)”**, **“Tactical (Current)”**, **“Contain (Limited use)”**, or **“Retiring”**. Alternatively, use classifications like **Emerging**, **Current**, **Obsolescent**. Provide a table or list, e.g.:)*

  | Technology Component            | Lifecycle State    | Notes                                                         |
  | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Mainframe Batch System          | Retiring           | To be decommissioned by 2026 (replaced by cloud solution).    |
  | Customer Info Database (Oracle) | Current (Standard) | Standard platform, will upgrade to latest version in Phase 3. |
  | Cloud Analytics Platform        | Emerging/Adopt     | New introduction, pilot in progress (strategic direction).    |
  | Mobile Workforce App            | Current (Growing)  | In wide use; plan to expand features next year.               |

  *(This helps in planning by showing which technologies are moving forward and which are being phased out. A **Lifecycle Model** can identify required lifecycle attributes for the infrastructure portfolio, ensuring longevity and support considerations are documented.)*

### Future Evolution

*(Placeholder – briefly mention any known future technology trends or upgrades beyond the current target state. For example, “Plan to incorporate IoT sensor networks in 2026” or “Evaluate quantum-safe encryption by 2027”. This provides forward-looking context to the roadmap.)*

## Infrastructure Resilience and Performance [TODO REMOVE ME INTO SECTION 5]

*(Guidance: Specify the **non-functional requirements** related to resilience and performance that the technology architecture must support. This includes availability, reliability, disaster recovery, and performance (throughput, latency) targets. Also describe how the architecture meets these requirements.)*

### Resiliency and Availability

*(Placeholder – list the requirements for uptime and fault tolerance. For example: “System must achieve **99.99% availability** (maximum \~1 hour downtime/year).” Specify **redundancy** and failover needs: e.g., N+1 clustering, multi-data-center or multi-region deployments for disaster recovery, **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** of X hours and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** of Y minutes for critical systems. Mention backup strategies and any high-availability configurations (redundant servers, clusters, etc.). Also note requirements to handle adverse events: e.g., *“In the event of a datacenter outage, critical services fail over to secondary site within 30 minutes.”* Include how **resilience is designed** into the architecture (e.g., use of auto-scaling cloud services, load balancers, and replicated data stores).)*\*

  *(Resilient technology is critical to maintaining uninterrupted power utility services even during peak demand or unexpected incidents. The architecture should be **agile, scalable, and recoverable by design** to handle component failures or disasters without major service disruption. For instance, ensure the infrastructure can absorb a server failure with no downtime, and that there are clear failover procedures.)*

### Performance and Scalability

*(Placeholder – list performance targets such as system throughput, latency, and capacity. For example: “Support **5000 concurrent users** with page load time under 2 seconds,” or “Handle **1 million smart meter readings per hour** with no data loss.” Define peak load expectations (e.g., end-of-month billing, summer energy peak) and how the system scales to meet them (vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, auto-scaling in cloud). Note any response time SLAs for critical operations. Also mention capacity planning assumptions (initial volume and growth).*

  *Document how the architecture addresses these needs – e.g., “Using a load-balanced web farm and scalable microservices ensures the system can handle spikes in load.” If using cloud, note use of auto-scaling groups or managed services that can grow on demand. If on-premises, note sizing margins or clustering. Provide any performance test or modeling that informs the design.*)

  *(High performance components are essential for a good user experience; for example, using **fast, reliable databases and high-availability servers** to meet customer needs. The architecture should thus include not only resilience but also the **capacity for growth and peak performance**.)*

### Capacity and Growth Planning

*(Placeholder – mention current capacity headroom and strategy for future growth. For example, “Database initially sized at 5TB, with scaling strategy to 10TB as data grows,” or “Application server cluster can scale out with 2 additional nodes to accommodate 2x current peak load.” Align this with the roadmap if capacity upgrades are expected in later phases.)*

### Monitoring and Performance Tuning

*(Placeholder – note how the system’s performance and health will be monitored (e.g., APM tools, cloud monitoring dashboards) and any processes for tuning and optimizing. This might overlap with the **Continuous Monitoring** section in Security for infrastructure health monitoring, but here focus on performance metrics.)*

*(In summary, this section makes explicit how the architecture will meet the utility’s demands for reliability and speed. For a critical infrastructure like an electric utility, designing for resilience (agile, recoverable systems) and for high performance under peak conditions is paramount.)*

## Security Architecture

*(Guidance: Outline the security controls and considerations for the solution’s technology architecture, organized according to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions and categories. The subsections below correspond to key security domains under the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions of NIST CSF 2.0. For each area, describe how the architecture addresses the security requirements, and include placeholders for specifics such as tools, policies, and configurations. This ensures the security architecture is comprehensive and aligns with industry best practices for critical infrastructure.)*

### Asset Management (Identify)

*(All **physical and software assets** related to the system should be documented and prioritized. This provides the foundation for security management by knowing what exists and what is critical.)*

*(Guidance: Document an inventory of all technology assets in scope. Identify hardware (servers, network devices), software applications, data repositories, and external services that are part of this solution. For each asset, capture relevant information: owner, location, purpose, and criticality. Ensure you include physical devices, virtual resources, cloud services, and data assets. This section should answer *“What needs to be protected?”* by listing and categorizing assets.*)

* *Asset Inventory:* *(Placeholder – e.g., list or reference a configuration management database entry for all servers, network gear, and endpoints supporting this solution. Include IDs or names, and roles like “App Server for Customer Portal”.)*
* *Software and Data Assets:* *(Placeholder – e.g., list major software applications, databases, and sensitive data stores (customer data, operational data) used by the solution. Mention if data is classified (public, internal, confidential) and any regulatory implications (e.g., CIP compliance assets).)*
* *Asset Ownership:* *(Placeholder – for each asset or category, note the responsible owner or custodian (could be an individual or team). E.g., “Database X – owned by Database Admin Team; Windows Servers – owned by Infrastructure Team”.)*
* *Asset Lifecycle:* \*(Placeholder – note if assets are tracked through a lifecycle (commissioning, maintenance, decommissioning). Are there processes to keep the inventory updated when assets change?) \*

### Identity and Access Control (Protect)

*(This section ensures that **identities and access privileges** are properly managed and protected. It should address **who/what can access the system** and **how that access is secured**. Identity and access control is crucial for meeting compliance like NERC CIP requirements in a utility context, though this template uses NIST CSF terminology.)*

*(Guidance: Describe how **access to systems and data is controlled**. This covers both user identity management and system access. Include the authentication mechanisms, authorization schemes, and identity lifecycle processes. Align with NIST CSF’s Protect function by covering how the architecture ensures only authorized access to assets.)*

* *User Authentication:* *(Placeholder – describe how users (both corporate users and any external users or partners) authenticate. E.g., “Single Sign-On via Active Directory and SAML/OAuth for cloud services,” or “Multifactor Authentication (MFA) enforced for all admin access.” Mention any identity providers or IAM systems (e.g., Azure AD, AWS IAM, LDAP).)*
* *Access Management:* *(Placeholder – outline how access rights are provisioned and managed. For example, role-based access control (RBAC) definitions: list key roles (engineer, operator, admin) and their permissions in the system. State the principle of least privilege is applied – users get the minimum access needed. If applicable, mention privilege access management solutions for admin accounts and how access reviews are conducted.)*
* *Device and Network Access:* *(Placeholder – mention controls for device access and network access. E.g., “Physical access to servers is restricted to authorized personnel,” and “Network access control (NAC) is implemented to ensure only managed devices connect to the network.” Note if remote access is allowed (VPN, jump host) and how it’s secured.)*
* *Credential Management:* *(Placeholder – describe how credentials (passwords, keys, certificates) are managed. E.g., password policies (length, rotation), use of a secrets vault for application credentials, enforcement of strong encryption for credentials. Include how identities are proofed and bound to credentials if relevant.)*

### Threat Detection and Response (Detect/Respond)

*(By having robust monitoring, the architecture ensures timely detection of anomalies or attacks. Coupled with a well-defined incident response process, the organization can **mitigate and contain threats** effectively when they occur. This is vital for a utility company to minimize disruptions.)*

*(Guidance: Explain the capabilities for **detecting cybersecurity events** and for **responding** to incidents. This section combines the NIST CSF **Detect** and **Respond** functions to cover how the architecture monitors for threats and what processes/tools are in place to react when incidents occur. Outline the security monitoring infrastructure, incident response plan, and related tools.)*

* *Security Monitoring & Detection:* *(Placeholder – describe the tools and processes for continuous security monitoring. E.g., “A Security Information and Event Management (**SIEM**) system aggregates logs from servers, network devices, and applications, providing real-time analysis and alerting.” Mention sources like IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents on servers, anti-malware tools, and any anomaly detection systems. If using outsourced Security Operations Center (SOC) services, state that. Also note scheduled vulnerability scans or penetration tests as part of detecting potential weaknesses.)*
* *Incident Response Plan:* *(Placeholder – summarize the incident response process. E.g., “An **Incident Response Plan** is in place, aligned to NIST guidelines, which defines how to classify incidents, roles and responsibilities, and communication flows.” Mention the existence of an incident response team (internal or external), and any runbooks or playbooks for likely scenarios (e.g., malware outbreak, data breach). Indicate that the plan covers containment, eradication, and recovery steps for incidents. Also mention if the architecture includes automation for response, like automated isolation of a compromised server.)*
* *Response Tools and Capabilities:* *(Placeholder – list tools that aid in incident response, such as forensic analysis tools, incident tracking systems, or automated response platforms. E.g., “Use of EDR allows immediate isolation of infected hosts,” or “Backup and restore tools are in place to recover data quickly if ransomware is detected.”)*
* *Communication and Reporting:* *(Placeholder – note how incidents are reported and escalated. E.g., “Alerts from the SIEM trigger notifications to on-call security personnel 24/7,” and “There is a defined communication plan to inform management, regulators, or customers as needed during significant incidents.” Include any integration with broader enterprise incident management.)*

#### Data Protection and Encryption (Protect)

*(These measures ensure that **data is securely handled and stored**. By encrypting data at rest and in transit, and by controlling access, the architecture reduces the risk of data breaches or leaks. Even in a breach scenario, encrypted data would be less likely to be usable by an attacker.)*

*(Guidance: Describe how **data is protected** through its lifecycle (at rest, in transit, and in use). This includes encryption measures, data handling policies, and protective controls to prevent data leakage or alteration. Align with NIST CSF Protect by covering the **Data Security** aspects.)*

* *Data-at-Rest Protection:* *(Placeholder – explain measures for encrypting data at rest. E.g., “Customer and operational data stored in databases and file systems is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Encryption keys are managed by a key management service (KMS) with strict access controls.” Note any database-specific encryption (TDE – Transparent Data Encryption) or disk-level encryption on servers. Also mention how backup data is protected – e.g., encrypted backups.)*
* *Data-in-Transit Protection:* *(Placeholder – describe how data moving over networks is secured. E.g., “All internal service calls and external interfaces use **TLS 1.3** encryption for data in transit. HTTP APIs enforce HTTPS only. VPN tunnels are used for site-to-site data transfer between corporate and cloud networks.” If applicable, mention use of secure protocols (SSH, SFTP) for any file transfers or the use of message-level encryption for certain integrations.)*
* *Access to Sensitive Data:* *(Placeholder – outline controls for restricting and monitoring access to sensitive information. E.g., role-based access to databases (only DBAs and app service accounts), use of data masking or tokenization for sensitive fields (like customer PII or financial data) in non-production environments. Mention if data stores maintain audit logs of access. Also, reference data classification: “Customer personal data is classified as Confidential and stored in segregated database schemas with additional access restrictions.”)*
* *Data Loss Prevention (DLP):* *(Placeholder – if relevant, mention any DLP measures in place to prevent exfiltration or unauthorized copying of sensitive data. E.g., “Email and endpoint DLP solutions prevent sending of customer data outside authorized channels,” or “Cloud storage buckets have policies to prevent public exposure.”)*
* *Integrity and Backup:* *(Placeholder – mention how data integrity is ensured. E.g., checksums or integrity monitoring on critical files, database consistency checks. Also, tie in backup strategy: “Regular backups are performed and encrypted. Backup restoration is tested periodically to ensure data integrity and availability in case of corruption or loss.”)*

#### System and Communications Protection (Protect)

*(By implementing these measures, the architecture **secures system boundaries and communications**. Network segments are protected by firewalls and only necessary traffic is allowed, reducing the attack surface. Systems are hardened and equipped with protective controls (like NAC, firewalls, anti-malware) to prevent and deter attacks on the infrastructure.)*

*(Guidance: Describe how the architecture protects the **systems themselves and their communications**. This includes securing the network infrastructure, implementing system hardening, and using protective technologies to shield the environment. This aligns with NIST CSF categories like Protective Technology and also overlaps with NIST SP 800-53 families such as System & Communications Protection.)*

* *Network Security:* *(Placeholder – detail the network-level protections. E.g., “**Firewalls** are deployed at network perimeters and between network zones to inspect and filter traffic. Default-deny policies restrict unnecessary communications.” Mention segmentation: “The OT network (operational technology) is segmented from IT corporate network, with only whitelisted communications via a firewall/diode.” If applicable, include use of demilitarized zones (DMZ) for any external-facing systems. Also note any Web Application Firewalls (WAF) protecting web services.)*
* *Secure Communications:* *(Placeholder – ensure that protocols and ports used are secure. E.g., “All inter-service communication uses secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS-encrypted gRPC). Insecure protocols (telnet, FTP) are not permitted.” If the system uses wireless or field communications (common in utilities), mention encryption and auth for those channels as well.)*
* *System Hardening:* *(Placeholder – describe how servers, network devices, and applications are hardened. E.g., “Standard build configurations are applied to servers (secure baseline images) disabling unnecessary services and enforcing secure configurations. Regular patch management is in place to keep systems updated against vulnerabilities.” Mention use of configuration benchmarks (CIS benchmarks or similar) if followed. If applicable, include that administrative interfaces are restricted (e.g., admin consoles only accessible from specific secure networks).)*
* *Protective Technologies:* *(Placeholder – list any additional security tools deployed to protect systems. E.g., **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** on network ingress/egress, **anti-malware/endpoint protection** on servers, integrity monitoring tools (file integrity monitoring on critical systems), and DDoS protection services for public-facing endpoints. Note resiliency mechanisms as well: “The system design includes redundancy and failover mechanisms to achieve resilience against infrastructure attacks.”)*
* *Communications Monitoring:* *(Placeholder – mention if communications are monitored for security purposes. E.g., “Network traffic is monitored for suspicious patterns using an IDS and anomalies trigger alerts in the SIEM.” This might overlap with the Detection section, but here emphasize protection of comm channels.)*

#### Security Continuous Monitoring (Detect)

*(This continuous monitoring ensures that the organization can **detect anomalies or malicious activity quickly**. It goes beyond reactive detection, by also keeping an eye on system health and compliance on an ongoing basis. For a critical infrastructure company, continuous monitoring is key to early warning of cyber threats.)*

*(Guidance: Detail how the organization continuously monitors the environment to identify security issues proactively. While some monitoring was mentioned under Threat Detection, this section can expand on the broader continuous monitoring program for both security and compliance.)*

* *Logging and Audit:* *(Placeholder – describe the logging strategy. E.g., “All servers, network devices, and security appliances send logs to a centralized log management system (or SIEM) for aggregation and analysis.” List key logs collected: authentication events, firewall logs, application logs (especially security-related events). Mention retention: logs are retained for X days to support investigations and compliance.)*
* *Vulnerability Management:* *(Placeholder – explain how vulnerabilities are continuously assessed. E.g., “Automated vulnerability scans run monthly on all servers and network components. Critical vulnerabilities are tracked and remediated within Y days as per policy.” Mention any use of agent-based monitoring that checks system configurations for drift from baseline. If applicable, include monitoring of software dependencies for known vulnerabilities.)*
* *Security Metrics and Dashboards:* *(Placeholder – note if there are metrics or dashboards that are regularly reviewed. E.g., “We track metrics like patch compliance percentage, number of intrusion attempts blocked, and time to remediate incidents. A security dashboard provides real-time status of these metrics to IT management.”)*
* *Third-Party and Supply Chain Monitoring:* *(Placeholder – if relevant, mention oversight of third-party connections or services. E.g., “Connections to third-party service providers are monitored and those providers are required to report any security incidents. We also monitor software supply chain by using only vetted dependencies and scanning container images for vulnerabilities.”)*
* *Continuous Improvement:* *(Placeholder – state that monitoring results feed back into improving security. E.g., “Regular security reviews are conducted using the data from monitoring to adjust firewall rules, update training, and improve response processes.”)*

#### Recovery Planning (Recover)

*(With a solid recovery capability, the organization can **restore normal operations quickly after an incident**. This includes having up-to-date recovery plans and regular drills. In the context of NIST CSF, this section ensures the **Recover** function is addressed by planning for various disaster/incident scenarios and how to bounce back from them.)*

*(Guidance: Describe the capabilities and plans for **recovery and resilience** in case of a cybersecurity incident or major system failure. This aligns with the NIST CSF **Recover** function, ensuring the organization can restore operations and learn from incidents.)*

* *Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:* *(Placeholder – summarize the disaster recovery strategy for the technology components. E.g., “The DR plan stipulates that in case of primary data center loss, systems will be recovered in a secondary data center in Region B. Data is replicated in near-real-time to the secondary site, ensuring an RPO of 15 minutes. The DR failover process is documented and can be executed within 2 hours (RTO) for critical systems.” Mention the frequency of DR plan testing, e.g., full DR drill conducted annually with results documented.)*
* *Backup and Restore:* *(Placeholder – detail the backup approach. E.g., “Nightly backups of databases and weekly full server backups are performed and stored encrypted offsite/cloud. Backup integrity is tested monthly. In the event of data corruption (e.g., ransomware), systems can be restored from backups within X hours.” Include any specific recovery tools or services, and ensure alignment with recovery time objectives.)*
* *Recovery Procedures:* *(Placeholder – outline at a high level the procedures to recover each major component. For instance, “If application servers fail, rebuild from infrastructure-as-code scripts is possible in 1 hour.” Or “In case of cyberattack leading to system rebuild, documented hardening and deployment procedures ensure systems can be rebuilt from scratch using clean sources.” The idea is to show that for each major failure mode, there is a plan.)*
* *Post-Incident Improvement:* *(Placeholder – mention how the architecture and processes are updated after incidents. E.g., “After any major incident or DR test, a lessons-learned meeting is held and the recovery plan is updated accordingly.” This shows continuous improvement in resilience.)*
* *Coordination and Communication:* *(Placeholder – note roles and communication in recovery. E.g., “The Incident Response Team coordinates with the Infrastructure Team during recovery. Stakeholders (executives, affected business units) are kept informed of recovery progress as per the communication plan.” If public communication is needed (for outages), mention that as well.)*
