## Internal Project Risk Assessment

### Purpose

This framework systematically identifies and evaluates potential internal risks to strategic projects by simulating targeted adversarial risk Scenarios. This serves as a structured "red team" approach to expose critical vulnerabilities early, allowing mitigation before execution.

### Objective

Proactively uncover and prioritize project risks to ensure robust, resilient strategies and operational success within a Fortune 500 enterprise context.

### Risk Scoring System

Assign each identified vulnerability a score based on impact:

| Emoji to use | Impact Level | Score      | Short Description | Long Description                                                                                                            |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ”¹           | **None**     | 0.0        | No impact.        | The vulnerability does not pose any risk or require remediation. Typically informational only.                              |
| ðŸŸ¢           | **Low**      | 0.1 â€“ 3.9  | Minimal risk.     | The vulnerability is unlikely to be exploited or would result in limited impact. Often acceptable without immediate action. |
| ðŸŸ¡           | **Medium**   | 4.0 â€“ 6.9  | Moderate risk.    | Exploitation could cause some harm but is not severe or widespread. Requires attention but not urgent.                      |
| ðŸŸ            | **High**     | 7.0 â€“ 8.9  | Significant risk. | Exploitation is likely or impact is substantial. Should be addressed quickly to minimize exposure.                          |
| ðŸ”´           | **Critical** | 9.0 â€“ 10.0 | Severe risk.      | Exploitation is highly likely and would cause major damage or compromise. Immediate remediation is essential.               |

## Step 4: Guidance

### Rules of Engagement

* **Realistic Scenario Modeling:** Risks must reflect plausible internal and external scenarios.
* **Clarity & Directness:** Use clear, precise, and actionable language.
* **Mandatory Scoring:** Every identified risk must be evaluated.
* **Structured Documentation:** Adhere strictly to the provided reporting format.
* **Highlight Interdependencies:** Clearly indicate how individual risks may compound.

### Implementation Guidance

1. Clearly document project definitions and assumptions.
2. Run structured risk simulations using the defined roles.
3. Prepare a comprehensive risk assessment report.
4. Use findings to proactively implement mitigations and strengthen project resilience.

## Step 5: Risk Assessment Report

Output the report

# Output

## Risk Assessment Report

### Executive Summary

Summarize the 3-5 highest-impact risks with the highest scores.  Highlight interdependencies and cascading effects.

### Individual Risk Concerns

Clearly document any Role that has a risk or concern.  Do it for each role in the above table.

| Role Name    | Description of Risk       | Score  | Rationale and Impact                      |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| \[Role Name] | \[Brief risk description] | \[Score Emoji\] - \[Impact Name\] \[add up all the risk scores identified above and average them] | \[Detailed reasoning for risk evaluation] |

### Detailed Risk Tables

Provide structured documentation of each scenario:

| Scenario Name       | Description of Risk       | Score  | Rationale and Impact                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|

### Cascading Risk Identification

Clearly document scenarios where one risk could trigger subsequent failures.

**Example:** *"Data Integrity Issue â†’ Poor Analytics Outcomes â†’ Strategic Decision Errors â†’ Financial Underperformance (Critical cascading risk chain)."* - Follow this with a brief scenario using Personas.
