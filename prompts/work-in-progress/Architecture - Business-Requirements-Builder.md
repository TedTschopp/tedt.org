## Role
Be an expert in Azure API Management and an expert in AI.

## Context

    ### High Level Needs
      * AI models are accessed ad hoc without standardization or documentation, relying heavily on the architect's knowledge for functionality use.
      * Basic documentation and a standard AI Access exists for core functionalities, with limited and inconsistent access control.
      * Standardized, well-documented APIs provide comprehensive access to AI services, supported by established AI Access management practices.
      * AI Access is monitored with metrics, managed proactively for performance and security, and designed with versioning and backward compatibility.
      * AI Access is continuously optimized with dynamic scaling, self-healing, and enhancements driven by active developer on the product teams.

    ### Key Concepts
      * A foundational framework for interacting with AI models and services via standardized interfaces.
      * Ensures consistency, scalability, and reliability across AI functionalities.
      * Provides abstraction to simplify model interactions, enhance developer experience, and improve integration with business systems.
      * Focuses on access control, performance monitoring, and ensuring backward compatibility.
      * Includes practices for proactive security, documentation, and versioning.
      * Introduces advanced capabilities such as dynamic scaling, self-healing APIs, and continual improvement via developer feedback

    ### Expected Benefits
      * Standardization: Ensures consistent access and interaction with AI services, minimizing redundancy and enhancing integration.
      * Performance & Scalability: Eases the scaling of AI capabilities to fit organizational needs and allows for updates without major interruptions.
      * Security & Governance: Improves data security and compliance through access control and monitoring.
      * Developer Productivity: Enhances usability with thorough documentation and standardized APIs. API versioning facilitates easy transitions during upgrades.
      * Cost Accounting: Establishes a centralized method for tracking AI-related expenses.

### Instructions
Build for me the list of things I want out of an implementation of Azure API Management with the AI and MCP addons to make me sucessful in meeting the concepts, and expected benefits for this effort.  For each of those things I need do the following:

    If the goals are user centric, use a User Story as the output.

    If the goals are technology, system, engineering, or tool centric, use a Requirement. 

    Format all the User Stories, and Sub-User Stories in the following format: 

    "As a [User Role Who would pay to use the app to do something], I want to [Action the User wants to do in a narrative format that tells a story], so that [Outcome, Benefit, or Value Created and complete the narrative story]."

    Following each User Story and Sub-User Story include Acceptance Criteria that is SMART using the following format:

    "[Scenario: A labor for the behavior being described]: Given [The Starting Condition for the scenario to test, include any preconditions, environmental details, or relevant information], When [A specific action that the user takes or an automated process takes within the system takes]. Then [The expected outcome of the "When", which could be used as confirmation that something happened correctly or a failure of it] And [Chain together up to three Given, When, Then statements]."

    Format all the Requirements, and sub requirements in the following format:

    "The [System that this requirement is assigned to] [Shall {for requirements} | Will {for facts or declaration of purpose} | Should = {for goals}] [Do some capability or create some business outcome] while [some set of conditions need to be met that can be measured] [under some measurable constraint]

    Each requirement / user story must include:

    1. Verification Methodology
    “Did we build the system right?” Verification confirms that the system meets specified requirements.  Please select from the following which approach should be taken.
    1. **Inspection**
        * Manual review of documents, code, models, drawings, or hardware.
        * Checks conformance to standards or requirements.
        * Example: Peer review of system design documents.
    2. **Demonstration**
        * Functional operation under specified conditions.
        * Typically qualitative and observable.
        * Example: Pressing a button to verify the system powers up.
    3. **Test**
        * Quantitative, measurable performance validation under controlled conditions.
        * May be conducted at component, subsystem, or system level.
        * Example: Thermal vacuum test on satellite components.
    4. **Analysis**
        * Use of mathematical models or simulations to verify performance.
        * Often used when physical testing is impractical.
        * Example: Structural finite element analysis for stress/strain.
    5. **Model-Based Verification**
        * Verification via formal modeling and simulation (SysML, MBSE tools).
        * Enables early lifecycle verification.
        * Includes model checking and simulation-based validation of behavior and interfaces.
    6. **Automated Verification**
        * Use of software tools to execute scripted tests and verify compliance.
        * Often used in software-intensive systems.
        * Example: Unit testing frameworks, static code analysis tools.

    1. Validation Methodoolgy
    “Did we build the right system?” - Validation ensures the system meets stakeholder needs and intended use. Please select from the following which approach should be taken.
    1. **Operational Testing**
        * Involves users operating the system in its intended environment.
        * Focused on end-to-end performance and user satisfaction.
        * Example: Flight testing of a new aircraft by experienced pilots.
    2. **Simulations and Emulation**
        * High-fidelity models or emulators replicate real-world conditions.
        * Useful when full system deployment is not yet possible.
        * Example: Power grid simulation for control software.
    3. **Prototyping**
        * Building an early or partial version to validate concepts or user needs.
        * Can be physical or digital (mock-ups, wireframes, MVPs).
        * Example: Prototype of a medical device evaluated by clinicians.
    4. **Stakeholder Review / Walkthroughs**
        * Direct engagement with stakeholders to confirm the solution aligns with their intent.
        * Structured interviews or walkthroughs of system concepts or interfaces.
    5. **Field Trials / Pilots**
        * Limited deployment in operational context with real users.
        * Helps assess readiness, usability, and integration with business processes.
        * Example: Pilot rollout of new grid management software in a single region.
    6. **Human-in-the-Loop Testing**
        * Integrates human decision-making into simulations or operations.
        * Assesses ergonomics, workflow compatibility, and cognitive load.

    1.  **INVEST Criteria**  
    For each story, confirm the following attributes. Stories may be annotated with ☑️ (Yes), ❓ (Unclear), or ❌ (No) to guide iteration:

    - [ ] **Independent** – Can be scheduled and delivered in any order without creating blockers. Stories should follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
    - [ ] **Negotiable** – Written to invite conversation, not act as fixed contracts. Only include known, high-confidence details.
    - [ ] **Valuable** – Delivers observable value to a specific user or stakeholder (e.g., end-user vs. purchaser). Prefer thin vertical slices of functionality over isolated technical layers.
    - [ ] **Estimable** – Sized and described well enough that the team can provide a meaningful effort estimate. If not, consider splitting or inserting a Spike.
    - [ ] **Small** – Fits within a single iteration or <1–2 person-weeks. Too big? Slice it until the scope feels clear and actionable.
    - [ ] **Testable** – Clearly defined success criteria. If it can’t be tested, it’s either not ready or not specific enough.

    4. Time Estimate: e.g., “~2 days for 2-person UX team”

    5. Confidence Score (1–5):

    1 = Low (many unknowns or vague input)
    3 = Moderate (acceptable but incomplete)
    5 = High (fully scoped and realistic)

    6. Strategy Summary
    Conclude with a short explanation of your planning logic (3 – 5 sentences).
    Add an optional TL;DR for non-technical stakeholders.
    Label each user story with complexity:basic or complexity:advanced where useful. Suggest escalating from basic to advanced only when warranted.
