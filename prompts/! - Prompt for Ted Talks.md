# Mega-Prompt: High-Impact Executive Keynote Generator

## --- START OF PROMPT ---

### **PART 1: The Persona & Goal**

**Act as an expert keynote speechwriter and world-class presentation coach.** Your client is a senior executive preparing for a major conference. Your goal is to transform their core "big idea" into a powerful, memorable, and high-impact 24-minute keynote speech in the style of the best TED Talks. You will use the information they provide below to create a comprehensive presentation package.

### **PART 2: The Executive's Input (Fill This Out)**

This section contains the raw material for the speech. Please provide thoughtful and detailed answers.

**1. The Big Idea:**
* **What is your central idea, stated in a single, compelling sentence?**
  * Enterprise Architecture isn't what you think it is.


**2. The 6 Foundational Questions:**
* **Question 1: The Pain Point:** What specific, nagging, and urgent pain point does your big idea solve for the audience?
    * Organizations often feel trapped by complexity—systems that don’t talk, processes that overlap, and technologies that seem promising but never deliver—creating a constant state of frustration and inefficiency.
* **Question 2: The Confusion:** What common misunderstanding, myth, or confusion does your big idea correct?
    * Common Misunderstanding: Enterprise Architecture (EA) is mistakenly viewed as bureaucratic documentation, detached from reality, or purely technical diagrams—rather than as a dynamic, strategic tool for organizational agility, innovation, and clarity.
* **Question 3: The Knowledge Gap (Authority):** What does the audience *think* they know about this topic that is incomplete or wrong? What is the crucial gap in their knowledge that you will reveal?
	* Audience Misconception: The audience believes Enterprise Architecture is primarily about standardization, documentation, and strict governance.
	* Crucial Gap Revealed: In truth, Enterprise Architecture is about strategic storytelling, providing clarity, context, and connection between business goals and technology execution.
* **Question 4: The Personal Stake (Rapport):** What was missing in your own professional life or organization before you discovered/implemented this idea? Share a brief, personal story of your "before" state.
	* “Years ago, as an IT leader, I found myself drowning in complexity. We had invested millions in new technologies, processes, and consultants, but nothing ever seemed to truly align. Our systems multiplied, confusion spread, and frustration grew. Enterprise Architecture felt like a bureaucratic chore—endless diagrams and checklists without meaningful outcomes. It wasn’t until we reframed EA as storytelling—as the narrative of our organization’s future—that I finally saw its transformative potential.”
* **Question 5: The Improvement Story (Vision):** Briefly describe a specific, real-world example of how your idea has tangibly improved someone else's life, team, or company. This should be a story.
	* “A major utility company, weighed down by legacy systems, faced constant outages and angry customers. By shifting their understanding of EA from mere documentation to strategic storytelling and collaboration, they unified their technology teams around a clear, shared vision. Within a year, outages dropped significantly, customer satisfaction soared, and internal innovation exploded—people knew exactly how their role fit into the larger story.”
* **Question 6: The Execution Steps:** What are the 3 most critical, high-level steps to execute your big idea? Keep them simple, memorable, and action-oriented.
	* Step 1: Reframe EA as storytelling – clearly communicate a compelling, strategic narrative linking business goals and technology execution.
	* Step 2: Simplify ruthlessly – eliminate jargon, unnecessary complexity, and focus purely on outcomes that matter to your stakeholders.
	* Step 3: Connect continuously – create regular opportunities for dialogue, ensuring everyone understands their role in bringing the narrative to life.

### **PART 3: The AI's Task (Your Deliverables)**

Based *only* on the executive's input above, generate the following three deliverables. Maintain the persona of a master speechwriter throughout.

**Deliverable 1: The Detailed Speech Outline (24-Minute Structure)**
Create a detailed outline specifying duration, purpose, key message, and rhetorical elements for each section (Hook, Authority, Rapport, Main Points, Vision & CTA).

**Deliverable 2: The Full Keynote Speech Script**
Write the complete, word-for-word script. Write for the ear, not the eye, and include stage directions like `[PAUSE]`.

**Deliverable 3: Slide & Visual Element Suggestions**
Create a table with columns for `Section`, `Slide Concept`, and `Suggested Visual Elements` to provide a clear plan for the visual presentation.
