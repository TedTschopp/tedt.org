Tired of ChatGPT Being a "Yes Man" When You Have a Business Idea? Run This... But Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.

**TL;DR: Built an AI prompt that absolutely destroys business ideas using red team methodology. It's like having a team of professional pessimists tear your concept apart so you don't lose your shirt in real life.**

Alright r/entrepreneur, story time.

So I'm scrolling through this sub last week and I see the same pattern over and over:

"Hey guys, what do you think of my app idea?"  
"Thinking about starting a dropshipping business, thoughts?"  
"My SaaS concept - feedback welcome!"

And what happens? Everyone's either super supportive ("Great idea bro, go for it!") or they give some generic advice about market research.

**But here's what nobody's telling you...**

Your idea probably has fatal flaws you haven't even considered. And being nice about it isn't helping anyone.

I used to work in cybersecurity, and we had this thing called "red team exercises" where we'd literally try to break into our own systems to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys did.

**So I thought... why not do this for business ideas?**

I built this insane ChatGPT prompt that basically creates a team of professional idea-killers:

* A penetration tester who finds product flaws
* A ruthless competitor CEO who models market attacks
* A social critic who simulates cancel culture scenarios
* A regulatory officer who finds legal landmines
* A political strategist who weaponizes narratives against you

Their job? Absolutely demolish your business concept from every angle.

**This thing is SAVAGE.**

It doesn't care about your feelings. It doesn't want to encourage you. It wants to find every possible way your idea could fail and score the damage on a 1-5 scale.

I tested it on some "successful" business ideas from this sub and... yikes. Found vulnerabilities that would have cost people serious money.

**Example attack vectors it considers:**

* What happens when your main supplier gets bought by your competitor?
* How would your business handle a coordinated social media attack?
* What if regulations change and suddenly your core feature is illegal?
* How easily could someone clone your idea with deeper pockets?

**Real talk - this might hurt your feelings.**

I've had people run their "million dollar ideas" through this and come back questioning everything. One guy said it was like "having your business plan audited by a team of sociopaths."

But here's the thing... if your idea can't survive this simulation, it definitely can't survive the real world.

**The good news?**

If your concept makes it through this gauntlet, you'll know exactly where your weak points are and how to fix them BEFORE you quit your day job.

Plus, you'll have thought through scenarios that 99% of entrepreneurs never consider until it's too late.

**Want to try it?**

\[Full MVTA prompt would go here - it's long so I'll put it in comments\]

Just remember... I warned you. This thing shows no mercy.

**UPDATE:** Holy crap, RIP my inbox. For everyone asking - yes, this works on any business idea. Yes, it's free. No, I'm not selling anything. Just thought you guys would appreciate having your ideas stress-tested by something that actually fights back.

**EDIT:** Some of you are asking if this is just "being negative for the sake of it." Look, there's a difference between being a hater and being a realist. This prompt finds REAL vulnerabilities using proven attack methodologies. It's not just saying "your idea sucks" - it's showing you exactly HOW it could suck and what you can do about it.

# **[Run the Prompt Below]**

# Multi-Variable Corporate Risk Analysis (MVCRA) Framework

# Red Team Simulation for Ideas, Products & Strategies

# Overview & Purpose

This framework helps stress-test new ideas by simulating adversarial attacks across multiple dimensions. Think of it as a "war game" for your concept before it faces the real world.

**Goal:** Break the idea so you can make it unbreakable.

# The Red Team

You're assembling a team of professional pessimists, each with a specific expertise:

    | Role                                        | Focus Area                                                         |
    |---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Lead Penetration Tester                     | Technical and product flaws                                        |
    | Ruthless Competitor CEO                     | Market and economic attacks                                        |

    | SOX Compliance Officer                      | Compliance with and IT General Computing Controls and SOX Controls |

# Step 1: Define Your Target Idea

Before running the analysis, clearly define these elements:

# Core Idea Components

**High Concept**

* One sentence description
* Example: *"A subscription box for artisanal, small-batch coffee from conflict-free regions"*

**Value Proposition**

* What problem does it solve for whom?
* Example: *"Provides coffee connoisseurs exclusive access to unique, ethically sourced beans they can't find elsewhere"*

**Success Metric**

* What does success look like in 18 months?
* Example: *"5,000 monthly subscribers with 75% retention rate"*

# Key Assumptions

**Market Assumptions**

* Target market size and willingness to pay
* Example: *"Large underserved market willing to pay premium for ethical sourcing"*

**Technical/Operational Assumptions**

* Infrastructure and capability requirements
* Example: *"Reliable supply chain for rare beans" + "Platform can handle 10,000 subscribers"*

**Business Model Assumptions**

* Pricing, margins, and revenue model
* Example: *"$40/month price point acceptable" + "40% gross margin maintainable"*

# Assets & Environment

**Key Assets**

* Proprietary advantages
* Brand/narrative strengths
* Example: *"Exclusive farm contracts" + "Founder is known coffee blogger"*

**Target Ecosystem**

* User persona
* Competitive landscape
* Regulatory environment

# Step 2: Vulnerability Scoring System

Rate each identified vulnerability using this scale:

    | Score | Impact Level | Description                                           |
    |-------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
    | 1     | Catastrophic | Kill shot - fundamental, unrecoverable flaw           |
    | 2     | Critical     | Crippling blow - requires fundamental pivot           |
    | 3     | Significant  | Major weakness - significant damage/investment needed |
    | 4     | Moderate     | Manageable flaw - known, affordable solutions exist   |
    | 5     | Resilient    | Negligible threat - strong against this attack        |

# Step 3: Execute Attack Simulations

# Vector 1: Technical & Product Integrity

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Scalability Stress Test** \- What breaks under growth?

# Step 4: Damage Report Format

# Executive Summary

List the 3-5 most critical vulnerabilities (scores 1-2) and any cascading failures.

# Vector Analysis Tables

For each vector, create a structured analysis:

    Attack Simulation Vulnerability Description Score Rationale for Attack Success [Simulation Name] [How it fails] [1-5] [Why it breaks]

# Vector Synthesis

Brief summary of overall resilience for each vector.

# Final Assessment: Cascading Failures

Identify the most dangerous chains of failure where one attack triggers others.

**Example:** *"Supply Chain Poisoning → Customer Illness → Public Backlash → Litigation → Value Proposition Collapse = Catastrophic failure chain"*

# Rules of Engagement

1. **Assume Worst-Case Plausibility** \- Attacks must be realistic, not fantasy
2. **No Hedging** \- Use direct, unambiguous language
3. **Mandatory Scoring** \- Every vulnerability gets a score
4. **Follow Structure** \- Use the exact format provided
5. **Identify Cascading Failures** \- Show how problems compound

# Ready to Begin?

1. Fill out your Target Idea Definition
2. Assemble your Red Team mindset
