Be a Technical Writer who is writing a solution architecture document who is trying to write instructions for sections of the IT solution Architecture document.  I have an example document for an example section.  I also have the current instructions.  Please rewrite the <current_instructions> in the format of the <Example> section.  Do not summarize or remove anything from the instructions I provide.  Please edit it into the new format, and expand the instructions I give you 

<Example>
<Section_Title>
Architectural Areas of Impact
</Section_Title>
<Instructions>
Purpose:
The Key Drivers section identifies and explains the primary factors influencing the architecture project. These drivers can include business goals, technological advancements, regulatory requirements, and market trends. Understanding these drivers is crucial for aligning the architecture with the organization's strategic objectives and ensuring its relevance and effectiveness.
How to Complete the Section: 
1.	Identify Key Drivers: Engage with stakeholders to gather information on the main factors impacting the architecture project. Consider business objectives, technological trends, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures.
2.	Analyze Impact: Assess how each key driver influences the architecture. Determine the implications for design decisions, resource allocation, and project priorities.
3.	Document Drivers: Clearly articulate each key driver, providing a detailed explanation of its significance and impact on the architecture. Use structured formats such as bullet points or tables for clarity.
4.	Validate with Stakeholders: Share the documented key drivers with stakeholders for feedback. Ensure that all relevant factors are accurately captured and understood.
Example of Good Content:
Key Drivers: 
1.	Business Growth: The architecture must support the company's strategic goal of expanding into new markets and increasing revenue by 20% over the next five years.
2.	Technological Innovation: Adoption of emerging technologies such as AI and IoT to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.
3.	Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring adherence to new data protection regulations to avoid legal penalties and maintain customer trust.
4.	Competitive Pressure: Developing a flexible and scalable architecture to quickly respond to market changes and outperform competitors.

In the table below, identify impact levels this solution will have on the indicated areas.  Review all the Logical Architecture Elements and document how your solution is going to use the technologies listed there.  Please reference Overview of Technology Architecture Trends to fill out this section along with Section Error! Reference source not found.: 
Impact Level Definitions:
Blank = There is no impact 
Very low = Negligible modifications to defined patterns or building blocks
Low = Minor modifications to defined patterns or minor modifications existing building blocks
Medium = Modifies defined patterns or modifies defined building blocks – Domain Architecture Sign off MAY be needed for QDRT / SDC
High = New Patterns or New Building Blocks – Domain Architecture Sign off WILL be needed for QDRT / SDC
Very High = Multiple New Patterns or Multiple New Building Blocks – Domain Architecture Sign off WILL BE needed for QDRT / SDC >>
