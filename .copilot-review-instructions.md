# Code Review Guidelines

Use this checklist when reviewing pull requests for the Jekyll / GitHub Pages site.

---

### 1. Build & Deployment
- [ ] Does the site build locally without errors using `bundle exec jekyll build`?
- [ ] Are any new plugins GitHub Pages‚Äìcompatible (no unsupported gems)?
- [ ] Does `_config.yml` still render production URLs correctly?

---

### 2. HTML & Liquid
- [ ] Are all Liquid tags and filters valid (`jekyll serve` logs clean)?
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs where `{% link %}` or `{% asset %}` should be used.
- [ ] Frontmatter is present and properly formatted (`title`, `date`, `layout`).
- [ ] Includes and layouts follow naming and structural conventions.

---

### 3. CSS & JS
- [ ] CSS changes use site variables (colors, fonts, spacing).
- [ ] JS avoids inline scripts in HTML templates.
- [ ] Scripts are deferred and scoped properly to prevent layout shift.

---

### 4. Accessibility & SEO
- [ ] Images include meaningful `alt` attributes.
- [ ] Headings follow a logical hierarchy (`h1 > h2 > h3`).
- [ ] Meta descriptions are present for new pages.
- [ ] Links use descriptive text, not ‚Äúclick here.‚Äù

---

### 5. Content & Style
- [ ] Markdown renders correctly; no broken syntax.
- [ ] Writing style matches site tone (clear, accessible, consistent).
- [ ] Dates, categories, and tags follow existing conventions.
- [ ] Internal links point to canonical `/page/` URLs (no `.html`).

---

### 6. Approval & Merge
- [ ] Two reviewers minimum for design or content changes.
- [ ] One reviewer minimum for small fixes or typos.
- [ ] Squash and merge after all checks pass.
