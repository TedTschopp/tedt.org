  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them. A visible crustean looks like a brown and black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs and very large, powerful claws.">

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them. A visible crustean looks like a brown and black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs and very large, powerful claws.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them. A visible crustean looks like a brown and black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs and very large, powerful claws.">

Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them. A visible crustean looks like a brown and black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs and very large, powerful claws.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time.

Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them.

They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time.

If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time.

Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time.

Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached.

However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above.

When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.

A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

  <meta property="og:description" content="hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts, although they understand other creatures' desire for them.

  <meta property="og:description" content="The hideous result of an accidental overexposure to radiation,Gallus Gallus 5/13 is a living abomination to Man's technology. This mutated chicken species is malignant to the core and seeks to dominate all other creatures.The superior mental ability of this mutant makes it a cunning and deadly foe.These creatures are quite adept at figuring out the workings of technological items,and within their own physical limitations are skilled at using the artifacts created by the Ancients. For some unknown reason every Gallus Gallus 5/13 has a Complete Mental Block against Companion Units.These mutants appear fat and squatty,and are covered with patchy yellow-orange feathers.Their exposure to radiation in the lab has left these mutant chickens with two very bizarre features;one beneficial and the other a defect.Instead of having two eyes,Gallus Gallus 5/13's possess one large central green eye (Body Structure Change).This unfortunate defect means that these mutants lack depth perception,and must fight in melee with a -1 penalty "to hit"and when using ranged weapons with a -2 penalty "to hit."Their former wings have been transformed into thin stubby feathered arms with hand-like appendages (New Body Parts). These newly acquired "hands,"although only having three fingers, are what permit the Gallus Gallus 5/13's to manipulate artifacts and weapons.Probably their most effective mutation of all, and the one used with great cunning,is their Chameleon Powers for this allows them to often attack without first being seen by their victims.

  <meta property="og:description" content="The hideous result of an accidental overexposure to radiation,Gallus Gallus 5/13 is a living abomination to Man's technology. This mutated chicken species is malignant to the core and seeks to dominate all other creatures.The superior mental ability of this mutant makes it a cunning and deadly foe.These creatures are quite adept at figuring out the workings of technological items,and within their own physical limitations are skilled at using the artifacts created by the Ancients. For some unknown reason every Gallus Gallus 5/13 has a Complete Mental Block against Companion Units.These mutants appear fat and squatty,and are covered with patchy yellow-orange feathers.Their exposure to radiation in the lab has left these mutant chickens with two very bizarre features;one beneficial and the other a defect.Instead of having two eyes,Gallus Gallus 5/13's possess one large central green eye (Body Structure Change).This unfortunate defect means that these mutants lack depth perception,and must fight in melee with a -1 penalty "to hit"and when using ranged weapons with a -2 penalty "to hit."Their former wings have been transformed into thin stubby feathered arms with hand-like appendages (New Body Parts). These newly acquired "hands,"although only having three fingers, are what permit the Gallus Gallus 5/13's to manipulate artifacts and weapons.Probably their most effective mutation of all, and the one used with great cunning,is their Chameleon Powers for this allows them to often attack without first being seen by their victims. Unknown to all these mutant chickens is their lack of resistance to poison of any type.Poison is instant death to the Gallus Gallus 5/13 unless the correct antidote is immediately administered. Even then there is only a 50% chance that the mutant will live.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="Radiation Zombies are survivors" of the apocalypse, usually found sealed away in ancient structures or underground complexes where they have dwelled mindlessly for many, many years. These survivors" are not truly alive anymore, but kept animated through the radiation which killed them. For some unknown reason they have an urge to kill and eat any living thing which they encounter. They are usually easy to avoid if encountered, as they are very slow moving and practically non-intelligent. However in close confines or in large numbers they can be quite dangerous.Though their insatiable hunger is horrific, it isn't the most feared thing about radiation zombies... it is the deadly radioactivity they carry with them.

  <meta property="og:description" content="Ba'mutan are gentle herbivores that have evolved into extremely large, well-defended creatures.  They resemble a copper colored armadillo with a dragon's head.  They can grow up to 30 feet in length, and they are over 12 feet tall.  They are primarily nocturnal and thus almost completely blind in the daylight.  However their hearing is excellent and can get around with just that sense.   Ba'mutan have large shells that can conceal the formation of a "land pearl".  A little less than half of the Ba'mutan out there have these pearls.  There is no way to determine if a given Ba'mutan has a pearl outside of killing it and spending four days extracting it from its shell.   Because of this, over time the Ba'mutan who were solitary creatures have become extinct and the only surviving creatures are herd animals.  This means that groups of these creatures will be found together and attacking one to extract its pearl will cause the whole herd to panic and attack.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="Garrels are agile mam- mals of reasonable intelligence that have developed several special skills to foil predators.

Garrels prefer forests with a thick blanket of undergrowth so that they can lose pursuit with a minimum of effort.

If both of the previous powers have been used and the garrel is still in danger, it will then attack its pursuer, biting with its sharp teeth and never relenting.">

It will then use its teleport object ability to gain possession of the item and will then return to its lair, most often a hollow tree trunk or a small burrow, where the garrel will put the item with the others it has accumulated.If a garrel is attacked, either by a predator or by angry beings whose equipment has been borrowed," its first reaction will be to flee, holding any treasures it has acquired for as long as it can, using its speed, agility, tree-climbing skills, and any available foliage to speed its escape. Garrels prefer forests with a thick blanket of undergrowth so that they can lose pursuit with a minimum of effort. During the chase, the garrel will trust its displacement ability to send it to safety if it is at any time in imminent danger of being killed.If displacement cannot be used, the garrel will then use its stunning force to buy time. Garrels are immune to the effects of another garrels stunning force attack. If both of the previous powers have been used and the garrel is still in danger, it will then attack its pursuer, biting with its sharp teeth and never relenting.">

Unless freed, a snared victim will suffer 2 dice of damage each round until it dies;at which time the dead creature is fed into the mutant tree's mouth opening.

The three shortest Squeeze Vines each take turns plucking these fruit off the branches and hurling them at opponents.Only one such "missile" can be tossed per melee round and is always thrown at a penalty of -2 "to hit." A distance of 30 meters can be reached by anyone single toss.Once picked,the fruit explodes in 10 seconds and causes 3-18 (3d6)points of damage to all creatures caught in its one meter radius area of effect.The Tarn Zeb is a vicious opponent, but it knows that it is a solitary being and will retreat if it feels overly threatened after engaging its opponent or opponents in battle.">

Found at the under the base of the mutant, between its four "feet," is a hollow mouthy opening where the squeeze vines insert dead human-sized or smaller creatures that are to be eaten and digested.Strong "Aromatic Powers," effective up to 10 kilometers, lure creatures of all kinds toward the Tarn Zeb in the hopes that these victims will come close enough to become ensnared in the Squeeze Vines. Three of the Squeeze Vines per round can each do 2- 12 (2d6) points of damage. Unless freed, a snared victim will suffer 2 dice of damage each round until it dies;at which time the dead creature is fed into the mutant tree's mouth opening. Another attack form the Tarn Zeb possesses is its exploding yellow fruit. The three shortest Squeeze Vines each take turns plucking these fruit off the branches and hurling them at opponents.Only one such "missile" can be tossed per melee round and is always thrown at a penalty of -2 "to hit." A distance of 30 meters can be reached by anyone single toss.Once picked,the fruit explodes in 10 seconds and causes 3-18 (3d6)points of damage to all creatures caught in its one meter radius area of effect.The Tarn Zeb is a vicious opponent, but it knows that it is a solitary being and will retreat if it feels overly threatened after engaging its opponent or opponents in battle.">

Found at the under the base of the mutant, between its four "feet," is a hollow mouthy opening where the squeeze vines insert dead human-sized or smaller creatures that are to be eaten and digested.Strong "Aromatic Powers," effective up to 10 kilometers, lure creatures of all kinds toward the Tarn Zeb in the hopes that these victims will come close enough to become ensnared in the Squeeze Vines. Three of the Squeeze Vines per round can each do 2- 12 (2d6) points of damage.

A distance of 30 meters can be reached by anyone single toss.Once picked,the fruit explodes in 10 seconds and causes 3-18 (3d6)points of damage to all creatures caught in its one meter radius area of effect.The Tarn Zeb is a vicious opponent, but it knows that it is a solitary being and will retreat if it feels overly threatened after engaging its opponent or opponents in battle.">

Found at the under the base of the mutant, between its four "feet," is a hollow mouthy opening where the squeeze vines insert dead human-sized or smaller creatures that are to be eaten and digested.Strong "Aromatic Powers," effective up to 10 kilometers, lure creatures of all kinds toward the Tarn Zeb in the hopes that these victims will come close enough to become ensnared in the Squeeze Vines. Three of the Squeeze Vines per round can each do 2- 12 (2d6) points of damage. Unless freed, a snared victim will suffer 2 dice of damage each round until it dies;at which time the dead creature is fed into the mutant tree's mouth opening. Another attack form the Tarn Zeb possesses is its exploding yellow fruit. The three shortest Squeeze Vines each take turns plucking these fruit off the branches and hurling them at opponents.Only one such "missile" can be tossed per melee round and is always thrown at a penalty of -2 "to hit." A distance of 30 meters can be reached by anyone single toss.Once picked,the fruit explodes in 10 seconds and causes 3-18 (3d6)points of damage to all creatures caught in its one meter radius area of effect.The Tarn Zeb is a vicious opponent, but it knows that it is a solitary being and will retreat if it feels overly threatened after engaging its opponent or opponents in battle.">

In a random manner, it will use one of the following attacks (roll1d4, one attack for one action turn):1) inflict 3d10 heat damage up to 3 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it; 2) fire an electrical bolt doing 2d26 damage up to 10 m from the blossoms flower stalk, in the direction of the thing that touched it;3) fire an energy-draining bolt that instantly reduces all power cells within 5 m of the blossom to half energy; or,4) energy negation activated for 2-20 action turns, within a 15 m radius. If the spores ever kill the creature who touched the plant, they will grow in the dead body and become 1-3 new blaster blossoms within three days.">

                The following is a collection of writings collected in the library of Haven regarding other Archaic Alignments.  The city of Haven has either not encountered these alignments or they describe non-canonical understandings of known alignments.  The person who contributed this work to the library, Gene, said he acquired this work from the bodies of what he would only describe as some alien like mutants he had never seen before.  As time permits the scribes at this library will integrate this information with the above texts as it is validated.</p>
