                The following is a collection of writings collected in the library of Haven regarding other Archaic Alignments.  The city of Haven has either not encountered these alignments or they describe non-canonical understandings of known alignments.  The person who contributed this work to the library, Gene, said he acquired this work from the bodies of what he would only describe as some alien like mutants he had never seen before.  As time permits the scribes at this library will integrate this information with the above texts as it is validated.</p>
