Content creation guidance:
- Start every post with proper frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `categories`, `layout: post`).
- Use Markdown headings hierarchically (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Include relevant tags and categories for navigation.
- Use absolute links via `{% link %}` to prevent broken paths.
- Keep tone consistent: informative, friendly, concise.
