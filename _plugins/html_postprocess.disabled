# html_postprocess plugin removed
# This file intentionally left as documentation only. The original html_postprocess.rb
# If a file named html_postprocess.rb reappears in this directory, investigate automation
# (scaffold generation, template sync, or merge) that is restoring it. No post_render
# mutations are desired now; keep output deterministic.
# has been deleted to prevent any post_render HTML mutation (duplicate img alt attributes, etc.).
# If reintroducing functionality, prefer explicit Liquid template logic or site build-time
# data preparation instead of regex-based post-render rewrites.
