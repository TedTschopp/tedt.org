Description: The N'thlai are three meters tall, have two long barbed, triple-jointed
  legs, and have four two-meter tentacles extending from a barrel chest.  At the end
  of the tentacles are eight-digit hands that they use with complete dexterity.  Their
  head is heart-shaped, cleaved down the middle.  On the right and left sides of their
  head are 60-cm long comb feelers, similar to those found on moths.  In addition,
  around their heads are clusters of multiple optical organs.  At the bottom of their
  face is a huge circular orifice that serves as a moth.  Inside are thousands of
  writing, worlike tongues and flat, grinding ridges used for chewing.  They suck
  up munched protine through ta hollow tongue.

Behavior: The feelers and "eyes" combine to give the n'thlai radar/sonar and 360 degree
  sight.  They can not be surprised. Vegetarians, Nature Worshippers, Healers, Comando
  Fighters.
