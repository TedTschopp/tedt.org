Mission: To save human lives and prevent or minimize property damage in the event
  of a natural disaster, such as fire, flood, earthquake, industrial accident, explosion,
  plane crash, etc.
Description: The top of this oval robot looks like a serving plate.  A smooth mass
  of metal hangs down a full meter below this concave area.  Two 2-meter-long retractable
  tentacles are mounted along the edges.  It floats on antigrav pods.  It uses a calm,
  smooth female voice for victims, anda bold, authortative male voice for bystanders.

Reactions: Common ID Cards can only be used to dir3ect a disaster robot to the disaster
  scene or away from it once its job is done.  This ability includes limiting the
  robot's activities to a particular portion of a disaster, under the assumption that
  other robits or people are handling the rest.  The robot is required to respond
  to a civil authority card, which can make it stop rendering aid or direct it to
  a new quadrant.  Secity cards are obeyed even if the orders endanger property and
  human life.
Behavior: Upon arriving at the scene, the robot spends a few rounds questioning observers,
  if any, while searching for signs of life.  It then determines the most effective
  course of action to save the most lives.  Only after all lives are accounted for
  willit concern itself with preventing property damage.  Each person located is placed
  on the robot's upper surface and weak force field encloses them.  Fresh air is pumped
  in and emergency medical treatment is rendered if necessary.  The robot carries
  each reduced individual to safety and then gives and gets the next one.  Medical
  care is not given once the victim is safe from the disaster scene.  The robot will
  politely, but forcefully, remove looters or other dangerous individuals from the
  scene, using a stun ray or screamer.
