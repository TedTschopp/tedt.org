Mission: ''
Description: The water crep has a pink flower and lives submerged in freshwater lakes
  and swamps. Surrounding the plant's bulbous flower is a mass of strong, leafy vines.
  The crep can move about (slowly) on its thick, flexible roots, seeking better "hunting
  grounds". The crep's vines are mobile and quite dexterous (although the plant is
  largely blind, and not very intelligent).

Behavior: Yexils are slow witted, but friendly.  Their size and ability to loose a
  laser blast from their eyes (per laser rifle) discourages predators.  Yexils are
  immune to cold attacks.  They eat manufactured clothing of all types and find synthetics
  especially tasty.  In fact, the snappier the outfit, the better yexils like the
  taste.  They will often trade 'useless' artifacts for 'food' of this type.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Crep plants feed on other living creatures using their Life Leech mutation.
  They generally trap a creature with their tendrils, then drain its life force. The
  crep uses the drained life force to seed, dropping off mobile seeds that burrow
  into the ground to become new crep plants. Crep uses their tendrils the defend themselves
  and ward off predators. In desparate situations they use their Death Field mutation
  for defense.
Society: Crep are found in still freshwater, along shores, and in moist, temperate
  climates. They migrate slowly, killing off local animal life and leaving a "trail"
  of crep seedlings in their path. Immature crep plants grow rooted for a season before
  gaining mobility and moving off on their own in search of prey.
