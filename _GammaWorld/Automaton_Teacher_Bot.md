Mission: Be a companion and tutor to humans.  The Automaton is designed to be a companion
  and tutor to humans. All were given a strong unwillingness to harm humans in any
  way; however, an Automaton can cause minor harm to humans as in lessons that need
  to be learned if the lesson is ultimately beneficial to the human.
Description: Automatons are two-meter-tall robots made of metal and plastic. Automatons
  were given humanlike features to make students and owners more comfortable
Equipment: An Automaton possesses the equivalent of a small library of incormation
  in crystalline memory housed in its leg and chest units. It may be questioned for
  information as complex as Tech V, on events up to 100 years before the holocaust,
  and any- thing within its own personal history.1 x searchlight1 x loudspeaker50
