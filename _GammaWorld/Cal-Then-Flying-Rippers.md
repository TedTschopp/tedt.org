Description: An obb or 'flying eye,' looks vaguely like a bat-winged creature about
  a meter long, with a large, central eye between its 'shoulders' and a pair of clawed
  limbs. Its surface is dead black and covered in short, soft fuzz. Although it's
  mobile and resembles an animal, the obb is actually a mutant form of fungus.

Behavior: The Cal Thens is immune to heat and cold.  They feed on bone marrow and
  will rip through anything, even duralloy, to get at fresh bones.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Cal then are predators that attack nearly any creature smaller than them (including
  humanoids). They often swoop down to attack, remaining on the ground while they
  fight. They attack with their mandibles and only retreat when they are badly wounded.
Society: Cal then tend to be solidary creatures, claiming a particular area as their
  hunting ground. Their diet consists primarily of the bones of their prey, and they're
  known for tearing off flesh and discarding it to crush and devour the bones. Their
  method of feeding tends to attract scavengers and other creatures to a cal then's
  hunting ground to feed on the leftovers. They are sometimes encountered in mated
  pairs, but mate only briefly. The female lays a clutch of eggs, but does not care
  for the young.
