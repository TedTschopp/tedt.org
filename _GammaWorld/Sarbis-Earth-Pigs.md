Description: The sarbis looks strikingly like a 2-meter-tall bipedal aardvark. Its
  body is covered with coarse yellow to gray fur, and its face is dominated by a long
  snout. The hands, while manipulative, end in powerful claws good for digging and
  fighting.  Sarbises can be found in almost any terrain except the coldest. Their
  settlements or camps invariably signal the presence of minerals, for the sarbis
  are passionate miners. The camps are a mixture of above and underground constructions.
  Sarbises are paranoid that others (especially other sarbis) might try to "claim-jump"
  their diggings, so most camps are well defended with stockades and guard towers.
  Attack is made doubly difficult since the ground outside the camp is broken by jagged
  heaps of tailings.  Sarbises rely on trade for food, clothing, and other interesting
  goods. In exchange, they sell refined minerals ingots of pig iron, copper, lead,
  tin, nickel; bags of sulphur, salt, and coal; whatever is useful from the earth.
  Because few others have the talent to dig and smelt these needed metals, sarbises
  are often left unmolested, even in the most hostile territories. Each camp is ruled
  by a strong man, a single leader who achieved his position through bullying and
  threat. All trading in the camp is controlled by the strong man or his minions.
  Sarbises will often buy artifacts useful to mining, sometimes offering other artifacts
  or to make useful implements in exchange.
Equipment: Sarbis have been known to employ a rare tech level 3 item along with their
  more common tech level 2 devices and weapons.  They seldom wear any clothing or
  armor, usually just gear for holding or carrying provisions and devices.

Behavior: Sarbis usually establish large above ground mining camps.  There are very
  well protected by the huge amount of slag the Sarbis mine and dump out around the
  camp, making it almost impossible for a direct charge of any type.  They also construct
  tall guard towers around the area to oversee the area and guard the access roads
  from the camp to any other establishments there and the outside world.  Sarbis are
  notorious traders, having to rely heavily on the outside world for food (primarily
  meat or insects) for any comforts.  They are particularly fond of large insects
  for food and prefer Skyzorr'n above all others.

New_Description: The Sarbis are a race of humanoid aardvarks.  Though they walk erect
  and are more human-shaped than their quadrupedal ancestors, they still are unmistakably
  aardvarks - complete with claws at the end of their arms and legs (though the hand
  / claes are now somewhat manipulative), a long snout, and extremely powerful body.  The
  Sarbis are usually miners, though they live above ground in human-type dwellings.  They
  do not use digging tools, as their extremely power claws are all they need to burrow
  deep beneath the earth.  To this same end, they have evolved a directional organ
  which always lets them know where they are in relation to north.  Their heightened
  senses are particularly effective underground and they are impossible to surprise
  once they enter caves, tunnels, or any other dark subterranean environments.
Combat: While not especially warlike, their proverbial stubborn attitudes and amazing
  strength make them formidable opponents.  Once a Sarbis has dug its claws into the
  ground (taking a stand), physical strength of 121+ is needed to move them.  It takes
  large machines or teams of animals to move a Sarbis.
Society: Sarbis form large communities called "camps."  There is always one dominate
  male who rules the camp.  As previously mentioned, Sarbis are usually miners and
  provide much of the raw minerals for Gamma World societies.  There value in this
  capacity, plus their dangerous nature when crossed, have made them better allies
  than slaves or subjects.
