Description: Intelligent humanoids that have adapted to living on both land and in
  the water.  The fen is a 2 meter tall humanoid fish with both lung and gills (similar
  to a prehistoric lungfish). It has pearly white, almost translucent, flesh and scales
  and can walk (slowly) on land on its stubby legs. It has hands able to crudely manipulate
  objects (including weapons).

New_Description: fan are intelligent humanoids who are adapted for living on boch
  land and water. They possess fish-like tails, stubby legs, and both lungs and gills.
  They can remain out of water for as long as 24 hours. If they do not return to a
  watery environment at that time, they lose 1d6 hit points each additional hour until
  they submerge. While in their standard form, fens wear fish in armor, giving them
  the AC bonus of studded leather ( + 3 AC). Fens can shapechange into a bird of their
  own size and weight twice per day. This allows them to escape both aquatic and land
  based predators with ease. While in their bird form, fens can only fly at a movement
  rate of 24. They cannot accelerate to a higher speed as a normal bird can. It takes
  two rounds for a fan to change from one form to the other. When a fan shape changes,
  equipment worn or carried does not become part of the bird form.
Combat: The fan has several natural attack forms at its disposal. While in its standard
  man-fish form, it can use its tail to slap an opponent standing behind or to its
  sides for 4d6 points of damage. It can also attack with any weapon it might have.
  The fan also can use any weapon that does not require fine manipulation, since its
  fingers are heavily webbed. In its bird form, the fan has three attack forms that
  it may direct at only one opponent during a single ground of  It can buffet with
  its wings for ld6 points of damage per wing, and it can peck with its beak for 2d6
  points of damage.Fens can only remain out of water for 24 hours at a time. They
  emerge from the water singly and in small groups to scavenge things from the land,
  particularly ancient artifacts and other useful trinkets, and they're not adverse
  the stealing things they want. Fen can't bite, but they can strike with their strong
  tails and wield weapons. They're mistrustful of surface creatures.
Society: When in water, fens live in a society they call a lyceum. These lyceums swim
  together then whole lives, hunting during the early dawn and dusk. Basically omnivores,
  they eat both the flora and the fauna living at the sea or lake bottom. Fens are
  most prevalent in coastal areas and near large lakes. They are basically friendly
  and harmless, desiring only to live and let live.  Fens retreat back to the water
  when they are outnumbered by surface creatures.
