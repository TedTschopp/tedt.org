Description: The narl ep resembles any of a myriad of conifers; pine trees, spruce,
  evergreens, etc. It cannot move and cannot attack at any distance, but has various
  mutations that allow it to kill prey close by, which then decomposes and provides
  nutrients for the tree. The usual form of attack for anything close to the nep ep
  is to grab or trip it with the roots, hoping it will, in its struggle to break free,
  either brush against the contact poison sap or come within range of the tree's electrical
  discharge. The roots extend out in a 7m radius from the trunk, so the aromatic power
  can easily lure prey within range of the roots.

Behavior: The tree can absorb and store electricity over a period of time (electrical
  storms, etc.) then release it when desired. This electrical discharge has a range
  of 3m from the tree's branches (5m from the trunk) and cause 4d10 points of base
  damage depending on the size of the tree (GM's decision).  The nep ep also has unique
  boring tendrils that only activate from the roots when and item with a lot of energy
  is dropped or left under the tree. The tree senses this power and bores up under
  and through the item, draining it of its energy. Therefore, there are usually some
  items of an electrical short under the tree, usually buried beneath the fallen needles.
  The GM should determine these items randomly; the number of items found is 1d6.
  There is only a 25% chance any item is in useable shape, it will have a small hole
  bored into it and will always be drained of all power. Even those items beyond repair
  may still be scavenged for parts or as curiosities.
