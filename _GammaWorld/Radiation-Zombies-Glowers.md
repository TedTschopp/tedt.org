Description: Radiation Zombies are survivors" of the apocalypse, usually found sealed
  away in ancient structures or underground complexes where they have dwelled mindlessly
  for many, many years. These survivors" are not truly alive anymore, but kept animated
  through the radiation which killed them. For some unknown reason they have an urge
  to kill and eat any living thing which they encounter. They are usually easy to
  avoid if encountered, as they are very slow moving and practically non-intelligent.
  However in close confines or in large numbers they can be quite dangerous.Though
  their insatiable hunger is horrific, it isn't the most feared thing about radiation
  zombies... it is the deadly radioactivity they carry with them. Each group of radiation
  zombies will be contaminated with 3d6 Intensity radiation. This will be uniform
  for each individual within the entire group. Any contact with a radiation zombie
  will require an immediate check on the radiation table to determine the damage caused
  by the radioactivity.
