Behavior: The true, unmutated water bear (tardigrade) looks the same, but is much
  smaller (.005 m long at most) and is missing some organ system. But both have an
  amazing ability, they can last up to 30 years without water. It just seems to wither
  up and collapse in on itself, but just giving it some water and it will walk away
  unharmed. Water bears only defend themselves, never attacking. They just try to
  waddle up and ram the aggressor, if moving away does not work. Many undersea races
  farm water bears for food. It is almost to the point of cattle, but water bears
  can live in the wild without supervision.
