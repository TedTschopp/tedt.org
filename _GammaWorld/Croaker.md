Description: This mutated descendant of the Cane Toad looks much like its ancestor
  It is brown to yellow-brown, with prominent cranial crests, and a somewhat round,
  flattened body outline. It also retains the poison producing paratoid glands of
  its unmutated predecessor.Croakers are not the bravest creatures in the world. They
  are small, and therefore not able to inflict much damage on larger creatures. When
  faced with larger creatures, they prefer to use their mutations to remain hidden.
  If they are spotted, they will use their Stunning Force mutation and attempt to
  escape if at all possible. If left with no option but to fight, they will bite and
  attempt to rub their bodies (which are coated with a contact poison) on any exposed
  flesh they can find on the enemy creatures.Croakers band together in groups for
  mutual protection and for breeding. They spawn year-round with suitable temperature
  and rainfall. Eggs are laid in long-standing water - ditches, canals, streams, and
  ponds.
