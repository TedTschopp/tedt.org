Description: This ovoid is sent by the Manhunter to track and hunt down crea- tures
  that attempt to escape by fleeing into a watery environment. Some versions of this
  cyber have camouflage detectors that cause fish and creatures using camouflag- ing
  mutations to appear normally for attack purposes.This cyber is covered in a plastic
  water- proof covering. It is also equipped with two spear rifles that have a range
  of 50 meters and have two spears each, coated with a substance that causes sleep
  for 4d10 action turns (characters drown in 2d4 action turns unless rescued or taken
  by the cyber). The underwater drone is also capable of leaving a thick black fog
  of chemical for 10 meters around itself in the water. This allows escape and obscures
  the vision of creatures in the area for 2d8 action turns. The cyber has sonar sensors
  that detect creatures up to 200 meters away.Four small, high-explosive, heat-seeking
  torpedoes (weapon class 16) can be launched, each having a range of 200 meters and
  do 4d6 hp damage each. The cyber is also equipped with an ultra-pow- erful light
  that blinds characters looking directly at it for 1d6 action turns out to 30 meters.
  The cyber has a tractor/pressor beam capable of lifting and carrying up to 200 kilograms.
