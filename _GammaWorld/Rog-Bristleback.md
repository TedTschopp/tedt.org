Description: Rogs, the most common meat and domesticated animal in Meriga, are descendants
  of the pig. They hold the same place in the farming community that cows do in our
  time. Roughly the same size as a normal pig, they have elongated snouts, similar
  to an anteater, but not as long as an elephant. They have a mane of fur that grows
  over their necks and shoulders and down the ridge of their spine. They suffer from
  periodic amnesia, although most farmers just assume that they are stupid. The milk
  from a rog is slightly sweet and very nutritious. Its skin and fur can be made into
  cloth.
