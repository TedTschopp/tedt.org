Description: The horl choo is an odd black plant that looks like a lumpy porcupine
  with long quills, about a meter in diameter with quills about a meter long, it's
  also known as the "spiny" or "spear-thrower" plant. It can move with a slow, shuffling
  motion and usually does so only at night, seeking better hunting grounds. Although
  it has no visible eyes or ears, a horl choo can sense heat (notably body heat) and
  has a rudimentary sense of touch (but no other senses).

Behavior: This plant is covered in 1 meter line spear like quills that it can fling
  up to 30 meters.  Each quill is tipped with I9 poison and is attached to the plant
  with a tough, thin vine that the plant uses to retrieve missed quills and impaled
  prey.  Once the prey is pulled back in it will start to dissolve it with its acid
  attack.  A Horl Choo will continue to attack creatures with its spines as it attempts
  to pull its prey in.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Horl choo are capable of flinging their spines as weapons up to a distance
  of 40 meters (10/20/40 range). The spines are tipped with a hemotoxin and connected
  to the horl choo by thin, tough fibers, allowing it to reel in impaled prey to its
  root cluster, where digestive acids break it down into food for the creature. A
  horl choo bristles and flings its spines when threatened as well, and is capable
  of "dropping" spines (releasing the fiber connecting them to its body) in order
  to flee.
Society: Horl choo aren't intelligent by most standards, they're just hunting machines.
  They spore once per year, using slain prey to host the spores where a young horl
  choo will grow over the course of a few weeks before shuffling off on its own to
  hunt.
