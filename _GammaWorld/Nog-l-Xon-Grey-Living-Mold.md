Description: A Two Meter cigar-shaped quadruped with 4 five-meter loing tentacles
  sprouting from the top.  Grey lving molds look like bizarre clay-like horse/octopus
  symbiot.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: If destroyed, and sealed in an airtight container, and left for a month,
  it will decompose into a liter of oil that can be spread over a 10 meter area.  This
  oil is so slippery that every creature that tries to cross it must make a Dex Check
  and -4 or slip and fall.  Once fallen in the oil, it is impoosible for a character
  or creature to regain his footing on his own, although crawling is possible at 1/10th
  normal movement rate.  This oil is water-resistant, but can be washed off with alcohol
  or other cleaning agents.  One nogI'XON makes 1 liter of this oil.
Behavior: I'Xon have a new Sense Mutation.  They are symbioticly linked with their
  host.  They are immune to most forms of attack.  They take half damage from Fire
  (not heat).  Cold Attacks do double damage to them.  They are immune to chemical
  defoliants.
