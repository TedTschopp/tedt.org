Mission: ''
Description: hese solitary, omnivorous scavengers can be encountered in a wide variety
  of places, as indicated above. In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps,
  their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They
  generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most
  of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When
  encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans
  are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are
  generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely
  and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans
  enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible
  nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time
  friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and
  sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically
  climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between
  the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both
  claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect
  (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes
  a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least
  16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try
  to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above.
  This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a
  crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back". A crustean forcibly
  removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were
  attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until
  at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with
  great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However,
  the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light
  Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their
  shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and
  claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely
  vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its
  breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not
  be encountered in deep water. Crusteans have no interest in treasure and artifacts,
  although they understand other creatures' desire for them. A visible crustean looks
  like a brown and black mottled crab about the size of a derby hat, with long legs
  and very large, powerful claws.
