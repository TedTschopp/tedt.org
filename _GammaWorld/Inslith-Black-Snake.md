Description: An Inslith is a long, thin, black snake with a plastic-line skin, strong
  teeth and an acidic bite.  Inslith eat plastic, rubber, and metal and for that reason
  prefer to live inside machinery or electrical conduits.  Though the damage of its
  bite is relatively weak, the inslith has daws and teeth that are well-adapted for
  gnawing through plastic and metal pipes as well as cables and wire.  The inslith
  secretes a strong acid saliva that aids in the digesting the material it eats.  The
  snake can also spit this acid at enemies.  The snake stores a small amount of acid,
  and it can make this ranged attack every 5 actions.
Equipment: Inslith do not collect items and will have no treasure.  However, when
  found here is a 15% chance that the nest contains two eggs.  Inslith eggs resemble
  black, crystalline rocks.  They will brack on contact with anything warm, sending
  shards flying witin a 1 meter radius (1d2-1) Damage.  The baby snake inside is harmless
  at this stage, an unbroken egg is valuable to hunters.  What is more valuable is
  the skins that the sinslith shed in their nest.  Every month the inslith grows a
  new skin and discards his own in the nest.  There are 1d12 skins in a nest for each
  inslith that lives there.  A shed skin can be made into armor by any hunter with
  a roll against Agility DC 15.  It requires 100 skins to make a set of armor for
  a human sized creature.  The armor will be AC 4 and includes a helm, but not a shield.  The
  armor is acid proof.

New_Description: These vaguely centaur-like creatures are two meters in height and
  live in mountainous regions, using natural or artifical-exacated caverns for shelter.  Equinoids
  have an extremely strong sense of cultural identiy.  Their young are kept isolated
  from all 'contamination' by non-Equinoid thought and ideas; any spies or inflitrators
  caught within their caverans are immediately executed.  Except for this protectionists
  attitude regarding their young, Equinoids are generally friendly to other races.
Combat: Due to the snakes natural camouflage when in its usual enviroment, when a
  character first looks into a conduit or machine the only way he can tell if a black
  cord is really a snake and not a normal electrical cord is by making a sucessful
  INT at -2 vs 17
