Description: Though primarily nocturnal, these large quill-covered mammals occasionally
  venture out into the daylight in search of tasty grubs or insects.  Spinies are
  large mutated porcupines that grow up to two meters in length. They are slow-moving,
  preferring to climb a tree or use their quills to defend against predators.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Spinies generally shy away from contact with humanoids, though if encountered
  near their den, they can be ferociously protective. If they are in a position to
  flee, they use Fatigue Generation to slow pursuers; otherwise, they slap opponents
  with a quill-covered tail, leaving d6-2 quills embedded with a successful attack.
  Removing a quill causes d4-2s.
Society: Most spinies are solitary, creating dens in hillsides or under fallen trees.
  Males and females come together to mate in autumn, after which the male remains
  to protect the pregnant female in her den. Young are born in late spring and the
  male leaves soon afterward.
