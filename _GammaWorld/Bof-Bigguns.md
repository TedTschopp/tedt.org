Description: Bofs are 2.5 meter tall buffalo who walk on their two hind legs that
  end in hoofs.  Their hands have 4 fingered hands with thumbs.  Their heads and shoulders
  are extremely hairy. Their hands are somewhat less hairy, while their torso and
  leg are smooth skinned.

Reactions: ''
Behavior: Bufs are extremely stubborn, mercenary in all their dealings, and not to
  be trusted unless the financial aspects of the dea are worked out in their favor
  in advance.  Bofs develop family units they call herds, of an alpha male, and 4
  to 5 beta males.  The herd will then consist of a couple dozen females and their
  young.  Young males, who are kicked out of their herd sell their services until
  they are old and experienced enough to attract females and start their own herds.  A
  bof may show loyalty to an individual who has saved his life; this will override
  all thoughts on double crossing the person that saved them.
