Description: Each worm is between .25 and 1 meter long and is bright red in color.  They
  are encased in a mineral and metallic sheath around them.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: These worms absorb the minerals and metals emitted by the vents they live
  near and so have iron and zinc based "teeth" used to kill prey (this can rip through
  some metals). They still use the bacteria that their deeper dwelling cousins use,
  but now also add fresh meat when available. They build a case out of the metals
  captured from the vent(s) and only come out to feed or to collect more nutrients
  from the hot water.  The hot water they dwell in inflicts between d6 and 6d10 points
  of damage depending on the temperature (190 F to 600 F) and the protection the diver
  has.  When a worm retreats inside its sheath it has an AC increased to 5.
