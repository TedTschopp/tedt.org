Description: Sea Monkeys are a generally peaceful group of creatures. They are very
  curious however and will watch or follow anything out of the ordinary with great
  interest. This includes adventurers who travel through their areas. In fact, Sea
  Monkey are so curious that after the initial observation period is over, they will
  actually come right up to the thing which has held their attention for a better
  look (if it doesn't seem too dangerous). Once in close proximity, they become very
  playful and mischievous - taking items, throwing small objects, making a chaotic
  ruckus as they move rapidly in an out of reach. If harmed they will fight back by
  scratching or biting. They cannot survive out of water.
