Description: Slippigs resemble the pink, curly-tailed porkers of the pre-holo- caust
  era, but they are completely hairless. They are, of course, frequently attacked
  by carnivores, and their only effective defense lies in running away. They use their
  speed increase only when they can- not outrun a pursuer any other way. They are
  expert dodgers and almost never tire. However, they are no more intelligentthan
  an ordinary pig, so they can be trapped, or hunted and cut off by an expert team
  of hunters (GM may judge the effectiveness of hunting strategies). It is also possible
  to surprise a slippig and kill it with a single powerful attack before it has a
  chance to run.Slippigs secrete a very slippery oil similar to Kinetic Nullifier
  Fluid, which covers their entire bodies at all times. Any physical blow does only
  half damage to a slippig, since the sword, paw, or whatnot slides off on any roll
  except a 20. Any sort of grabbing maneuver (including a bite with a mouth of any
  size) causes the pig to spurt out of the clutches of its attacker, giving it a full
  Action Turn head start while its pursuer gets up or looks around for it again.As
  slippigs are basically herbivorous, they are often attacked, poisoned, radi- ated,
  or infected by plants. A slippig seri- ously hurt by poison, radiation, or disease
  is easy to catch, but dangerous to eat. Only the considerable fecundity of slippigs
  has enabled them to survive as a species.
