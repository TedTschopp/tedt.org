Mission: ''
Description: The plague beetle is a giant scarab. It is 1 meter long and has almost
  perfect chameleon abilities (in fact, it can not turn it off). It is a scavenger
  that uses disease to kill its food (like a Komodo dragon). They are not violent,
  and will only use the disease when their food supply is in major decline.

Behavior: Plague beetles run from violence, only attacking if defending food. If they
  encounter weak or massed animals, they emit the bacteria they kill with. It is released
  via spiracles in a cloud 15 meters in diameter. This cloud leaves a residue that
  lasts 4-5 days. Those in the cloud must make a Con check (at -2). Failure means
  death in 2-5 days. Each beetle can emit this cloud twice per day. Healers can cure
  this disease fairly easily- all they need is access to "standard" medicines (GMs
  decision).Plague beetles live in small egalitarian groups. When they attack a town,
  each beetle picks a suitable target - inns, taverns, granaries, town halls, and
  other places where people or food is concentrated. Then each uses the bacteria to
  wipe out most of the town. After the survivors flee, the Beetles feast. They then
  go back to scavenging in the wilds, if possible.GMs are urged to use this critter
  sparingly, as you can depopulate large areas with these!
