Description: This fearsome mutant bear usually lives in isolated forest regions. It
  travels on all fours but if need be it can stand on its hind legs. While standing
  up the barxyn can use weapons of all types with its front paws at -2 to hit. This
  creature is very large, 2 and a half meters at the shoulders and almost 5 meters
  when standing fully erect. Although larger, it is much sleeker than its unmutated
  predecessor.It is a fierce hunter and will attempt to kill almost any creature.
  The barxyn has razor sharp teeth and claws with which to attack its opponents. The
  dark brown partial carapace protects the barxyn's head and shoulder area from most
  attacks, giving the creature an Armor class of 4. Large purple buglike eyes project
  deadly radiation at opponents when the barxyn is angered.Evolving over the years,
  this mutated bear has developed fur that is multicolored brown, yellow, and green
  in patches. When hungry, the barxyn delight in burning trapped creatures out of
  their hiding places with Pyrokinesis powers (hence the name, Smokie)
