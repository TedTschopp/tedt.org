New_Description: Dabbers are highly intelligent, mutated racoons who walk upright.
  Their manipulative hands have opposable thumbs, allowing human-like manipulation
  of objects. Dabbers wear human clothing of all types, including boots and shoes.
  They maintain the raccoon face and mask, giving them a startling appearance.
Combat: Dabbers sometimes carry Tech Level III and IV equipment and weapons. Occasionally,
  they even known how to use them (20% ). When dabbers fight, they use their Repulsion
  field mutation to ward off small projectile weapons. They use their telekinesis
  to lift the items to their hands. Their illusion generation is particularly strong.
  They can muster up visions of warbots or horrible monsters to scare their opponents
  off when they are at a combative disadvantage. Their telepathy and empathy give
  them a tremendous advantage when dealing with their opponents. They are almost impossible
  to ambush. As a rule, they engage in combat only to acquire fun little baubles or
  in self-defense if cornered.
Society: abbers are found in small, family-oriented groups. These groups, in turn,
  are only a small section of a larger clan. These clans, or cities, consist of up
  to 100 dabber families. Dabbers are intrigued with anything shiny. If they see another
  creature with an object, they approach cautiously, asking for it. If turned down
  nicely, the dabber leaves distraught, but understanding and accepting that the object
  is cherished by its current owner. If turned away cruelly, the dabber runs away.
  Often (90% of the time), the dabber then comes back with up to seven friends to
  take the object, and anything else that strikes his and their fancy.
