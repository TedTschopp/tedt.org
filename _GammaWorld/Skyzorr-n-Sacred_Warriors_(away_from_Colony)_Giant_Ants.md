Description: ''
Equipment: Skyzorr'n usually use Tech Level II devices and weapons, except for the
  sacred warriors which often have Tech Level III weapons.
Reactions: ''
Behavior: The Skyzorr'n have a rigid class structure that is kept intact by the physical
  descriptions, abilities, and purposes of each level. Sacred warriors are elite fighters,
  guardians of the queen, and are sometimes sent on sacred missions, such as revenge.

New_Description: Skyzorr'n are mutated giant ants that walk erect, have large mandibles
  they use as tools or weapons, and have four arms (all controllable at once to some
  degree). Skyzorr'n can be found almost anywhere except cold climes;  they are constantly
  sending scouts and explorers out to bring back information on possible new areas
  to colonize. Skyzorr'n are most often encountered in forests, the tropics, grasslands,
  and underground, but can go anywhere their interest takes them.
Combat: All Skyzorr'n have Sarbis phobia, a dreaded fear of the Sarbis race (probably
  an ancient race memory of ant-eating aardvarks). When a Sarbis appears on the scene,
  Skyzorr'n will operate at a - 3 CS penalty (or at - 30, whichever is appropriate).
Society: No other race gets along well with the Skyzorr'n; they are fierce, warlike
  beings who believe it is their destiny to one day rule Gamma World. They belong
  to no cryptic alliances and owe allegiance only to their own race and destiny. This
  does not mean that they are isolationists; the Skyzorr'n frequently trade with merchants
  and other races for the treasure their queen desires. Skyzorr'n peons or warriors
  are often hired out as guards or workers in exchange for payment. This also gives
  the queen a way of gaining information and keeping track of the activities of other
  societies.
