Description: Seps are mutated sharks that have fully adapted to life on land and are
  no longer suited for living in the water. The Snow Seps are adapted to living in
  the Snow and Ice and are only found in arctic conditions.  The Sep has an organ
  in their brains that pushes and packs snow and ice pack out of its way allowing
  it to swim forward below the surface.

Reactions: ''
Behavior: Once a Sep has swum under its prey it will leap into the air snapping their
  victim in their jaws and pulling them underground.  A Sep will tend to strafe a
  their prey until they have either killed and pulled the group under or they have
  killed all their prey.  Seps can sense motion and sound up to 60 meters away.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Seps can sense vibrations on the surface up to 50 meters way and usually spring
  suddenly from the snow and ice to bite prey their their powerful jaws. They can
  just as quickly dive back below the surface, circling around for another attack
  from a different direction. Once killed, the prey is dragged below-ground and eaten.
Society: Seps tend to hunt singly, although they're sometimes encountered in small
  "schools" of up to six. They inhabit deserts and other sandy regions.
