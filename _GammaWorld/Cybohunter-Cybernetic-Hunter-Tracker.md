Description: 'Cybohunters are the weakest and most common of all known Hunter robots.
  They were used to track down dangerous enemies, such as escaped prisoners and fugitives
  during the Social Wars. They track fleeing characters using special sensors, and
  kill with all of the special weapons and functions at their command. Once a mission
  has been de- tailed by a character with a Stage IV I.D. or a cybernetic installation
  (or some other ancient command area), the Cybohunter tracks immediately, ignoring
  any further attempts by any force to command it, until itself or the objective is
  destroyed. A Cybo- hunter only destroys its objective (and any creature or being
  that tries to interfere or stop its function in any way), not harming those that
  do not cross the Hunters path.The Cybohunter appears as a massive 5- meter tall
  humanoid. It is silver and con- structed out of a very thick duralloy compound.
  The head contains a horizontal band of black glass, through which shines a moving,
  glowing red light  its eye. The tracker has various antennae on the out- side of
  the helmet that constantly move and act as the sensors. The remaining shape of the
  body is basically human in appearance, in larger proportions, with various indentations
  and protrusions used for holding and storing equipment and weaponry.This unit is
  equipped with a great vari- ety of powerful offensive and defensive features. Any
  and all of these features may be used at the same time, as with any Hunter-class
  robot.The Cybohunter generates an electrical damage field that does 3d10 hp damage
  to anyone who touches it. This includes those who hit it with metal of any sort,
  but no damage occurs to characters protected by a force field of any sort (the force
  field takes 5d10 hp damage per contact).The Cybohunter is capable of command- ing
  all nearby robots as if it were carrying a Stage V I.D. It can control any of the
  robots listed in the GAMMA WORLD game that were not made for offensive purposes
  up to a distance of 200 meters away; ro- bots that are no longer controlled or that
  leave the 200-meter area revert to their former instructions and command. Offen-
  sive robots (Death Machines, Warbots, and Security Robots) stay out of the Cybohun-
  ters way but do not obey its directions. The robot is equipped with a force field
  that can absorb up to 100 hp damage per action turn.The Cybohunter has been partially
  fitted with powered assault armor that covers areas not needed for combat. This
  armor gives the unit the structural capability to lift and support enormous weights
  (de- pending on each individual unitsstrength). Jumps of up to 30 meters are possible
  and can be made once every action turn.The Cybohunter generates an electronic- disruptor
  field that overloads all energy circuits not within a 5-meter diameter surrounding
  the unit itself. This field affects equipment and energy-using weap- ons up to a
  distance of 50 meters; there is a 25% chance that the item is able to with- stand
  the effects of this field. These de- vices become overloaded and their circuits
  fuse, totally destroying them.As combat is the Cybohunters main reason for existence,
  a great deal of its equipment is devoted to the task of de- stroying opponents.
  One of the Cybohun- ters main modes for accomplishing this is hand-to-hand combat.
  The powered fists do 9d6 hp damage. All attacks made in non-weapon combat are made
  at an addi- tional 1d6 hp damage to the damage listed, due to its microscopic sensors.
  The fore- arms of the Cybohunter have slots on the outsides that allow large blades
  to be extended or contracted. These arm blades do 5d6 hp damage and may possibly
  hit the character if the powered fist attack misses (roll twice during the same
  action turn for each fist; the first roll is to hit with the fist and the second
  roll is to de- termine if the blades hit). Attached to the back of the wrists of
  each hand are dural- loy claws which can be used much as the natural attacks of
  mutated animals are performed, causing 4d8 hp damage. The claws can be retracted
  or used in conjunc- tion with the arm blades (as explained above).The legs of this
  unit are capable of dis- charging an adhesive paste compoundalong a ridge on the
  outer surface of the leg. This paste does not effect the Cybo- hunters attack ability
  but may be used to hamper a characters movement. Charac- ters that come near or
  in contact with the legs have an attack made on them using the Cybohunters normal
  roll to hit. If this attack roll is successful, then the victim is stuck to the
  duralloy leg and can be auto- matically hit by any weapon. The charac- ter can escape
  only by the greatest effort (roll Physical Strength  4 or less on per- centile dice),
  which causes 2d4 hp damage to the victim whether successful or not. There are a
  total of 10 doses of adhesive paste that can be used for this attack. The paste
  is automatically removed when the character is freed or dead, using another chemical
  stored in the legs that causes 2d6 hp damage (acid burn) to characters that again
  come in contact with the robot. This acidic chemical evaporates in two action turns,
  and the adhesive attack is again possible afterwards.For ranged combat, the Cybohunter
  has a large selection of highly efficient attacks. Fitted into the index finger
  of each hand are independently powered laser pistols. The laser pistols do 5d8 hp
  damage and have a range of 90 meters. Each is pow- ered by two hydrogen energy cells
  that allow each pistol to make 20 shots before needing to be recharged.Attached
  to the right arm of the Cybo- hunter is an independently powered laser rifle. This
  rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen
  energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered
  crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical
  energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types:
  an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding
  tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area.
  The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of
  the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The
  micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also
  constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range
  of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter
  has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed
  of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand-
  ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can
  be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the
  weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured
  victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must
  roll their dexterity or under on ad20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this
  entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater
  is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters
  to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters.
  As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler
  fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been
  thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped
  with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender
  is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered
  by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged
  by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted
  into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to
  direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted
  with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has
  a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of
  radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical
  or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over
  time). At- tacks using mental powers can be made normally on the Cybohunter.'
