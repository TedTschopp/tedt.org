Mission: ''
Description: This white tree looks like a banyan and grows to the height of 60m.  The
  narl ep or "ghost tree" is a mutant form of White Swamp Oak that grows in or near
  slow-moving water. The tree's smooth bark is completely white and its leaves are
  a pale green. During the spring its branches are covered in nut-like seed pods.

Behavior: The narl eps network of roots extend out 30 meters around the trunk.  They
  float on the water and lay on the mud until disturbed.  When they are disturbed,
  they will leap into the air and attack their prey.  In the spring, these roots will
  be covered with seedpods, which they will fling away from the tree.  Once the husk
  around the seed rots away, the pod will burst with a sonic blast that will blast
  the seeds away from the pod up to 10 meters.  Anyone caught in the blast will be
  hit for 6 points of damage.  Pods can be found up to 120 meters from their tree.  While
  they are not rotten, they can be picked up and taken to be used as natural grenades.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Narl ep's whip-like branches are prehensile and sensitive to heat and movement.
  They attack anything that attempts to harm the tree, otherwise remaining motionless.
  The slain bodies of would-be predators serve as additional fertilizer for the tree,
  and their bones are sometimes found stuck among its roots (adding the the narl ep's
  fearsome reputation).
Society: Narl eps are always found close to water and local races quickly learn to
  leave them alone. This isn't difficult since the wood and bark of a narl ep is no
  more useful than that of any other tree. The only thing of value about them is their
  seeds. In late summer, the narp ep thrashes its branches to fling its many seed
  pods to the wind. When completely ripe, the pods burst open with a sonic blast,
  scatting a number of seeds to the wind. Since a sharp blow will crack a pod, some
  try to harvest narl ep seed pods for use as crude grenades.
