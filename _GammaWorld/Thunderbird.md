Mission: ''
Description: These great mutated bald eagles take their name from ancient human stories
  of giant birds that lived in hidden mountain lairs.  With a wingspan of over 20
  meters, these are the largest avian creatures known on Gamma Terra. They otherwise
  look much like their ancestors, with dark brown or black feathers and a white-feathered
  head. Their keening cry can be heard for miles around, and their talons can grasp
  and pick up a rakox with ease.

Combat: These magnificent birds generally leave their mountainous aeries only to hunt
  prey. They have no qualms about consuming intelligent beings, even humanoids, though
  stories tell of rare individuals who persuaded a thunder-bird to spare its life
  in exchange for stories or other knowledge of the world. Thankfully for their environment,
  the thunderbird's metabolism is surprisingly slow and it requires only infrequent
  meals. Those unfortunate enough to be targeted by a thunderbird as prey are subjected
  to a deafening screech and targeted by the creature's Mental Paralysis mutation.
  This usually serves to immobilize the bird's prey, which it then snatches up and
  takes back to its nest.
Society: Thunderbirds lead lonely lives, only coming together with others of their
  kind for mating. Once the young hatch, the male leaves the nest (and the area).
  A single thunderbird's territory can stretch for dozens of kilometers in all directions
  from its nest (usually nestled in a high mountain crag). It does not allow other
  large predators to hunt in its territory, taking on yexil, mantids, and even kamodos
  without fear.
