Description: These 6 foot long fish live only in large bodies of water, however, they
  are able to leap into the air and slide using their broad pectoral fins as wings.  They
  can spend an unlimited amount of time gliding, actually flapping their fins to gain
  speed and height.  However after 5 rounds they need to return to the water or they
  suffocate in the air.  Fleshins may shapechange into an gator at will and can maintain
  this form for as along as 24 hours.  While in this form, the Fleshins have the physical
  appearance and natural AC of an gator.  The tentacles they gain in the transformation
  use debilitative poison, though, not gator paralytic poison.  The fleshin is physically
  related to the flying dish, but its mind is far closer to that of the shark.  They
  tend to swim in small schools, hunting and marauding both above and below the water.  Unwary
  birds and dish of any size are common prey.  The scent of glood can bring fleshins
  from kilometers away.

Behavior: Fleshins are strictly carnivores, attacking anything and everything when
  they are hungry.  The scent of blood in the water can drive them into a feeding
  frenzy, initiated by a failed morale check when first scenting this blood.  If in
  a feeding frenzy, fleshins will attack until killed, ignoring morale.  They will
  attack targets up to 10 meters above the water, frequently with surpirse, by leaping
  out of the water and biting.  If their bite is successful, the automatically whip
  their back spines up into the target they have bitten.  The spines on their back
  and  flide fins are poisonous (Intensity 15 devilitative), but do only a single
  point of physical damage.  Aside from this surpise leap, the spines work as the
  quills or spines mutations.  If agliding attack results in a landing on dry land.  the
  fleshin shapchanges into a gator.  It may or may not head for the open water, depending
  upon the situation and whether or not it is subject to bloodlust at that moment.
