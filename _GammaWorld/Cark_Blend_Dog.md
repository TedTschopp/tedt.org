Description: Physically, these dogs appear to be normal and unmutated. However, over
  the generations, this type of dog has developed retractable claws, much like a cats,
  and their bodies are much more flexible than their ancestors, again, just like a
  cats. Only the larger breeds of dogs (Dobermans, German Shepherds, etc) have managed
  to survive to create this new breed. Wolf climbers have also been reported to exist
  in the Rocky Mountains and northern forests of Kanda.As with normal dogs, this breed
  uses simple pack tactics to surround, and bring down weakened prey, or solitary
  travelers. The main difference is the fact that they also will use trees to help
  them surround their prey. So if you are in a forest, and find yourself surrounded
  by a pack of these creatures, don't bother to climb a tree to escape. You'll find
  yourself staring down the maws of several of these animals.Just as a normal pack
  dog, these animals are lead by both an alpha male and alpha female. The rest of
  the pack is subservient to these, unless another male thinks it is strong enough
  to challenge the leader. Females tend to build dens high in large trees, ruins,
  or if nothing appropriate is available, in dens on the ground. The females give
  birth late in spring to litters of 2D4 pups. The pups, if caught at an early age,
  can easily be domesticated. Wolf climbers can not be domesticated however.

Combat: ''
Society: Rakoxen roam plains areas in large herds, grazing in groups of 20d 10. They
  are also found in many Tech Level II and III civilized areas, where they are used
  to pull wagons , plows, etc . Domestic rakoxen often have their horns saw down or
  capped by their owners. If sawn , the horns grow back in a season , requiring them
  to be cut again . Rakoxen are rarely ridden, since they tend to buck off riders.  In
  many places, older rakoxen are butchered for food. The meat is salty but otherwise
  palatable . The hide can be cured and used , but it is less serviceable than rog
  hide (see the 'Campaign ' chapter). The horns are hollowed out and made into musical
  instruments or storage containers , like gunpowder horns.
