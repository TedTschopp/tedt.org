Mission: ''
Description: Guman are only found underground as they cannot tolerate sunlight (solar
  energy(.  These paper-thin creatureds are extremely mobile, covered with strong
  cila, and can climb any surface.  They can stay perfectly still on any surface and
  alter their molecules to sink into the surface.  In this manner they become part
  of the surface while retaining their idenity and mental capacity.  This power is
  so effective that a character needs to be within a meter of them to automatically
  see them.
Equipment: Guman collect no treasure but often intelligent characters who have lived
  through guman mental control will suddenly find that they have a skill or talent
  they never had before.  Apparently guman carry around residual memories from other
  victims and these are someitmes transferred to new victims.

New_Description: ''
Combat: A guman notices all creatures coming into its area through its heightened
  hearing. A guman may attack with its mental powers without losing its ability to
  remain within the surface, even when it has taken over another body and left the
  area.  The gunman lives on thoughts and the brain's alpha waves, so they must mentally
  feed on other creatures.  For every 12 hours that a guman occupies a character's
  body that character's natural MS and IN will drop by 1.  Even if the guman leaves
  or is driven out, the MS and IN loss remain.
