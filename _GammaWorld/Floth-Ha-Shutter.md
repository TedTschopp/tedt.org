Description: Floth-Ha are mutated "common house" moths. They are virtually identical
  to their predecessors except for their extra front two limbs from which they can
  manipulate objects and also for their great size. (wingspan is an impressive 3m)
  Their bodies are covered in a fine fur, and for those who have seen a Shutter in
  flight, the underside is a palette of light browns. Due to the chameleon powers
  their back and wings poses, the natural coloring of these surfaces are unknown.
  Floth-Ha do have antenna but rely primarily on sonar to guide them.

Behavior: These creatures are herbivores and usually feed upon the bark of trees however
  the delicacy of cotton, wool, or even leather are too good to pass up. There have
  been numerous reports of unwary travelers who've been attacked only to have their
  clothes eaten from their bodies. The creatures methods are predictable, they will
  swoop from above and grab on with all 6 legs digging into the victim.(clinging)
  It's other 2 manipulative arms undo buckles, snaps, zippers etc. Survivors tell
  that once you get past the initial cling, the act of devouring the clothing is relatively
  painless. When the Floth-Ha is upon it's victim, it drapes it's wings over to completely
  engulf the victim. It's back and wings are it's primary defense, they are completely
  impervious to all forms of physical attacks, lasers and radiation type weapons,
  And since they have chameleon capabilities, it's extremely possible to not even
  see the actual attack on the ground.  Shutters are solitary animals and will only
  be in numbers of 2 during mating. They are attracted to heat and bright lights.
  The name "Shutters" comes from the unconscious twitching they display while they
  sleep clinging to a tree. This motion temporally negates their chameleon bonuses
  and makes them more easily visible. Of course when they cling in this manner they
  only expose their wings and back , protecting their soft underbellies.(AC of only
  5) When they cling in this manner, they cannot be forcefully removed, unless a well
  orchestrated combined PS of 40 is applied. Even in death, the creatures remain affixed.
  For obvious reasons, the Shutters' wings are very valuable in Gamma Terra, and will
  fetch the handsome price of 8,500 domars for just 1 of a set of wings.
