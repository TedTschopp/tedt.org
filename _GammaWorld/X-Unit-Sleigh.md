Description: 'This unit was originally designed to be a Small Cargo Transport. The
  modified unit has the following additions:  Two Separate Force Fields: 200 hit points
  each; the force fields operate independently of each other.  Electrified outer shell:
  Does 3d10 of damage to all those touching it. Although it normally operates with
  hand and foot controls, it does have limited audio control capacity and will obey
  simple directional commands. All units, including the laser weapons, are powered
  by broadcast power from the robot factory, giving units a range of 500 kilometers.
  The S. Reindeer will react to any physical attack with the flame thrower in their
  tails. Their mini-missiles are shot on the instructions of the X.M.A.S. unit. If
  the X.M.A.S. unit is destroyed, the X Unit Sleigh and remaining S. Reindeer will
  return to the factory at maximum speed. Although the X.M.A.S. unit is programmed
  to be jolly, it will not allow itself to get into situations where it can be easily
  destroyed.'
