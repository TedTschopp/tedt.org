Description: The parn or "sword beetle" is one of the deadliest predators of Gamma
  Terra. It's 3 meters long, with a hard carapace covered with sharp spines. It's
  spindly limbs are also spiny, but the parn earns its name from its long antennae,
  which are each tipped with two sword-like blades that it wields with frightening
  skill.

Reactions: ''
Behavior: The Parn may attack one per turn with each antenna.  The antenna each have
  10 hit points each, in addition to their normal hit points.  Players may target
  the antenna separately prior to rolling to hit.  They have the same armor as the
  parn itself.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Parn are vicious and relenetless hunters, stalking and killing any creature
  smaller than they. Small groups of parn (as many as four) can bring down much larger
  creatures. They attack with their antennae and fight to the death, never retreating.
Society: Parn tend to be solitary creatures. They mate only once per year, and the
  female lays her eggs in a buried nest before abandoning them to their fate. Most
  young parn don't survive the first few months of life. Those that do grow to maturity
  within a year.
