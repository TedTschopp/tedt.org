Status: 2 x RANKS
Mission: To accomplish assigned Military objectives, including, but not limited to
  the destruction of soldiers and materials of the enemy.  To defend the soldiers
  and materials of its base.  Its secondary goal is to avoid harming non-combatants.
Description: This vaguely turtle-shaped unit is 9 meters long by 6 meters wide by
  3 meters tall. It has 4 Micro-missile Launchers, 6 Torc Grenade Launchers (500 meter
  range and 5d20 Torc Grenades), 4 Black Ray Guns (200 meter range), 8 Mark VII Blaster
  Batteries of 3 guns each, 1 Matter Bomb Launcher 1200 meter range and 6d6 Matter
  Bombs) and 6 Laser Batteries of 5 guns each (1500-meter range and 15d6 damage per
  battery). All Warbots have a 200 Hit Point Energy Screen. They can use all weapons
  simultaneously.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: When encountered without an objective, dormant, or in storage, a military
  common ID card can be used to move a warbot from place to place or have it perform
  mental tasks.  Only a supervisor's card can give it a military objective.  maintenance
  ID cards work normally, assuming that they are from the same military base.  Programmer's
  cards cannot be used to make awarbot attack the base it is assigned to.  Only a
  security card can do that.  Warbots ignore civil authority cards.
Behavior: Some of a warbot's missions do not require it to destroy anything until
  its objective is reached.  Others require it to not be detected, so as to slip behind
  enemy lines.  In general, it ignores people unless they present the appropriate
  ID cards.  When on an assult mission, the warbot shoots firrst and examines ID cards
  later.  In the event of an attack upon tis base or upon itself, the warbot will
  fully activate and do whatever is necessary to drive off or destroy the attacker.  This
  continues until the attacker is no longer a threat, or until ti recieves orders
  from a supervisor or anyone with a security card.  This might prove to be difficult
  at present.
