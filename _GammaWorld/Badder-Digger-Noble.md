Description: 1.5 Meter-tall humanoid badgers. Badders wear chainmail and ring mail
  armor.  They walk erect.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: Badders are often of evil disposition, given to raiding their neighbors
  and gleefully engaging in wanton destruction.  They always have Tech Level 2 weapons.  There
  is a 10% chance they will have Tech Level 3 weapons.  Badders have a keen sense
  of smell, but are hard of hearing.  They speak in a snarling language, though some
  members of a society will speak trade languages.  A Badder village or steadings
  consist of underground earthen tunnel complexes containing 10d01 males of fighting
  age and their spouses, who will fight without weapons, and one child per female.  For
  every 20 Badders, there will be one noble.
Repair_and_Healing: ''
New_Description: These mutated badgers all have evil dispositions. They are inclined
  toward chaotic violence, bursts of inexplicable rage, and given to raiding their
  neighbors and gleefully engaging in wanton destruction. They walk erect and have
  human-like hands with opposable thumbs allowing them to wield any weapon they get
  their hands on. Their favorite weapons are vicious-looking bludgeons with spikes,
  the more spikes, the better. They wear chain mail and ring mail armor, preferring
  to cover it with the skin of their last kill. They also use flintlock pistols and
  bows with viciously barbed arrows.
Combat: Badders prefer to swarm their opponents. By overpowering their enemies with
  the sheer frenzy of their attacks, they hope to confuse them.   Their battle fury
  is so impressive that their opponents make all morale checks at -2 to their base
  morale score. Player characters do not have to make morale checks. Most of these
  creatures carry Tech Level III weapons, but some (usually nobility) possess Tech
  Level IV weapons as well. A few have Tech Level V artifacts. Fortunately, Badders
  do not known how to use these artifacts unless shown by their captives.
Society: Badders have a feudal society, with barons, counts, and the like as their
  leaders. The nobility makes the rules and is usually obeyed without question. Any
  Badders questioning rules or orders are killed immediately, and placed on display
  as an example for the rest of the society. Badder villages and steadings consist
  of underground, earthen tunnel complexes containing up to 100 males of fighting
  age, an equal number of females who will fight without weapons, and young. They
  are able to trade with other humanoids or intelligent creatures, since their reputation
  as thieves and brigands precedes them. This causes them to steal and kill for equipment
  even more.
