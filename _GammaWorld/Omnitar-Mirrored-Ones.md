Description: The omnitar are atmovores, that is, they exist without consuming any
  plants or animals, just microbes found in the air. They resemble 1.5m tall crystalline
  cones that have millions of 10cm bristles underneath that provide locomotion. So
  smooth is the bristling action that it looks like the omnitar is floating on air
  and just brushing the ground.

Behavior: Omnitar have no attack forms in and of themselves. They are immune to nearly
  every attack form but fusion rifles or trek bombs. Any weapon causing physical damage
  merely bounces off them. If hit by any other type of energy weapon, they add one
  point to their Hit Point score for every two points of damage" striking them. If
  struck with lasers or sonics, they will automatically return that round, treat as
  -1 to hit. If more that 750 points of damage are pumped into them, they will shatter
  causing fragmentation damage (5d10) to everything within a 10m radius.        Omnitars
  are usually found on plains, gentle rolling hills, and forests.
