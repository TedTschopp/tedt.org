Mission: ''
Description: Herps are mutant beetles that grow up to 3.5 meters in length, about
  the size of a subcompact car, with a thick, hard carapace and powerful mandibles
  able to crush metal and bone just as easily. They have six spindly legs and they're
  surprisingly accomplished climbers for their size.

Behavior: Their Carapace protects them from sonic attacks and they can squirt a stream
  of acid (I15) up to 30 meters which will dissolve 1 cm duralloy a minute.  They
  are skilled hunters able to track prey in any weather.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Herps tend to be solitary hunters. They attack first by spitting a stream
  of acid at their prey, then moving in for the kill. They're relentless, and can
  track wounded prey for hours over virtually any kind of terrain. They tend to avoid
  creatures larger than themselves, but otherwise they'll attack and eat almost anything.
Society: Herps fight even each other to protect their hunting grounds. They only cooperate
  in order to mate, with the female herp laying several large, rubbery eggs that hatch
  out into smaller herps, which scuttle off on their own.
