Mission: ''
Description: The barl nep is a mutant form of catfish that can attain a length of
  up to a meter and a half. Their scales are completely black and their heads are
  blunt and equipped with "whiskers" they use to help gather food.

Behavior: Once per day the fish can excrete an Intensity 18 radioactive oil that covers
  9 meters.  The slick will last 10 minutes.  If the fish is killed before it uses
  the oil, the oil may be extracted and carried in a lead-lined container as a Intensity
  12 Radioactive oil.

New_Description: ''
Combat: Barl nep react to potential threats by secreting a radioactive oil from a
  special gland in their body. The oil slick covers an area 10 meters in diameter
  and lasts for up to 10 minutes in a body of calm water (to as little as a few rounds
  in a river or stream). The oil effects creatures like the mutation Radiating Eyes.
Society: Barl nep are found in freshwater rivers, ponds, and lakes, prefering relatively
  calm, shallow water where it can bottom-feed on small plants and animals. They tend
  to be solitary, although they're sometimes found in pairs. If a barl nep is caught
  and killed before releasing its radioactive oil, it can be extracted from its body
  with a successful skill check. Barl nep are considered a delicacy in some parts
  of Gamma Terra, provided they're properly prepared.
