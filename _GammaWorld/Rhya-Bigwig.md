Behavior: A rhya hunts in a large depresion of its own making. It does this in an
  area that has clumps of grass instead of fields. It waits until a prey creature
  moves in front of its head. It snaps up and strikes forward, attempting to crush
  the prey with its mandibles. The poison is produced in a gland right behind the
  eyes and is excreted on to the mandibles. A rhya tries not to move much and thus
  will rarely hunt down escaped prey. If a predator shows up, a rhya will withdraw
  its breathing tubes and rely on its gills.
