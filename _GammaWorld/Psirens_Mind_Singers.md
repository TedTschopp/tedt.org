Description: These foul sea creatures look very much like female Mer-kind. However
  their disposition is quite evil. They are well aware of their physical similarity
  to Mer-kind (except for a row of razor sharp shark-like teeth) and will use it to
  every advantage. However, Psirens prefer to remain out of sight of their potential
  prey, if at all possible. They typically use their mutations to lure victims to
  their doom by first using Empathy to gage the emotional state of their target. Once
  this is accomplished, they will then begin singing" to their potential prey. Using
  Sound imitation to spread confusion (in any number of ways based on what their Empathy
  has revealed), or directly into the mind with Beguiling or Mental paralysis. The
  later is the preferred method to finish off their victims, as it keeps the Psirens
  out of harms way (and leaves their meal undamaged).
