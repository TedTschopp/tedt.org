New_Description: ''
Combat: It stores the ambient energy in the atmosphere around it and can release the
  energy in a bright golden beam that has a range of 20 meters (doing 1d20 damage).  Since
  the energy is drawn from a unique soruce it si not considered an energy weapon and
  there is no known armor that prevents the damage except sergon armor.  Sergon both
  hate and are fascinated by huanoids, especially humans.  It often imprioons and
  tortures humanoid prisoners just to see how they will react.  A sergon will always
  attack a human first in a party, or a humanoid mutant if no humans are present.  The
  last members of a party it will deal with are mutanted plants, believing them to
  be somewhaere on the order of salad or garneish in its meal of adventureres.
