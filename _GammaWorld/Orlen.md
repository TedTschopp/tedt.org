New_Description: Orlens are tall two-headed humanoids with four arms. Peaceful by
  nature, they are exceptionally intelligent and collect artifacts of all sorts. A
  typical orlen will possess artifacts of Tech Levels IV or V. In addition to the
  older artifacts they may have, all orlens carry an assortment of Tech Level II and
  III weapons and tools. (The GM will need to remember to add to the XP Value for
  an orlen based on what artifacts it is carrying.)  Orlens prefer not to resolve
  problems by combat, but their size, strength, and armament ensure that they will
  not be caught unprepared when trouble comes looking for them. All orlens have a
  dual name, one for the left head and one for the right, such as Jan-Jane, Maura-Maureen,
  Tim-Tom, and KevinCalvin. When an orlen talks, the heads alternate speaking.
Combat: Any given orlen's combat abilities will vary widely with the nature of the
  extra mutations he may have and what kind of weaponry he is carrying. A typical
  orlen might carry two battle axes, a duralloy shield, a flintlock rifle, and an
  IR laser pistol, with a grenade or two thrown in for good measure. He would prefer
  to save the pistol for an emergency and use the flintlock from good cover, entering
  melee only when necessary.
Society: Many orlens are wanderers, but there is a significant segment of the species
  that likes to settle down. The only orlen settlement of any significant size is
  Jainus, a fairly large city. Nomadic orlens are peaceful and gentle. The urban orlens
  are more aggressive and love sporting events, particularly those with a lot of physical
  contact. There is a story that the Orlens descend from a stable race of humans from
  before the great disaster.  This story says that humans from that time speak of
  a great thinker named Aristophanes whose goal was to reunite humanity to its orignal
  form before their war with the Gods.
