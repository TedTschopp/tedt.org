New_Description: Sleeths are lizard-like humanoids, the intelligent descendants of
  alligators . They have an erect stance, tails, long snouts, and dexterous hands
  . They are dark green in color.
Combat: Sleeths are normally peaceful. They use their mutations and intelligence to
  avoid combat, sending plants to attack and using telepathy and intuition to discover
  the intent of their opponents. They prefer using non lethal high-tech weapons to
  defend themselves. If forced, they will fight using me lee weapons of Tech level
  I, II, or III , coordinating their efforts with telepathy.
Society: Sleeths live in peaceful, scholarly communities.  Each sleeth village is
  headed by a dean, who often presides over a governing body called a faculty. In
  times of trouble, the deans of neighboring villages gather together and form a college
  . They then elect a president from among their number to preside during their decision-making.  Once
  the trouble is dealt with or the major decision made, the college and presidency
  dissolve, and the deans return to their villages.  The faculty is composed of professors,
  the most respected members of sleeth society.  Beneath the professors are teachers
  and students.  Visitors are often referred to as transfers.  Sleeths tend to be
  friendly to transfers . They are subtly arrogant in the extreme , however, believing
  themselves to be men tally superior to all other races.  Sleeths build beautiful
  villages and towns. They make full use of their plant control ability. Though sleeth
  villages and towns are mostly Tech Level III, they almost always contain high-tech
  items. These items are put to easse living contiinos and for defense.
