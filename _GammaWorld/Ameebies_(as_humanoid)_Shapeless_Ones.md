Description: Ameebies may be descended from giant microbes produced in genetic-engineering
  laboratories during the Shadow Years, though little else is known of their origins.
  An ameebie has two forms. The first is that of an amoph- ous blob, roughly 2-3 m
  in diameter. The blob is omnivorous and attacks living prey by attempting to stretch
  out, envelope, and smother the victim. A successful to hit roll means the ameebie
  has extended a pseudopod and successfully covered the victims face. (Being rather
  intelligent, the ameebie knows where to aim.) The victim takes 2d6 damage per Action
  Turn there- after until either it or the ameebie is slain. Blunt weapons (clubs,
  maces, etc.) do no damage to the ameebie in this form, as it can reshape itself
  to absorb the blows impact.The ameebies second form is that of a humanoid being,
  devoid of facial features, hair, and so forth. This form is about 1.5 m tall, and
  takes 2 Action Turns without interruption to assume. In this form, the ameebie cannot
  digest prey, as it is using all of its energy to maintain the humanoid shape. It
  is not known if ameebies can assume other forms.Ameebies cannot be affected by cold.
  They automatically form a hard, rubbery surface when subjected to cold tempera-
  tures, and actually gain 1 armor class level for every 10 hit points of cold damagethey
  absorb (even from mutant cold-gener- ating powers). The lowest armor class they
  can attain is AC 3.Ameebies are quite intelligent and may join adventuring parties
  out of curiosity. They see by using thousands of minute eyespots over their bodies.
  Though severely myopic (missing all objects fur- ther than 10 m away), they cannot
  be surprised within their limited visual range. Ameebies are deaf, but have normal
  senses of touch. They eat any organic matter, being immune to poisons. Some ameebies
  have learned to communicate with other beings using very rudimentary sign language.
  They also regenerate any physical damage they take.Nothing is known about how ameebies
  reproduce, though it is guessed that they use budding or fission. Ameebies cannot
  be contacted by using telepathic powers of any sort. For some reason, they seem
  to avoid their own kind, and are only encountered singly.
