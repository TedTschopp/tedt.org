Description: Very little is known about this strange and twisted species of mutated
  beings, They are thought to be sexless and so do not reproduce themselves biologically,
  propagating their kind by the destruction of other life-forms instead. The corpse
  of any human or humonoid creature killed by a screamer slowly metamorphs itself
  into a screamer the nightfall following the day of its death. The only way to prevent
  this is to completely destroy the body before the change is effected. From mere
  wounds inflicted by screamers, however, one recovers in a normal manner.Screamers
  appear as emaciated and shrunken humanoids with yellowish-grey skin. They are usually
  clad in the rotting remains of what was once normal clothing. The heads of screamers
  are brutally hairless and their faces have disappeared, mutated and melted into
  a glistening, featureless mass of sickly- colored flesh. Only a formless, cavernous,
  toothless mouth is still discernible. From this mouth come the unnerving moans,
  shrieks, and howls that give the creature its name. Though unable to communicate
  verbally and seemingly not capable of rational thought as we understand it, screamers
  appear to have a highly developed, instinctive sense of balance and direction.Radiation
  causes screamers to emit a bluish-green glow, the brightness of which varies according
  to the level of screaming maintained by the creature.AII screamers are totally immune
  to laser, radiation. stun, poison, heat and cold-based attacks. They possess the
  abilities of directional sense and life leech, the Iatter with a ronge of 20 meters
  (mental strength 12). In addition, the touch of a screamer gives a sudden lase of
  intensity 13 radiation to its victim.
