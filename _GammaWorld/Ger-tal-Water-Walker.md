Description: Ger'tal are mutant water striders. They have a slender, dark body, and
  the ability to "walk" on water. This is accomplished by large water resistant hairs
  on each foot. To move It extends one claw into the water (otherwise it would just
  sit there unable to move). They are important carrion eaters.

Behavior: They lay flat on the water until possible prey or carrion is sighted. If
  the prey is live, the ger'tal moves within range of its stunning force and uses
  it. Anyone not stunned is bitten or irradiated to death.Ger'tal are found in clumps-
  that is in groups that have no interaction between members. They feed on anything
  living or dead on or near the water.
