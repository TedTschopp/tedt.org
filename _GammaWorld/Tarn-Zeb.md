Description: This carnivorous horror arose from the fusion of intense heat and extremely
  high radiation levels caused by an exploding meteor as it crashed upon the surface
  of the earth. Fortunately, only one Tarn Zeb exists at this time, but wind-scattered
  seeds make it quite likely that more will appear in the near future.A 20 meter tall
  giant Mutated tree, this "thing"is highly visible because of its bright purple hide-like
  trunk (Texture Change) which gives the Tarn Zeb its armor class of 6. The strange
  mutation of "Physical Reflection" that this mutated tree possesses causes it to
  reflect all radioactive energies out in random directions up to a distance of 10
  meters. Long twisted branches filled with dwarf- sized leaves cover the entire upper
  region of the tree. Randomly distributed patches of yellow fruit populate the mutant
  tree's leafy branched areas.Growing all along the purple tree trunk are a dozen
  "Squeeze Vines" of lengths varying from 5 to 25 meters.The mobility of the Tarn
  Zeb is due to its four strong feet-like root projections each 2 meters long. Found
  at the under the base of the mutant, between its four "feet," is a hollow mouthy
  opening where the squeeze vines insert dead human-sized or smaller creatures that
  are to be eaten and digested.Strong "Aromatic Powers," effective up to 10 kilometers,
  lure creatures of all kinds toward the Tarn Zeb in the hopes that these victims
  will come close enough to become ensnared in the Squeeze Vines. Three of the Squeeze
  Vines per round can each do 2- 12 (2d6) points of damage. Unless freed, a snared
  victim will suffer 2 dice of damage each round until it dies;at which time the dead
  creature is fed into the mutant tree's mouth opening. Another attack form the Tarn
  Zeb possesses is its exploding yellow fruit. The three shortest Squeeze Vines each
  take turns plucking these fruit off the branches and hurling them at opponents.Only
  one such "missile" can be tossed per melee round and is always thrown at a penalty
  of -2 "to hit." A distance of 30 meters can be reached by anyone single toss.Once
  picked,the fruit explodes in 10 seconds and causes 3-18 (3d6)points of damage to
  all creatures caught in its one meter radius area of effect.The Tarn Zeb is a vicious
  opponent, but it knows that it is a solitary being and will retreat if it feels
  overly threatened after engaging its opponent or opponents in battle.
