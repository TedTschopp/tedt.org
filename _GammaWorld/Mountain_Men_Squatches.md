Description: Vast tracts of North Americas wild forests were destroyed in the years
  prior to the Social Wars and only a few large wildlife preserves were in existence
  before the start of the Social Wars Unknown to mankind these areas also served as
  the homelands of the mountain men formerly known as sas quatches or now squatches
  Semi intelligent apelike creatures the mountain men knew they had to avoid humans
  or perish Though they were sometimes spotted by trappers or hunters little hard
  evidence of their existence was producedFollowing the Social Wars and the disruption
  of civilization the mountain men left their forests and began to spread through
  the North American west Bigger and stronger than before they have also become more
  aggressive especially against Pure Strain Humans Mountain men attack with their
  fists refusing to use any technological items or tools If one hits an opponent with
  both fists he can hug the victim for an additional 1d8 points of damage and he will
  also attempt to bite the victim and inject intensity 5 poison into the oppo nents
  bloodstream Only those who are the same size as or smaller than a moun tain man
  may be huggedMountain men are also able to throw stones at opponents hurling rocks
  up to 5 m diameter as far as 10 m The largest rocks cause 3d10 points damage weap
  ons class 9 Mountain men can catch similar missiles if they see them coming firstMountain
  men live in caves forming loose family groups of 2d6 adults with 1d4 children Females
  and males appear in equal numbers Animal skins are used to cover cave entrances
  and to make beds A fire is usually kept burning near the cave entrance to ward off
  animals and to cook foodFemales often pick berries and dig for roots to get food
  for the family group while males hunt whatever herbivorous creatures live nearby
  If a mountain man tribe feels it necessary they will raid a humanoid village for
  food  Pure Strain Human villages are attacked with the intent to destroy them completelyMountain
  men do not like machines robots or any mechanical devices Even before the war their
  ancestors were known to have destroyed construction vehicles and automobiles Wardents
  and mountain men frequently trade with each other and a strong friendship exists
  between the two racesMountain men appear to be large brown gorillalike beings who
  walk erect Their thick fur keeps out the cold and serves as their only body armor
