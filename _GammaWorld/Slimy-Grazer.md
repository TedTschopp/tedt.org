Description: Slimy grazers are giant sea slugs found in the Great Western Ocean.

Behavior: "It is considered to be good luck to encounter the Slimy Grazer because\
  \ of their feeding habits. Only the desperate hunt slimy grazers even though they\
  \ are almost helpless. They can retaliate with a bite, but that's it. Slimy grazers\
  \ are found only near their only food source: sea lilies. As there are hundreds\
  \ of thousands of patches of sea lilies in Putrid Sound, slimy grazers are a semi-common\
  \ sight. Slimy grazers congregate only because of food, otherwise they are solitary\
  \ except during the fall mating season. Even then, they do not search each other\
  \ out, but will mate if they come in contact with each other."
