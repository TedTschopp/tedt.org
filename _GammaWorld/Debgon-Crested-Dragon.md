  skin and the great armored crest atop its head.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: It may either bite and claw as an attack or breath flame up to 25 feet.
  It usually hords small, shiny objects.  All gons are intelligent and have some form
  of mental powers that allows them to manipulate objects like a human for the purpose
  of passing through doors, moving objects about, etc.  Despite their size they can
  squeeze into small areas and are usually found in underground tunnels, caves, or
  installiations.  All gons establish dens and hoard loot as a natual instinct, though
  they often hoard different types of treasure. Gons have excellent armor-like skin.
  This skin can only be removed from a dead gon through 4d6 hours of uninterupted
  work. A character with the occupation of Hunter will be able to fashion one of these
  skins into a single suit of armor for a normal sized character two suits for characters
  who are smaller. Each suit will take at least 2d3 weeks to create. The armor class
  of the suit will be 2 and the suit will be allow the wearer to take half damage
  from laser and heat attacks.
