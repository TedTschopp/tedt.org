Description: A Verbat is an intelligent creature of unique appearance and purpose.  A
  verbat is spherical, covered with glossy black mirror-like facets, and is usually
  found floating mid-air.  They move about by levitation, but they can not levitate
  others and do not tire in levitating themselves.  A verbat has a keen memory and
  lives for centuries.  Despite its weird appearance, a verbat is both highly intelligent
  and peaceful and will not attack intelligent creatures unless provoked.

Combat: The Verbat's facets act as all the Physical Reflection mutational powers,
  with the excpetion that the verbat can direct the reflected energy attacks back
  at any target within range (-1 to hit, -10 damage, and -10 ranage from origanal
  attack).
Society: A verbat usually stakes out an area and keeps it clear of roaming monster
  or annoyances (rats, snakes, etc...) It usually stakes out passages or trails that
  are frequently used by many races and expects to be paid for its efforts.  To a
  Verbat, keeping an area safe is its job.  An adventurer usually encounters a Verbat
  rounding a corner or passing through a doorway into the Verbat's area.  Upon seeing
  the adventurer, the verbat will immediately announce a telepatic requiest, "Toll,
  Please!"  Toll-taking is standard with Verbat and can take the form of payments
  of loot, work in exchange for passage (like hauling the carcass of a dead opponent
  out of the area), or fighting for the Verbat (in the case of extremely tough advesaros
  it cannot fight alone).  Paymenst always must be made both upon entering or leaving
  a Verbat's area.  The exact toll is determined by the GM and depends on how much
  trouble it is for the Verbat to keep the area clear and how wealty the party appears
  to be.  Once a party becomes friendly with a Verbat (passing though his area and
  paying toll more than 4 times), imformation may be gained, by payment or otherwise,
  from the Verbat.  This information always concerns the area the Verbat patrolls.
