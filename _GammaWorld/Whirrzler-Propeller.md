Description: Whirrzlers are carnivorous desert plants that have developed a unique
  method of flight. They have no gas bags, instead rotating their flat rosettes of
  leaves so rapidly that they lift off like helicopters. They use this ability to
  settle their roots on carrion. Whirrzlers must feed fairly often; from time to time,
  they attack larger creatures wandering the desert. Whirrzlers are light metallic
  blue in color, so they are hardly visible at a dis- tance. However, they never surprise
  crea- tures that can hear, because of the low whirring sound they make when they
  fly. Whirrzler leaves are as hard as iron and as sharp as swords; they attack by
  edging sideways into their opponents and slicing with several leaves at once. Whirrzlers
  attack creatures with AC 1 or 2 only once before flying away, since this hurts their
  leaves (doing l-4 hp damage to them).Whirrzlers have the adaptation muta- tion,
  so each can only be injured once by any nonphysical form of attack. The GM may decide
  to which attacks any given whirrzler has become immune, or may roll 1d6  2 to see
  how many immunities it has developed. The GM should then roll 1d8 for each immunity
  on the following table. Whirrzlers encountered in radioac- tive deathlands are assumed
  to be immune to radiation.1d81 - Immunity2 - Cold3 - Heat4 - Light and lasers Electricity5
