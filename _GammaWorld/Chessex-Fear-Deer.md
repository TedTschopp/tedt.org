Description: The chessex are small, mutated deer that are pale yellow in color. They
  avoid most encounters by running away or by using their fear generation powers on
  carnivores, who have learned to leave the chessex alone. If cornered or surprised,
  chessex can attack with their antlers, which are hollow and filled with poisonous
  fluid that can be injected into antler wounds. This poison causes affected victims
  to lose 1 strength point per Action Turn until a strength of 3 is reached, at which
  time the victim must sit and rest for as many hours as strength points were lost.
  At the end of that time, the victims strength returns to normal.Chessex are herbivorous
  and can be found in large herds in the American Midwest. Human and humanoid barbarian
  tribes find the chessex highly important,as the poison from their antlers can be
  drained, allowed to thicken for 1d4 days, and made into Intensity Level 8 poison
  for use on weapons. This poison causes a strength loss of only 1d4 points. The tough,
  leathery hides of the chessex are used as armor (equal in all respects to leather
  armor), and the meat of these mutant deer has proved to be quite tasty. Tribesmen
  use missile weapons and traps to bring down chessex. Because of their mutations,
  these creatures cannot be domesticated. Chessex have learned to travel radioactive
  lands in order to escape hunters.
