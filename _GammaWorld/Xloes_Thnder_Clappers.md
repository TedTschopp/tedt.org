Description: This mutated snake grows to a maximum length of 4 m, and is a deep, cobalt
  blue in color. A xloe pos- sesses a single pair of lizardlike legs just behind its
  head which aid in movement, and its body splits into two separate tails, which gives
  the xloe the ability to use them as whips in combat.In addition, when excited or
  surprised, the xloe can slap its two tails together to produce a thunderous sound
  equal in force to a sonic blast, aimed in all direc- tions. This attack has a range
  of only 8 m radius, and can only be performed three times per day. Those who have
  never experienced this attack must roll against  their MS x 5 or flee as if affected
  by the fear generation mutation, as the blast temporarily affects the victims nervous
  systems. Those who have suffered one xloe blast, however, can mentally strengthen
  themselves against furtherattacks of this sort, and they do not have to flee.Xloes
  live in any climate save arctic and high mountainous regions. They prefer fresh-water
  lakes, probably because of the abundance of wildlife in these areas.
