Description: ''
Equipment: Skyzorr'n usually use Tech Level II devices and weapons, except for the
  sacred warriors which often have Tech Level III weapons.
Reactions: ''
Behavior: the cephalothorax has two long growths on it that fire darts. When the darts
  are fired, spinnerets on the edge of the 'harpoon' guns attach webbing to them enabling
  the lurker to reel in prey. Each harpoon gun can fire 8 darts a day.The poison of
  the darts is of a paralytic origin with a 'D' resulting in paralyzation for 1d8+12
  rounds, while that of the fangs is a neurotoxin with a 'D' resulting in death.A
  lurker will usually cover the ground of a large area and cover the web with debris.
  When a victim gets entang-led in the web, the lurker will start firing its darts
  at the prey. If the victim falls to paralyzation, the lurker will emerge from his
  ambush spot and web up the victim and drag him off to be consumed at a later date.
  If the victim is still standing after all darts are fired, the lurker will emerge
  and attack with fangs and hooks. If the lurker is losing badly in a battle, it will
  attempt to run off.If more than one lurker is encountered, it will be either a mating
  pair or a female and her young. These young lurkers have only half the hit dice
  of their parents and their poison intensity level is 8-12.

New_Description: Skyzorr'n are mutated giant ants that walk erect, have large mandibles
  they use as tools or weapons, and have four arms (all controllable at once to some
  degree). Skyzorr'n can be found almost anywhere except cold climes;  they are constantly
  sending scouts and explorers out to bring back information on possible new areas
  to colonize. Skyzorr'n are most often encountered in forests, the tropics, grasslands,
  and underground, but can go anywhere their interest takes them.
Combat: All Skyzorr'n have Sarbis phobia, a dreaded fear of the Sarbis race (probably
  an ancient race memory of ant-eating aardvarks). When a Sarbis appears on the scene,
  Skyzorr'n will operate at a - 3 CS penalty (or at - 30, whichever is appropriate).
Society: No other race gets along well with the Skyzorr'n; they are fierce, warlike
  beings who believe it is their destiny to one day rule Gamma World. They belong
  to no cryptic alliances and owe allegiance only to their own race and destiny. This
  does not mean that they are isolationists; the Skyzorr'n frequently trade with merchants
  and other races for the treasure their queen desires. Skyzorr'n peons or warriors
  are often hired out as guards or workers in exchange for payment. This also gives
  the queen a way of gaining information and keeping track of the activities of other
  societies.
