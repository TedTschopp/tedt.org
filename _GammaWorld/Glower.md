Description: These mutant fungi always live near or in radiation zones,and if possible
  will grow next to sources of water.They appear to be glowing reddish slime growths
  whose light slowly pulsates; hence the name Glowers.Growing on rocks and stones
  is their preferred place of habitat. Being near a river, stream, pond, or lake helps
  them to ensnare unsuspecting creatures that come to drink. Glowers grow to a height
  of only 5 cm and live in densely clumped patches.The Glowers release their Sleep
  Gas when touched by any living creature trying to put their victim into a deep sleep.If
  the creature falls asleep and lands on top of the mutant fungi, their dissolving
  juices will then go to work to break down the creature's body into digestible enzymes.These
  glowing mutants are a deadly poison if swallowed by any creature (Int 16). However,
  when these mutated fungi are boiled down, they produce an antidote for Int 16 poisons.Each
  square meter of this growth will yield one dose of this anti-dote.
