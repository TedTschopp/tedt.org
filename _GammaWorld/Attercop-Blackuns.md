Description: Attercops, also known as Blackuns, are mutated garden spiders.  They
  have long bristles across their bodies, making them unpalatable prey to all but
  the largest creatures.  They have 12 eyes located all over their head, giving them
  360 degree sight.

Behavior: The attercop attacks with a bite, causing 1d4 damage.  As the teeth hit
  their mark, the creature uses its electrical generation to jolt the prey.  Once
  its victim stops moving the attercop trusses it in stick webbing, Creatures held
  in this manner must make a DC 10 Strength Check to escape.  Attercops keep their
  prey as long as four days before they settle down to feed.  Because of the creatures
  extraordinarily high Mental strength, the attercop is completely immune to all mental
  attacks except illusions.  These mental attacks always succeed.  The attercop is
  a solitary hunter, allowing no others of its kind within its web or territory except
  during fall breeding, Female Attercops deposit a half-meter diameter egg sac containing
  over 1000 young.  Blights, bloodbirds and carrins hunt these young Attercops, likking
  all but a few dozen before they are large enough to defend themselves.  The Attercop's
  dale resistant web sometimes stretches over an area of 60 meters in diameter.  Creatures
  captured in the web need to make a DC 5 strength check to escape.  Any loot found
  in an Attercop's web is merely indigestible waste to the spider.  The lil, commonly
  take refuge within or behind attercop webs, although some fall prey to the spider.
