Description: Hoppers are herd animals that are mutated from Jackrabbits.  Each Hopper
  stands 3 meters tall at the shoulder, large enough to carry 1 man-sized creature.  Hoppers
  look like giant hares, the size of small horses, usually with brown or tan fur (although
  their fur color changes to suit the environment when they use their Chameleon Flesh
  mutation).

Behavior: These creatures have a rough gate and first time riders will have an 80%
  chance of falling off their hoppers and suffering 1d6 damage.  An unencumbered Hopper
  can jump over 90 meters

New_Description: These abysmally stupid animals look like giant rabbits and stand
  3 meters at the shoulder. Hoppers have a large rack of antlers, though some have
  simple curved horns instead. A jackalope's natural coloring is usually brown with
  a white underbelly. Some pure white specimens have been seen, and green, blue, and
  pink individuals have been reported. Because of its chameleon power, a hopper can
  appear any color, and pastel-colored individuals are thought to be the results of
  the use of this ability.
Combat: Jackalopes are easily spooked unless they have been trained. A wild jackalope
  will attack anything which startles it, leaping at the offensive being (or object)
  and attempting to skewer it. A hopper will attack until it is hurt or otherwise
  frightened, such as by a loud noise or bright light. Once it has been frightened,
  a jackalope will hop away, often pausing after only one or two leaps, hunkering
  down and using its chameleon powN m11rntion to blend in with its surroundings. After
  blending in, the hopper tries to remain still until it believes that the source
  of the danger has left. Wild hoppers are placid creatures that prefer to flee from
  danger as rapidly as they can. Domesticated hoppers can be trained not to flee from
  things like combat, but may require Animal Handling skills checks to keep under
  control. Hoppers are capable of delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs when
  threatened, although they only do so when cornered (or specially trained). Riding
  hoppers requires a special saddle and harness, since their normal gait consists
  of short hippity-hops and their full out run consists of great leaps interspersed
  between smaller hops. Failing an Animal Handling (riding) skill check while on a
  hopper usually means being thrown from the saddle.
Society: Hoppers live in small family herds. A typical herd will consist of half adults
  and half young. If approached carefully, young jackalopes can be captured and trained.
  They will respond to only one master, and will still be easily spooked, though the
  presence of its master will raise a hopper's morale to 12. Jackalopes have very
  rough gaits, and a first-time rider is 80% likely to fall off and take 1d6 damage.
  A trained jackalope can carry one man-sized rider. A hopper with a rider can leap
  10 meters, while an unencumbered hopper can leap as far as 15 meters.Hoppers are
  found in small herds on the plains and grasslands of Gamma Terra. Many cultures
  have domesticated hoppers as riding animals and (sometimes) beasts of burden, although
  they're not capable of carrying very heavy loads. Hopper meat is also a staple of
  many cultures' diets, and their fur makes soft clothes and blankets.
