Description: This is a huge metallic green tiger beetle. It looks like a long thinner
  version of a ladybug. They hunt in the air in open areas and by foot in closed ones.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: They attack by running prey down. They are quite intelligent and will use
  the best tactics for hunting. It will teleport if the prey does not sense it as
  to gain surprise. It spays the prey with gas from its abdomen, ant then uses its
  rending mandibles. They, unlike most giant insects live more than 2-3 years, they
  can live to 45. Thus they do from loose linked communities, and will help each other.
  They are the major predators in the areas that they are found. They do, on occasion
  try to communicate with other intelligent beings, but it is unknown why, as they
  tend to eat those they speak to.
