Description: Each head will have seperate Mental Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma.Descended
  from the snapping turtle, this two-headed creature is certainly one of the strangest
  mounts that can be found. A nireg is basically friendly in nature, though its left
  head tends to be aggressive in attitude and its right head prefers to solve things
  without a fight. Since the right head does all of the talking with other creatures,
  the left- sided head can be rather surly if ignored.Niregs are dangerous in combat.
  Aside from the bonuses that the left head gets in combat, a nireg can generate sonic
  blasts simultaneously from its two mouths. These blasts can be focused on a single
  target within range, and the two blasts combine to produce extra damage equal to
  a third sonic blasts effects. The two fore feet are clawed and can be used in fights
  as well. If an opponent is bitten by one of the huge, parrotlike beaks (which always
  strike first), then claw attacks against the bitten person are made at +4 to hit
  on the die roll.A nireg (if willing) can carry up to 200 kg at full speed over any
  terrain but the rockiest, and can haul up to 400 kg at half speed over smooth ground
  or roads. Niregs typically have a single name despite having two separate personalities.
