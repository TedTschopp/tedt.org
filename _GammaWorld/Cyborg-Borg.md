Description: Cyborgs were once Ancient humans who, in order to survive, had many of
  their fleshy parts replaced with robot parts.  They still possess near-human minds
  and should be treated as NPCs.  But the years have taken their toll, and many cyborgs
  have become insane or robotic in nature.  Some cyborgs have even become cannibals,
  eating any flesh they can capture.  Cyborgs are built of metal, plastic, and protected
  flesh.  Cyborgs form can vary greatly, so only some common features are described.Cyborgs
  have enhanced their strength and reaction speed.  They are still living creatures
  and require half the normal food and drink, but always carry at least a week's worth
  of rations in the form of artificial foods.  Cyborgs have also enhanced their senses.Most
  cyborgs possess reinforced arms with manipulative digits.  They also tend to have
  1d6 1 meter long tentacles and 1d6/2 robot tool arms.  Cyborg weaponry is built
  into their form and they can make two attacks a turn as if possessing dual brains.  They
  may also treat their attack rank as an experience rank to gain additional attacks
  by dividing their rank.

Behavior: Cyborgs will be armed with two laser pistols mounted internally but focused
  by a fiber optic that leads to two swivel mounted lenses.  They carry 2d6 grenades
  of varying types, concentrating mostly on concussion, poison, and tear gas since
  they are immune to the gas.  They also have a welding torch, sonic screwdriver,
  vibrosaw, and protein analyzer.  Cyborgs may be armed with other weapons that they
  use with their human hands.  Cyborgs are rarely encountered and most often will
  be in command of other robots.
