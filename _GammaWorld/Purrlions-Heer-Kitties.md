Description: Purrlions are among the largest mutant felines in North America, reaching
  3.5 m high at the shoulder and 9 m long (excluding the 3 m tail). Possessing a beautiful
  tiger-striping over a golden- brown coat, purrlions are fairly easy to domesticate
  as guards, and some communities have even used them as steeds, though they are not
  the best. A purrlion comfortably carries up to 230 kg of mate- rial, including riders,
  at full speed, but it wont often carry any more than that. Purrlions have a loping
  gait that is very uncomfortable for riders, particularly if the purrlions are moving
  quickly.Purrlions are able to climb large trees and steep slopes using their claws.
  One may even do this with a rider on its back, though the rider had better be securely
  fastened to his seat. Purrlions move very softly despite their size, causing opponents
  to be surprised on a roll of 1-4.Like their ancestors, purrlions have an affinity
  for certain smelly herbs and flowers, particularly catnip. Certain forms of mutant
  catnip cause purrlions to behave in a dazed and irrational manner, though the purrlions
  usually cause no injury to anyone while under the effects of this substance.
