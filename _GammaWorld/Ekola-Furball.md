Mission: ''
Description: The Ekola are 6 inch long mammals that closely resemble kangaroo rats.  They
  have four limbs and a prehensile tail, but most of their movement is primarily done
  by hopping on their hind legs.  When hopping the tail is wound around the body trunk
  to protect it.  Naturalists believe that an ekotla's tail is as sensitive as a human
  fingertip and can easily sort and pick up even minute items.  Their body is covered
  with soft, long fur that is either all white, black or black and white stripes.

Behavior: They make for great pets and can be trained numerous tricks and commands.  They
  can learn 1d16 separate command phrases.  They are hunted in the wilderness for
  their warm fur to line gloves and shoes.
