Description: The juggernaut is a large rhinoceros with bright red eyes and armor-like
  skin of a metallic, blue-black color. The juggernaut is not a carnivore, but is
  still dangerous as it may charge if irritated by some move- ment within 100 m of
  its eyes (its effec- tive visual range). A juggernaut will attack first by charging,
  and then by standing and goring one or two oppo- nents. A charging juggernaut can
  cover an amazing distance in one action turn (60 m), and a standing juggernaut can
  gore twice in a round. However, its weak eyesight makes it -4 to hit at all times,
  although it has good senses of hearing and smell. An attacking jugger- naut will
  use its radiation eyes (intensity3d4) while goring if it is really angry (GMs option,
  based on the situation). One charge will often satisfy a jugger- naut, especially
  if its target falls down and plays dead. However, a wounded juggernaut will attack
  anything in range at random (including trees). Juggernauts are totally immune to
  poison and radia- tion.Though juggernauts are found only in North America, they
  were not originally native to this land. They are descended from zoo specimens that
  escaped confinement during the Social Wars.
