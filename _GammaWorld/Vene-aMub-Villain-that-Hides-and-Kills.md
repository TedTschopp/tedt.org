Description: The Vene'a'mub is similar to a six legged scorpion with large, four gitit
  hands instead of pincers.  A bludgeon tail instead of a stinger, and a lizard like
  head that weaves back and forth on a thick muscular neck.  They are usually colored
  an oily blue when they are not camouglaged.  They have the intelligence and ability
  to cover themselves with their surroundings for their own safety or to trap prey.

Behavior: The Vene'a'mub only attacks when hungry or if walked on, a common occurrence
  considering its camouflage abilities.  It is also able to alter its exoskeleton
  to be wide or thinner, thereby flattening itself.  Their favorite food is bone marrow,
  which it feeds on after splintering the bone of its prey with its bare hands.  Because
  of this, they prefer mammals, and love slightly mutated ones.  They will always
  attack the mutants first..  They are very curious and can be found in most climates.  Their
  normal attack mode, upon grasping their prey, is to do crushing damage with their
  hands while swinging their mace-like tail over their body and down on the meal".
  Given enough time, a vene'a'mub can crack open almost anything, except a ba'mutan.
  They are curious, very tenacious, and are found in most climates.
