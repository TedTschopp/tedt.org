Description: This creature looks somewhat like the Blasshes and is a distant cousin
  of the Gamma Moth.  It can have a variety of patterns and colors, all designed to
  blend in with the surrounding area with their Chameleon powers.  Fire and heat will
  draw a Blassut at night.  They never go out during the day, using their infravision
  at night.  Their Wing Smash attack will affect everyone within 6 meters around the
  fire as the Blassurt tries to put it out.  The greatest threat that Blassurt's present
  is that they will attract a Tsorsut who eat Blassuts.  Every two turns that a Blassut
  is in the area there is a 35% chance a Tsorsut will attack.
