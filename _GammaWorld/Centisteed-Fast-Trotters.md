New_Description: Centisteeds are mutated horses of insectoid appearance, each having
  between 12 and 18 legs ( 1d4 +5 x 2). Centisteeds are usually colored in blotches,
  much like a "painted" horse. Their heads are horse-shaped, but they have two compound
  insect eyes, giving them 360' vision. Small mandibles fill their mouth instead of
  teeth.
Combat: Cemisteeds do not initiate combat at any time. They panic with the tiniest
  of provocation, perceiving everything as a threat to their meager lives. Unfortunately,
  the centisteed tends to trample any character or creature in its way. A successful
  attack means that the opponent has been knocked down and trampled with ld8 hooves.
  Each hoof does ld6 points of damage.   When the centisteed perceives danger, it
  immediately activates its force field generation to ward off any possible damage.
  If a rider is currently on the beast, the force field actually raises the character
  off the beast's back, causing him to fall to the ground. Centisteeds have been known
  to trample each other in their panic to follow another centisteed on the run. Once
  they get going, they are almost impossible to catch.
Society: Serf, are either encountered as a small patrol, or may be found in large
  'brigades' of 5d20+50 individuals.  (a bridage will include 30% females and 30%
  children.) Serfs are militant, and prefer to dress in uniforms imitating ancient
  military and police designs, using these as clan symbols.  They are lifely to attack
  other brigades of serfs as they are other enemies.  Although they are a Tech Level
  II society, they readily use higher Tech Level equipment if shown how to operate
  it.  They are semi-nomadic, traveling when food in a partiiclar area becomes scarce,
  or whth the changing of seasons.  Once every few years, at the whim of the commander,
  a brigade travels to Gran Rads.  Once there it partipates in a festival of celebration
  with other serf bridages, holding fladitorial contests and swapping stories.  One
  serf clan, the Ministers of Thought, never leaves Gra Rad.  Its memvers believe
  that a serf leader called the Forstar will be born to their caln there, and will
  lead the serfs to create a great new Nation.
