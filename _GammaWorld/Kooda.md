Mission: ''
Description: This mutated descendant of the great barracuda retains many of the habits
  of its ancestor. To become a successful feeder, the Great Barracuda developed a
  technique of racing through a school of fish with its blade like teeth attacking
  the helpless fish. After it injures and immobilizes some of the fish, the barracuda
  returns to snatch them up. Koodas do the exact same thing, but are even more effective
  due to their larger size and their mutations. The Kooda's Speed Increase is improved
  in that it can be used three times per day. Koodas use their highly evolved instincts
  to take advantage of the disorder that occurs around dusk, when the nighttime fish
  switch places with the daytime fish. It is at this time, when their prey least expect
  it, that Koodas make their attack.
