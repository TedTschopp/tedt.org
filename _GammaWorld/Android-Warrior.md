New_Description: Androids are artificial Life forms that have been designed to appear
  human, and are often mistaken for such upon casual observation. Androids were considered
  primitive and antiquated by the super-science metrics of the Ancient Ones, as their
  primary utility had been largely superseded by the use of soft-light and hard-light
  holograms. Still, there were times and places where economics favored the use of
  the ever-sturdy android. Thus, many were still in use at the time of the Great Disaster.  They
  are especially prevalent in areas where holograms can not be deployed. All androids
  have a limited amount of memory storage space, so they can effectively be taught
  in only one field of endeavour. They have been made sensitive to certain sonics
  frequencies so that they are easily damaged by them. They are powered by energy
  from energy cells.  The usefulness of this of creation is obvious. They can be made
  to have great strength; can be made to be very small and thus fit in places an engineering
  robot cannot enter. They can be made radiation resistant so that they can operate
  in areas where even a man in a suit would be in danger for any length of time. The
  medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for
  the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can
  be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each
  android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it
  will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows
  it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for
  24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure
  of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks. Lack
  of energy after 24 hours will cause the android to hibernate until energy is restored.
Combat: Warrior Androids are focused on protection and defense as their mission.  They
  are quite proficient in these outcomes and will selflessly sacrificed themselves
  for the good of their mission or team.
Society: Androids do not have a society.  They serve whomever created them.
