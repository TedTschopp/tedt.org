Description: Kreel torrn are large, bipedal grasshopper-folk with manipula- tive forelimbs.
  Though they have lost the flight capability of their ancestors, they still retain
  their leaping ability. Kreel torrn may leap up to 30 m in any direction every other
  Action Turn, for as many leaps as they have CN points. Afterwards, they must rest
  10 minutes for each leap made before they can leap again. A kreel torrn in mid-leap
  is -3 to hit and be hit.Kreel torrn are semi-nomadic beings and employ Tech Level
  I weapons and equipment. They often supplement their wealth by ambushing unwary
  travelers. When lying in ambush, kreel torrn use chame- leon powers to conceal themselves
  until their quarry passes by. They then leap out of cover, attempting to surround
  their prey and overwhelm any opposition, attacking to kill only if resistance proves
  to be too great.A favorite tactic of the kreel torrn is to hide completely out of
  sightand use their empathy to follow the progress of their target(s). A similar
  ploy is for the kreel torrn to wait in complete darkness, using ultravision to find
  their marks. Kreel torrn are opportunists and flee if their position becomes untenable.
  They can sometimes be hired so long as the work is not too hard and the pay is good.
