Description: The lurker barely resembles its ancestors. The body is heavily plated
  and the first pair of legs end in long, barbed hooks. All of the legs are covered
  in green fur, matching the coloration of the body.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: the cephalothorax has two long growths on it that fire darts. When the darts
  are fired, spinnerets on the edge of the "harpoon" guns attach webbing to them enabling
  the lurker to reel in prey. Each harpoon gun can fire 8 darts a day.The poison of
  the darts is of a paralytic origin with a "D" resulting in paralyzation for 1d8+12
  rounds, while that of the fangs is a neurotoxin with a "D" resulting in death.A
  lurker will usually cover the ground of a large area and cover the web with debris.
  When a victim gets entang-led in the web, the lurker will start firing its darts
  at the prey. If the victim falls to paralyzation, the lurker will emerge from his
  ambush spot and web up the victim and drag him off to be consumed at a later date.
  If the victim is still standing after all darts are fired, the lurker will emerge
  and attack with fangs and hooks. If the lurker is losing badly in a battle, it will
  attempt to run off.If more than one lurker is encountered, it will be either a mating
  pair or a female and her young. These young lurkers have only half the hit dice
  of their parents and their poison intensity level is 8-12.
