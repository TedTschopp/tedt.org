Description: The Ooz Blen numbers and hitdice are based per square meter.  Patches
  can be larger than that.The ooz blen is a form of mutated algae. This type of plant
  grows in patches near areas of radioactivity, almost always connected to a source
  of warmth. Hot springs, fumaroles, and living flesh are their favorite locations.Ooz
  blen are iridescent black in their natural state, and live on rocks or the branches
  of trees and feed on tiny organisms such as bacteria. They possess a life detecting
  sensitivity (New Sense), adaptability, color response to radiation, and tiny fiber
  extensions that allow them to enter into a symbiotic relationship with warm-blooded
  creatures (New Body Parts). A final ability, Teleportation, allows them to project
  themselves onto passing creatures.To establish symbiosis, the ooz blen will teleport
  themselves onto the surface skin of any warm-blooded creature that passes within
  range. Once on the skin, the algae must be scraped off for 1d10 Action Turns with
  the creature taking 1d6 damage with the creature taking 1d6 damage per turn of scraping.
  If the creature does not scrape off the algae for the number of turns rolled, the
  ooz blen uses their New Body Parts to enter the skin of the creature. This causes
  the creature to become a shiny black, as if they possessed an insect chitin over
  their bodies. The color is not dangerous, nor does the presence of the ooz blen
  harm the creature. The ooz blen will remain on the creature  it cannot be removed  for
  2d10 months, after which it will teleport onto some other character at the first
  opportunity.While on the skin (or fur, scales, feathers, etc.) the black color will
  remain useless unless the creature comes into the presence of radiation. If in an
  area of radiation, the ooz blen will change color (depending on the intensity  see
  chart below). The ooz blen will absorb one-half the damage from radiation.INTENSITY
  NEW COLOR1-5 Blue 6-14 Red 15+ GreenThe color changes actually help a creature survive
  radiation by giving warning through the color change and absorbing damage from harmful
  radiation.
