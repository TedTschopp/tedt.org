Mission: ''
Description: The boomerth looks like any one of many fruit bearing plants in Gamma
  World, with the exception that is can pick and throw its own explosive cherries.  The
  boomerth can even manage some limited mobility by shuffling its roots.  It mainly
  uses its attack and movement to defend itself.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: The reason the Boomerth needs to defend itself is that it also grows berries
  that provides 1d10 healing to any creature who consumes on.  The Boomerth can grow
  4d20 berries a season.  If all berries are picked from the Boomerth than the plant
  goes dormant for 24 months and all it will produce is the cherry bombs. If the cherries
  are picked and pickled properly they will maintain their explosive capabilities.  This
  is done by low tech level societies and archaic alliances.
