Description: A scorpito is a mutated form of scorpion. The creatures are approximately
  5 centimeters long. They are equipped with a pair of pincers, a jointed tail tipped
  with a stinger, and a pair of membranous wings.
Equipment: ''
Reactions: ''
Behavior: The stinger injects intensity 5 debilitative poison on a successful attack.
  Scorpitoes have two eyes forward and three additional eyes on both sides of their
  bodies. The quality of their vision, however, is very poor. They can't see clearly,
  but they are attracted to motion due to their numerous eyes. Male scorpitoes are
  typically broader and have longer tails than the females. When resting or waiting
  for prey, they will typically hide in a concealed location in a group of rocks or
  on the limbs of leafy trees. When flying, a swarm of scorpitoes makes a loud thrumming
  sound that can be heard from several hundred meters away. The sound is quite recognizable
  and most creatures known to stay away from it. While a single scorpito is not a
  particularly dangerous adversary, a swarm can be deadly. The creatures usually attack
  only in self- defense or for food. They have a voracious appetite in order to provide
  energy for flight, however, so hearing a swarm approaching is a sure sign that they
  are hunting.A swarm of scorpitoes will usually attack all at once. It is rare for
  them to retreat once an attack has begun. This is usually an all-out offensive with
  the goal of killing the prey. The intent is to land on the prey so that its pincer
  and tail attacks can be used. When flying, a scorpito can only use its pincer attacks.
  A successful pincer attack will allow the creature to land and use its stinger attack
  on the next round. The scorpito may use its pincer to hold on to the victim after
  it has landed. In this case, it can only attack with one pincer and its stinger.
  A successful attack on the scorpito is needed to dislodge it.In-fighting within
  a swarm is typical, though the intent is usually to subdue rather than kill. Males
  generally lead attacks when hunting, though an attack swarm may also include females
  without young. The swarms typically do not stay in one area for very long. They
  can essentially be considered nomadic. Potential prey usually becomes scarce after
  the animals in an area learn to associate the thrumming noise of the swarm with
  danger.
