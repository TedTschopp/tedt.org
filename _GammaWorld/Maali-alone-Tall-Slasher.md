Description: The maali are bipedal descendents of the ancient North American moose.
  They stand upright on two huge, wide claws chat ace as snow shoes. Their anders
  are unusually wide and extremely sharp. The maali keep them this way because they
  use them as melee weapons. Their front hooves have evolved into leathery, four digit
  , manipulative hands.

Behavior: Maali live in the forested areas of the Frozen Lands, but have been known
  to venture forth over the snowy wastes. They are rarely seen out of their natural
  habitats, except for mercantile ventures into the Highlands to the north for provisions.
  They are omnivorous, but prefer small mammals, bark, and leaves. Their teeth have
  developed into formidable crushing machines, and they can eat frozen plants as well
  as fresh ones. There are only a few Maali villages left in the Frozen Lands, but
  there are hundreds of smaller, nomadic tribes in the foothills of the Highlands.
  The Maali have an intense hatred for Harlan Quade's robots. Before Quade's reign
  of metallic terror began, the Maali were the lords and masters of these plains and
  wooded lands. They were well liked and respected by the ocher animals and peoples
  here. But over the centuries they have seen the various peoples killed and the land
  raped . The Maali have had co resort to severe weather control to strand Harlan's
  mad attempts at world conquering . They are all that prevents him from moving his
  Epsilon Cyborgs into the unsuspecting world. However, the Maali's size and fear
  of underground areas have prevented them from going in  and rooting Quade out of
  his stronghold. Maali are fascinated by non-robotic high technology and will always
  cry co acquire devices created by the Ancients. They are very skilled in the handling
  of such items. Most Maali have knowledge of up to Tech Level III, and some can even
  be found that known Tech Level IV items. They are wary of outsiders , especially
  human s, but are seeking aid in their fight against Quade. They have been promised
  aid by Scar, the mutant animal king of the mountains to the north. But Quade's forces
  have temporarily halted that aid by trying to assassinate the king (  all of this
  latter plot is the core of the Revised GAMMA WORLD game module, GWll) . The Maali
  usually are armed with at lease one Tech Level III weapon, a huge two-handed sword
  (12/24, otherwise created as a normal two-handed sword), and three javelins. They
  have escaped destruction by Quade's constructs because of their various mutations,
  their raw physical power, and their knowledge of the land.
