Description: (Mount) Daycuts are four-meter tall bipedal birds who have no flight
  wings, but are covered with large feathers.  Once properly trained, a Daycut will
  tolerate a saddle, but prefers a rider who rides bareback.  Daycuts can be found
  in most geographical locations and come in a wide variety of plumage and colors
  to match their native surroundings.

Reactions: ''
Behavior: An opponent who wishes to attack a weaving Daycut does so at -2 dice if
  the Daycut is not carrying a rider and -1 dice if they are carrying a rider.   Once
  in battle, daycust are quite fierce and loyal.  May are the accounts foa Daycut
  who died while standing over its fallen rider, protecting him, instead of fleeting
  to safety.  Inline some other mounts they have no ability to pick a rider backup
  and return him to safety.
