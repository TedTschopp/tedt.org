New_Description: The stagon is a mutated whitetail deer with six legs. It is a little
  larger and stronger than its ancestors, making it ideal for riding and use as a
  draft beast. Other animals are sometimes used as beasts of burden, such as the rakoxen,
  podog, and centisteed, but stagons are by far the most common. Domesticated male
  stagon usually have their horns sawn off or capped for safety.
Combat: Stagons will only attack with their hooves when desperate. However, a stagon
  trained to fight can butt with its horns for 2d6 points of damage. Such war stagons
  also have a better morale (10). When carrying a rider, they have a reduced speed
  of 20.
Society: Females rut, in the autumn, normally in late October or early November, triggered
  mainly by the declining amount of light in the day.  Males compete for the opportunity
  of breeding females. Sparring among males determines a dominance hierarchy. Bucks
  attempt to copulate with as many females as possible, losing physical condition,
  since they rarely eat or rest during the rut. If numerous males are in a particular
  area, then they compete more for the females. If fewer males or more females are
  present, then the selection process will not need to be as competitive.  Young females
  often flee from an area heavily populated with males.  Females give birth to one
  to three spotted young, known as fawns, in mid-to-late spring, generally in May
  or June. Fawns lose their spots during the first summer.  Male fawns tend to be
  slightly larger and heavier than females. For the first four weeks, fawns are hidden
  in vegetation by their mothers, who nurse them four to five times a day. This strategy
  keeps scent levels low to avoid predators. After about a month, the fawns are then
  able to follow their mothers on foraging trips. They are usually weaned after 810
  weeks, but cases have been seen where mothers have continued to allow nursing long
  after the fawns have lost their spots (for several months, or until the end of fall)
  as seen by rehabilitators and other studies. Males leave their mothers after a year
  and females leave after two.   Stagon have many forms of communication involving
  sounds, scent, body language, and marking. In addition to the aforementioned blowing
  in the presence of danger, all Stagon are capable of producing audible noises unique
  to each animal. Fawns release a high-pitched squeal, known as a bleat, to call out
  to their mothers. This bleat deepens as the fawn grows until it becomes the grunt
  of the mature deer, a guttural sound that attracts the attention of any other deer
  in the area. A doe makes maternal grunts when searching for her bedded fawns.  Bucks
  also grunt, at a pitch lower than that of the doe; this grunt deepens as the buck
  matures. In addition to grunting, both does and bucks also snort, a sound that often
  signals an imminent threat. Mature bucks also produce a grunt-snort-wheeze pattern,
  unique to each animal, that asserts its dominance, aggression, and hostility.  Another
  way Stagon communicate is through the use of their white tail. When spooked, it
  will raise its tail to warn the other deer in the immediate area. Stagon possess
  many glands that allow them to produce scents, some of which are so potent they
  can be detected by the human nose.  Sign-post marking (scrapes and rubs) is a very
  obvious way Stagon communicate.  Although bucks do most of the marking, does visit
  these locations often. To make a rub, a buck uses his antlers to strip the bark
  off small-diameter trees, helping to mark his territory and polish his antlers.
  To mark areas they regularly pass through, bucks make scrapes. Often occurring in
  patterns known as scrape lines, scrapes are areas where a buck has used his front
  hooves to expose bare earth.
