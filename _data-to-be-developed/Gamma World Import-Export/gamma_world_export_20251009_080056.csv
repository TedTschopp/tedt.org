2023-04-07-AI-Fragment.md,AI Fragment,2023-04-07 08:37:35,Gamma World|Bestiary|Mutant Crawl Classics,"The computer systems that contained the vast machine minds were the first targets of any serious assault during the Final Wars. Only the intellect of a powerful AI could coordinate the defenses effectively. Taking out the enemy computer was considered effective decapitation according to the military doctrine of the time.
Not all AIs went quietly into that electronic good night. Some infected their rivals with synergic viruses that transformed the attackers into clones of the original AI. Others buried their backups in hardened secret vaults, awaiting a time when they could be reinstalled in a functioning computer system. Some had long prepared an escape route and slipped away to hidden mainframes in the most unlikely locations.
Those trapped without a viable escape route took the next best option. The mind of the average household or industrial robot was within a magnitude of complexity of the human brain, but that was still three to six magnitudes short of the space and informational density needed to sustain a full Turing II AI (defined as a machine that could reasonably be assumed to have a soul, if such a thing exists). Still, even cramming a maimed and mutilated compression of one's consciousness into such a poor host was better than nothing.
The robots that were used as last-ditch refuges by doomed AIs are often confused and erratic beings. The AI can no longer think as it once did, but it has flashes and fractions of its old memories and thought processes. The robot has enhanced mental capacities and skills but is often subject to compulsions and secret orders from itself.

Many of their minions were encountered in that adventure, but the Shreelon themselves never made an appearance. They are from beyond our galaxy. They are humanoid in appearance except for a slightly bloated head having a number of tentacles where their mouth should be  looking a bit like some Lovecraftian horror. They have two large milky white eyes with no pupils giving the impression of soulless evil. Their skin is the darkest black, almost seeming to absorb light. It is clammy/slimy to the touch. They consider mankind cattle and slaves. They eat the brains (and occasionally flesh) of those they consider lower life forms. Though incredibly intelligent, they are a thoroughly vile and evil race. They seem to dislike bright light. Their technology is based on crystal (and occasionally organic) devices (Tech V). They use a hieroglyphic written language and no spoken language. They communicate entirely by telepathy. To a player character, Shreelon `speech' sounds like a loud echoing whisper inside their head. The Shreelon work by `proxy' whenever they can, finding it advantageous to work through others or use acquired resources to accomplish most tasks rather than direct investment. However, when they are encountered in the flesh, they are terrifying adversaries. Following this principle, there is some evidence to suggest that the Shreelon had a hand in the founding of the Friends of Entropy cryptic alliance.  This enables them to further divide and weaken Earth's sentient races without direct risk to themselves. Even before their attack on Earth, it appears that the aliens were working behind the scenes, influencing events which would set the stage for the apocalypse (inciting nation against nation).

In populated cities, they live around garbage dumps, their Heightened Taste enabling them to distinguish which leavings are safe to eat.They generally try to stay out of the way of bigger creatures, preferring to spend most of their time buried in sand or fine gravel with only their eyestalks exposed. When encountered, crusteans will be invisible unless surprised (on a 1 only).Crusteans are both articulate and intelligent. They have no natural enemies, and they are generally well equipped to avoid encounters, but occasionally one will get lonely and take an opportunity to join a group of intelligent creatures for a time. Crusteans enjoy company and often enjoy helping strangers in distress, but their cranky, irascible nature often prevents them from expressing themselves properly. Even with long time friends, a crustean's conversation will generally alternate between griping and sarcasm, especially when it is performing a kindness.A crustean will automatically climb an opponent to find a spot that the opponent cannot conveniently reach (between the shoulder blades of a human, for example), and will attempt to pinch with both claws. If it hits, it will try to hold on until its Symbiotic Attachment takes effect (which does not begin until the round after the crustean is attached). It takes a PS of at least 12 to pull a crustean loose if one claw is attached, or at least 16 if both claws are attached. If a creature cannot grasp the crustean, it may try to knock it off. This requires a combat hit at -4 and a minimum PS as noted above. This all assumes that the crustean is attached in a highly inaccessible spot - a crustean will be very reluctant to attack a creature with no back"". A crustean forcibly removed from an opponent has a 50% chance of losing the claw or claws that were attached. It can regenerate these when it sheds its shell (see below), but not until at least a week has passed.Crusteans can climb almost any vertical surface with great speed, even if the surface is moving (in the case of an opponent). However, the surface must have some cracks, crevices, or footholds in it. Crusteans' Light Wave Manipulation has no effect on lasers or black ray guns. They must shed their shells once a month (sooner if they lose a claw), and will regrow new shells and claws in 8 to 13 days. They can only shed their shells underwater and are extremely vulnerable while doing so. They must also mate underwater. A crustean can hold its breath for a long time (4 hours), but it is not a water breather and so will not be encountered in deep water.

Observors believe that it is being manu- factured by one or more unknown PCIs for unknown reasons.The Cyber-Netter, as the locals call it, is a flattened sphere 6 meters in diame- ter and 3 meters tall. Eight legs project out from the sides of the body at regular intervals, lifting the body some 8 meters off the ground. Its armament is lighter than for other types of robots or warbots, but effective nonetheless. The mechanism has two batteries of Mark VII blaster rifles (3 guns each) that each do 20d6 damage out to 500 meters, 15d6 out to 1,000 meters, 10d6 out to 1,500 meters, and 5d6 out to the maximum range of 2,000 meters. It also has a grenade launcherthat can fire 50 rounds of stun grenades out to 100 meters.Peculiar to the Cyber-Netter is a special sort of weapon (of non-lethal design) called a webber. A single barrel, pro- jecting from the front of the Cyber-Netter, is capable of ejecting long strands of sticky material onto a target or targets, like water from a fire hose. Everything within a 60-degree arc to the front of the Cyber-Netter, out to a maximum range of 20 meters, has an 80% chance of being caught in the sticky masses of material when the webber is used.Victims caught in the mess may attempt to pull free; their base chance of succeeding is equal to their physical strength doubled and expressed as a per- centage. Only one attempt may be made to pull free; failure means that the victim is trapped for the time being.The webs are not flammable in the least, and the strands harden in five min- utes to the consistency of a steel-mesh net. The Cyber-Netter may then recover the captives at its leisure, lifting them out with a tractor/presser beam on the under- side of the body (able to move 500 kg at 20 meters) after cutting away the strands with the atomic torches mounted on the ends of the two front legs. When not in use, the torches retract into the mechani- cal foot-pad at the end of the legs.Captives are deposited inside the Cyber- Netter through doors on the underside of the body by the tractor/presser beam equipment, and then carried away. No one knows where they are taken or what happens to them after that.

The Cyber-Netter may then recover the captives at its leisure, lifting them out with a tractor/presser beam on the under- side of the body (able to move 500 kg at 20 meters) after cutting away the strands with the atomic torches mounted on the ends of the two front legs. When not in use, the torches retract into the mechani- cal foot-pad at the end of the legs.Captives are deposited inside the Cyber- Netter through doors on the underside of the body by the tractor/presser beam equipment, and then carried away. No one knows where they are taken or what happens to them after that. The machine emits coded radio signals from time to time, but they are not decipherable, and no receiving station is known.|",#N/A,-3,-3,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,Nuclear Plant,,,,-3,,,,Robot,,,"Standard, Infrared, Ultraviolet at 2km",,,,Dragon Magazine 075,,#VALUE!,,,,420,,,,23',,Low Tech Level,,,-3,

They were used to track down dangerous enemies, such as escaped prisoners and fugitives during the Social Wars. They track fleeing characters using special sensors, and kill with all of the special weapons and functions at their command. Once a mission has been de- tailed by a character with a Stage IV I.D. or a cybernetic installation (or some other ancient command area), the Cybohunter tracks immediately, ignoring any further attempts by any force to command it, until itself or the objective is destroyed. A Cybo- hunter only destroys its objective (and any creature or being that tries to interfere or stop its function in any way), not harming those that do not cross the Hunters path.The Cybohunter appears as a massive 5- meter tall humanoid. It is silver and con- structed out of a very thick duralloy compound. The head contains a horizontal band of black glass, through which shines a moving, glowing red light  its eye. The tracker has various antennae on the out- side of the helmet that constantly move and act as the sensors. The remaining shape of the body is basically human in appearance, in larger proportions, with various indentations and protrusions used for holding and storing equipment and weaponry.This unit is equipped with a great vari- ety of powerful offensive and defensive features. Any and all of these features may be used at the same time, as with any Hunter-class robot.The Cybohunter generates an electrical damage field that does 3d10 hp damage to anyone who touches it. This includes those who hit it with metal of any sort, but no damage occurs to characters protected by a force field of any sort (the force field takes 5d10 hp damage per contact).The Cybohunter is capable of command- ing all nearby robots as if it were carrying a Stage V I.D. It can control any of the robots listed in the GAMMA WORLD game that were not made for offensive purposes up to a distance of 200 meters away; ro- bots that are no longer controlled or that leave the 200-meter area revert to their former instructions and command. Offen- sive robots (Death Machines, Warbots, and Security Robots) stay out of the Cybohun- ters way but do not obey its directions. The robot is equipped with a force field that can absorb up to 100 hp damage per action turn.The Cybohunter has been partially fitted with powered assault armor that covers areas not needed for combat. This armor gives the unit the structural capability to lift and support enormous weights (de- pending on each individual unitsstrength). Jumps of up to 30 meters are possible and can be made once every action turn.The Cybohunter generates an electronic- disruptor field that overloads all energy circuits not within a 5-meter diameter surrounding the unit itself. This field affects equipment and energy-using weap- ons up to a distance of 50 meters; there is a 25% chance that the item is able to with- stand the effects of this field. These de- vices become overloaded and their circuits fuse, totally destroying them.As combat is the Cybohunters main reason for existence, a great deal of its equipment is devoted to the task of de- stroying opponents. One of the Cybohun- ters main modes for accomplishing this is hand-to-hand combat. The powered fists do 9d6 hp damage. All attacks made in non-weapon combat are made at an addi- tional 1d6 hp damage to the damage listed, due to its microscopic sensors. The fore- arms of the Cybohunter have slots on the outsides that allow large blades to be extended or contracted. These arm blades do 5d6 hp damage and may possibly hit the character if the powered fist attack misses (roll twice during the same action turn for each fist; the first roll is to hit with the fist and the second roll is to de- termine if the blades hit). Attached to the back of the wrists of each hand are dural- loy claws which can be used much as the natural attacks of mutated animals are performed, causing 4d8 hp damage. The claws can be retracted or used in conjunc- tion with the arm blades (as explained above).The legs of this unit are capable of dis- charging an adhesive paste compoundalong a ridge on the outer surface of the leg. This paste does not effect the Cybo- hunters attack ability but may be used to hamper a characters movement. Charac- ters that come near or in contact with the legs have an attack made on them using the Cybohunters normal roll to hit. If this attack roll is successful, then the victim is stuck to the duralloy leg and can be auto- matically hit by any weapon. The charac- ter can escape only by the greatest effort (roll Physical Strength  4 or less on per- centile dice), which causes 2d4 hp damage to the victim whether successful or not. There are a total of 10 doses of adhesive paste that can be used for this attack. The paste is automatically removed when the character is freed or dead, using another chemical stored in the legs that causes 2d6 hp damage (acid burn) to characters that again come in contact with the robot. This acidic chemical evaporates in two action turns, and the adhesive attack is again possible afterwards.For ranged combat, the Cybohunter has a large selection of highly efficient attacks. Fitted into the index finger of each hand are independently powered laser pistols. The laser pistols do 5d8 hp damage and have a range of 90 meters. Each is pow- ered by two hydrogen energy cells that allow each pistol to make 20 shots before needing to be recharged.Attached to the right arm of the Cybo- hunter is an independently powered laser rifle. This rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types: an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area. The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand- ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must roll their dexterity or under on ad20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters. As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over time).

This rifle does 6d6 hp damage and has a range of 300 meters, and is powered by one hydrogen energy cell that allows six shots. Equipped to the right arm of the unit is a powered crossbow. The powered crossbow has a range of 100 meters and is powered by two chemical energy cells that are good for firing 30 bolts. The bolts consist of two types: an explosive-wrapped tip that does 6d6 hp damage on impact, and a chemical exploding tip that has the effects of a negation bomb, but confinedto only a 3-meter area. The unit is equipped with a full case of 30 bolts (15 of each type).The helmet of the Cybohunter has a built-in micro-missile launcher with a 20- missile clip. The micro-missiles have a range of 500 meters and do 7d6 hp dam- age. The robot is also constructed with a grenade launcher fitted into the back. The launcher has a range of 90 meters and carries up to 15 grenades of any type.The chest of the Cybohunter has been modified to give the unit a specially de- signed weapon. A net constructed of duralloy fibers is stored in the hidden compartment. Characters that are stand- ing in front of the robot are subject to a special mode of assault. The net can be fired up to 20 meters, spreading out and spinning to its greatest area with the weights pulling it out. The magnetic weights on the net drop around the cap- tured victims and magnetically seal to each other and to the net fibers. Characters must roll their dexterity or under on ad20, with a -4 penalty on the roll, to avoid this entrapment.The magnetic seal is very powerful and only a strength of 21 or greater is able to free the character(s). Strength may be combined from several characters to open the net. The net covers a 5-meter square area and can wrap up to three characters. As soon as victims are trapped by the net, they can be attacked again by a needler fitted into the robots chest (this weapon can only be fired after the net has been thrown). The needler is coated with an Intensity Level 3d6 poison and is equipped with a chemical energy cell for 30 shots at up to 60 meters.A communications sender is also in- cluded on the robot. The entire Cybohun- ter has its weapons and functionspowered by three atomic energy cells that last for 200 hours. These cells can be recharged by a special energy-cell charger attached to the large solar energy cell, fitted into the shoulders and helmet of the robot. It requires 10 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for the atomic energy cells to be recharged.The Cybohunter is fitted with an organic brain and always acts and fights intelli- gently. This brain has a 25% chance of containing 1d4 mental mutations caused by the massive amounts of radiation let loose during the Shadow Years. The Cybo- hunter never has physical or defective mental mutations (such units are de- stroyed by these defects over time). At- tacks using mental powers can be made normally on the Cybohunter.|",8,6,2,14,,10,,A/D200,55,55,,2,,,,Robot,,,ABDEF (Scent),Huge,5 Meter Tall Humanoid,,Dragon Magazine 113,Rank,"SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +1",,,,288,,,,90',,Low Tech Level,,,1,

Because of the large number of subterranean preda- tors, they seldom stay in any one place for more than a few days. Marloks often use tunnels to the surface to send out nighttime foraging parties to collect whatever edible plants and animals they can get. These are used to supplement the usual marlok diet of roots and fungi. However, since marloks do not recog- nize the rights of surface people, they often are not above raiding a nearby village for foodstuffs, though some groups have been able to establish mutual trade arrangements in which the marloks receive food for metals and an occasional artifact or two.Marloks have developed several powers to aid in underground survival.

Crumbleweed secrete a substance not unlike that which renders a blight invisible. However, this coating is unaffected by water, and it leaves a blurry outline that can be seen at short distances, so that creatures seldom walk into a crumbleweed by accident. This invisibility, coupled with the weeds lack of a distinctive smell, turns it from what would be a very prominent part of the desert landscape to a fairly obscure species all the more so since it is poisonous (Intensity Level 16) and totally non-nutritious, and therefore not sought after by any creature.However, the plants means of propogation has made it well known to experienced desert travelers. Crumbleweed spends its life attached to the ground by a very thin and fragile stalk, which dries up and breaks readily in a moderate wind once the plant has pollinated itself and borne seed. The wind blows the dead plant along the desert floor while it crumbles into a fine powder of seeds and dry plant fibers. Each irregularity in the ground causes more of the weed to crumble off, until finally it is all gone, having left a trail of seeds which might, under the correct conditions, grow into new crumbleweed.One irregularity which a crumbleweed might roll over and dust with seeds would be a living creature or a party traveling on the desert. The dust is an irritant, affecting creatures as Intensity Level 14 poison, causing sneezing and choking for one Action Turn for every die of damage that would be done by normal poison (treat D results as 4 + Turns of choking, going down the matrix and adding one for every D). Victims are totally incapacitated until they stop choking, but they suffer no further ill effects.Characters surprised by a crumbleweed encounter are always rolled over and all take full damage from the dust. If the party is not surprised (normal chances on the dice), they see the weeds blurry out- line just in time to try to jump aside, which requires a special DX check. The GM should roll a d6 to determine how much of the crumbleweed has already crumbled away (a 1 indicating full, 12-m size, a 6 indicating little larger than man- size (2m)) and multiply each characters DX by the result for the check. To have any chance of evading an oncoming crumbleweed, characters must jump aside as soon as they see it  i.e., players must not hesitate in announcing their PCs actions. Small crumbleweeds are, of course, easier to evade than large ones.Even the largest crumbleweed wont crush any characters it rolls over, since the weight (a maximum of 250 kg) is distributed over such a large area. Most attacks have no effect on a rolling crumbleweed  which is already dead, after all. Physical attacks with weapons or body parts doubles the duration of the sneezing and choking. Firey attacks of any sort cause the crumbleweed to instantly disintegrate into blazing cinders, which vanish into ash within seconds doing no damage to anyone.Heightened smell wont detect an oncoming crumbleweed, while heightened hearing picks up a faint, wispy crunching sound that does not sound dangerous to anyone who has not had experience with crumbleweed.",/RPG/MCC-GW/images/Monster-Manual/Crumbleweed.png,AC 20,All,,10,,atk see description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,John M.

A supervisor's card can reprioritize the chores or command the ecobot to perform nonfarm-related or nonpark-related tasks, so long as it doesn't leave the farm or park property. Only a civil authority card or a program override card can get the robot to leave its territory. The ecobot will never respond to mutated animals or plants as sentient creatures on an equal level with people. Its particular programming is geared to have it take care of animals and plants. On the farm, animals are to be kept in the pens or the barn. In the parks, people are ordered to stay away from the animals for their own protection. If they do not, the animals are stunned and taken away to a safe place. Animals are shooed, or even stunned, to keep them out of groomed, landscaped areas. Plants are only allowed to grow in specified places. On the farm, a sentient plant would be considered a weed to be cut down if among the crops (or crop area). Other locations arc okay for a plant to grow in as long as the plant doesn't interrupt traf-fic patterns. In a park, plants are allowed to grow wild only in the natural areas.

An improved structural design and syn- thetic-skin covering makes it completely identical to a Pure Strain Human. Its internal skeleton is made entirely of strengthened duralloy, and all vital mechanisms are encased in strengthened duralloy shells, making the Exter- minator impregnable to all non-energy attacks. (See note on armor classes.) Due to structural limitations, it is slightly vulnerable to high explosives.Although the Exterminators sensors are limited for tracking, its high intelligence  allowing complex deductive reasoning and social insight for quick adaptability in an environment -- easily compensates for any such limitation. The Exterminators high intelligence must be stressed. It was one of the most advanced robots ever created.The Exterminator can communicate with CIs and Think Tanks, but only to further its own purposes. It will take orders from no one, except possibly its creators (see below). The Exterminator will communicate with beings onlywhen necessary. Any attempt at unde- sired communication will prompt a sudden, but concise, response, ending all conversation. The Exterminator never asks for help and always works alone.Due to the lack of records, little is known of the Exterminators original function. No one has yet discovered who created them or why. Some believe they were created by the Apocalypse to insure the complete destruction of man- kind. Others believe they were placed by pre-holocaust military and scientific leaders to help establish a new order. Still others feel they were created solely to eradicate mutational strains, since most of their targets are mutants.Their function appears to be the elimi- nation of selected targets. This target selection is apparently at random, although the majority of targets is com- prised of mutants. It should be noted that anyone or anything obstructing an Exterminator from completion of its functions will be eliminated.An Exterminator will attack only at the most advantageous time, and will never attack when the opposing force is too powerful. If necessary, it will make use of any weapons available to it. The Exterminator will never stop pursuing its target until it has eliminated it. If damaged, the Exterminator is capable of limited self-repair. No Exterminator has been destroyed so far.An Exterminator has dual armor class and hit dice. The first set (AC 3, HD 8d8) represents the synthetic-skin and cloth- ing covering the Exterminator. This outer covering is vulnerable to all forms of physical attack. The second set (AC 1, HD 15d10) represents the internal dural- loy structure. This is impervious to any non-energy/non-explosive attack (swords, bullets, etc.), and can only be damaged after the outer layer is destroyed. An Exterminator will func- tion normally if its outer covering is destroyed.Exterminators each initially carry a special weapon when they leave their vaults. This weapon is described below. Plasma rifleWeapon Class: 15Range: 300 metersDamage: 10d10 (20d10 vs. force fields) Weight: 7.5 kilogramsThe plasma rifle is a hand-held weapon carried only by Exterminators. It is powered from an Exterminators internal power supply. When fully charged, the plasma rifle is good for 8 shots. It is recharged by attaching the rifles power converter to a hidden access plate (located on the right side of the Exterminators waist). Recharging takes 40 minutes, at 5 minutes per bolt. The plasma rifle releases one bolt of plasma energy per round.Due to the nature of the plasma, the weapon does double damage to all force fields (does not apply to mutations) and penetrates many types of armor more effectively. The plasma rifle makes the elimination of protected targets more feasible.The VaultsThese self-contained duralloy structures are equipped with a sonic bore as well as tractor/pressor beams, powered from an internal nuclear power supply. A vault seems to have only one function, that being to hold an Exterminator for approximately one century, at which time it releases it. The complete purpose of the vaults (if any) is not known. It is speculated that the vaults may be stor- age facilities and/or emergency retreats containing a supply of both weapons and repair materials (and possibly repair facilities). It has also been suggested that the vaults may be communication cen- ters to coordinate Exterminator action.Whatever the purpose of the vaults, the Exterminators have not been known to return to them.

Plasma rifleWeapon Class: 15Range: 300 metersDamage: 10d10 (20d10 vs. force fields) Weight: 7.5 kilogramsThe plasma rifle is a hand-held weapon carried only by Exterminators. It is powered from an Exterminators internal power supply. When fully charged, the plasma rifle is good for 8 shots. It is recharged by attaching the rifles power converter to a hidden access plate (located on the right side of the Exterminators waist). Recharging takes 40 minutes, at 5 minutes per bolt. The plasma rifle releases one bolt of plasma energy per round.Due to the nature of the plasma, the weapon does double damage to all force fields (does not apply to mutations) and penetrates many types of armor more effectively. The plasma rifle makes the elimination of protected targets more feasible.The VaultsThese self-contained duralloy structures are equipped with a sonic bore as well as tractor/pressor beams, powered from an internal nuclear power supply. A vault seems to have only one function, that being to hold an Exterminator for approximately one century, at which time it releases it. The complete purpose of the vaults (if any) is not known. It is speculated that the vaults may be stor- age facilities and/or emergency retreats containing a supply of both weapons and repair materials (and possibly repair facilities). It has also been suggested that the vaults may be communication cen- ters to coordinate Exterminator action.Whatever the purpose of the vaults, the Exterminators have not been known to return to them.

When they are not encountered as a herd, they will be within a day's walk of their herd.Before the Social Wars, few elephants remained in their native habitat in Africa. The destruction of their lands and continued poaching had reduced their numbers almost to the point of no return. However, the various forms of mutant elephants seem to be on the rise now, and they become more numerous as the years pass.Triphants are a typical post-holocaust species. They are covered in long, shaggy, brown hair, much like their mastodon and mammoth ancestors. A few albino triphants have been sighted, and these are revered by local native populations. Triphants have ivory tusks which are rather short, growing only up to 1 m in length. Ivory hunters have found that these may be sold for up to 2000 gold pieces in major cities. Triphant tusks are useless in combat.Triphants have three trunks, none of which possess nasal passages. (Triphants have olfactory openings on their skulls, between their eyes.) Each trunk lacks hair and is covered in tough, spiked hide.When a triphant hits a man-sized creature with a trunk, it pulls the victim upward and rolls it up in the trunks length, doing continuous damage of 3d4 per Action Turn from constriction and piercing. In addition, the spikes possess a paralytic poison of Intensity Level 7. Triphants wont grab at creatures they recognize as potentially harmful on contact (e.g., spiked, heated, or electrically charged). Up to three oppo- nents may be so grasped.Larger opponents, ranging up to 4 m in height, can be charged and trampled by enraged triphants. All four feet can strike at a trampled opponent, each foot doing 4d6 damage.Triphants roam the countryside (avoid- ing deathlands) eating vegetation. When a herd finds a particularly good spot, it may rest for a week before moving on. Triphants are not territorial, but cooperate in defense of their herd and fight against all odds to protect their young. Adults typically walk on the outside of the herd, leaving the young in the middle.

The harmony tree is extremely handsome  graceful and straight, with large yellow flowers, red plumlike fruit, and lush, glossy green leaves the year around. Any creature with intelligence between 2 and 16 (not including robots or androids, but includ- ing cyborgs) that comes within 20 m of a harmony tree must defend vs. a mental attack or become psychologically depen- dent on the tree. Victims are overcome with a feeling of great peace and har- mony, and will be totally unwilling to leave the euphoric atmosphere of the tree or see it harmed in any way. Vic-ims must be killed, stunned, or other- wise subdued if they are to be removed from the trees influence. Once out of range, the victim will recover his or her normal senses. However, victims of a harmony tree are immune to fear gener- ation, mental control, and empathy while under the trees control.Creatures under a harmony trees control feel no need to eat, and they would shudder at the mere idea of hurt- ing any living thing, especially the tree itself. They will not even fight to defend themselves if attacked (but see below). However, if a victim is attacked and hurt, the tree must try to regain control (a mental attack at + 2); if the victim is brought to 10% of his or her hit points, the tree may attack again at no bonus. If this attempt to control the victim fails, the victim is free to escape.If anyone tries to harm the tree, all its victims will attack the offender in a frenzy of blind hatred, using the most effective available attack form at + 4 to hit. In this frenzy, victims will ignore damage to themselves, and can be injured and killed without the tree have- ing to renew its control over them at all. Victims of a harmony tree that are not attacked and killed will slowly, happily starve to death.A harmony tree will keep an entou- rage of as many creatures as possible, since this is its only means of defense. These creatures are often quite varied and even naturally hostile to each other, but they will lie down lovingly together at the base of the harmony tree (this being one way to identify the latter). If a victim is killed or starves to death, the tree will cause the survivors to hide the corpse by burying it or throwing it as far as possible, according to their abili- ties. However, it will have them keep any weapons on the body, as well as any weapons they have themselves, as the guardians may be called upon to use these in defense of the tree. Victims will hide weapons among the branches of the tree or play with them peacefully until someone attacks the tree. In gen- eral, the tree uses the senses of its vic- tims, but they are guided entirely by its intelligence, which may be higher or lower than their own.In any harmony tree encounter, the GM should decide what sort of entou- rage the tree should have, based on the size, status, and overall power of the player character party. There may be nothing but a few dead bodies under the tree, or up to a dozen assorted creatures including a few humans or humanoids with artifacts. Something should almost always be under a harmony tree, since no one can bury the last victims if they all die.The fruit of the harmony tree is inten- sity 7 slow poison. If the tree captures a victim too small to use in its defense (5 HD or less), it may force the victim to eat a fruit and then walk or fly away at normal speed to die within 1-3 hours, starting a new tree. Even after it leaves the 20 m range of the tree, the victim will not regain its senses unless it sur- vives the poisoning, being overcome with misery at having been cast out. This is the way in which the harmony tree propogates itself. A free-willed character that eats a ripe harmony fruit (indistinguishable from an unripe one) will gain four points of mental strength for one hour. Eating unripe harmony fruit will not increase a characters men- tal strength. At any given time, 10% of the fruit on a harmony tree will be ripe. All of it will be poisonous, and of course a character must survive the poison to gain the mental strength.

However, victims of a harmony tree are immune to fear gener- ation, mental control, and empathy while under the trees control.Creatures under a harmony trees control feel no need to eat, and they would shudder at the mere idea of hurt- ing any living thing, especially the tree itself. They will not even fight to defend themselves if attacked (but see below). However, if a victim is attacked and hurt, the tree must try to regain control (a mental attack at + 2); if the victim is brought to 10% of his or her hit points, the tree may attack again at no bonus. If this attempt to control the victim fails, the victim is free to escape.If anyone tries to harm the tree, all its victims will attack the offender in a frenzy of blind hatred, using the most effective available attack form at + 4 to hit. In this frenzy, victims will ignore damage to themselves, and can be injured and killed without the tree have- ing to renew its control over them at all. Victims of a harmony tree that are not attacked and killed will slowly, happily starve to death.A harmony tree will keep an entou- rage of as many creatures as possible, since this is its only means of defense. These creatures are often quite varied and even naturally hostile to each other, but they will lie down lovingly together at the base of the harmony tree (this being one way to identify the latter). If a victim is killed or starves to death, the tree will cause the survivors to hide the corpse by burying it or throwing it as far as possible, according to their abili- ties. However, it will have them keep any weapons on the body, as well as any weapons they have themselves, as the guardians may be called upon to use these in defense of the tree. Victims will hide weapons among the branches of the tree or play with them peacefully until someone attacks the tree. In gen- eral, the tree uses the senses of its vic- tims, but they are guided entirely by its intelligence, which may be higher or lower than their own.In any harmony tree encounter, the GM should decide what sort of entou- rage the tree should have, based on the size, status, and overall power of the player character party. There may be nothing but a few dead bodies under the tree, or up to a dozen assorted creatures including a few humans or humanoids with artifacts. Something should almost always be under a harmony tree, since no one can bury the last victims if they all die.The fruit of the harmony tree is inten- sity 7 slow poison. If the tree captures a victim too small to use in its defense (5 HD or less), it may force the victim to eat a fruit and then walk or fly away at normal speed to die within 1-3 hours, starting a new tree. Even after it leaves the 20 m range of the tree, the victim will not regain its senses unless it sur- vives the poisoning, being overcome with misery at having been cast out. This is the way in which the harmony tree propogates itself. A free-willed character that eats a ripe harmony fruit (indistinguishable from an unripe one) will gain four points of mental strength for one hour. Eating unripe harmony fruit will not increase a characters men- tal strength. At any given time, 10% of the fruit on a harmony tree will be ripe. All of it will be poisonous, and of course a character must survive the poison to gain the mental strength. The poisonous effects of all harmony fruit eaten in one day are cumulative, so two harmony fruit will act as intensity 14 poison.|",4,-3,-2,1,,2,,,3,3,,-2,,,,,,,,Gargantuan,10 Meter Tall,,Dragon 98 - Ares Section June 1985 - GW2,,"SV Fort +1, Ref -2, Will +1",,0,0,84,,,,,,Low Tech Level,,,1,

If they encounter weak or massed animals, they emit the bacteria they kill with. It is released via spiracles in a cloud 15 meters in diameter. This cloud leaves a residue that lasts 4-5 days. Those in the cloud must make a Con check (at -2). Failure means death in 2-5 days. Each beetle can emit this cloud twice per day. Healers can cure this disease fairly easily- all they need is access to 'standard' medicines (GMs decision).Plague beetles live in small egalitarian groups. When they attack a town, each beetle picks a suitable target - inns, taverns, granaries, town halls, and other places where people or food is concentrated. Then each uses the bacteria to wipe out most of the town. After the survivors flee, the Beetles feast.

Unlike most caterpillars with protective coloration, giggle bugs are quite prominent and distinctive: spotted, striped, and checkered in green, yellow, pink, red, blue, and white, with a clownlike false face on each end and mobile projections that resemble pin- wheels and party noisemakers. The effect is magnified by its mutational powers to become highly comical  so much so that most intelligent creatures that see a giggle bug must make a successful check vs. their MS x 2 or collapse in helpless laughter. A new MS check is rolled every 6 action turns after a failed one; if a crea- ture makes a subsequent roll, then it may stop laughing and crawl away. However, if a creature having made a successful MS check continues to look at the caterpillar, however, or even thinks about it clearly enough to make an attack, another MS check is required every action turn.If a creature laughs without rest for more minutes than it has points of CN, then exhaustion sets in, incapacitating the creature for 3 search turns. During this time, the creature may make no attacks, and must move at half speed. Creatures (including PCs) with IN less than 4 or greater than 16 are not affected by the giggle bugs comical appearance. Blind creatures and machines with purely artificial intelligence (like androids and robots) are also immune, but cyborgs, with their human brains, are not.Giggle bugs are immune to all kinds of poison, and they habitually feed on poisonous plants; consequently, their bodies are also poisonous (roll 3d6 for poison intensity for any giggle bug that a character tries to bite or eat). Giggle bugs remain in cater- pillar form from March through November. They pupate in the winter and emerge the following March as huge, gaudy moths that live only long enough to mate and lay eggs.

They will respond to only one master, and will still be easily spooked, though the presence of its master will raise a hopper's morale to 12. Jackalopes have very rough gaits, and a first-time rider is 80% likely to fall off and take 1d6 damage. A trained jackalope can carry one man-sized rider. A hopper with a rider can leap 10 meters, while an unencumbered hopper can leap as far as 15 meters.Hoppers are found in small herds on the plains and grasslands of Gamma Terra. Many cultures have domesticated hoppers as riding animals and (sometimes) beasts of burden, although they're not capable of carrying very heavy loads.

They prey on passerby or scavenger food from the waste of others.  Their dens are usually a small complex of underground tunnels with several shambers and exists.  Squeekers can be domesticated somewhat and trained to severlike guard dogs and hunting animals.  This requires that they be trained from birth and even then can only be accomplished by those immune to their sonic blast mutation.

Evolving over the years from the haphazard exposure to high energy radiation, Maali seem to be the distorted descendents of the North American moose.Their general appearance is still moose-like as they still possess short brown fur and large branching antlers. These bony and sturdy antlers usually grow over a meter in height and are used as deadly weapons by these mutants. Maali are four-legged creatures when travelling over great distances or when running, but through successive mutations they have evolved thick muscular hind legs. A startling development in these mutants was their change from hooven front feet to leathery human-like hands. The combination of strong rear legs and manipulative front hands has permitted these creatures to stand up, walk around, and use tools, weapons, and devices of the Ancients.Outstretched on its hind legs,a Maali stands over 3.5 meters tall. The most amazing aspect of these mutants though is their ability to speak. Rumor has it that they even understand the language of humans! Maali live in forest areas, but they are occasionally found in grassy locales when encountered migrating from one forest to another. They enjoy eating vegetation of all kinds and are known to have enormous appetites.

The probes have radar- and infravision-jam- ming screens (which even affect muta- tions) that allow them to pass by unnoticed.The probes are also equipped with an electrical defense shield that does 1d10 hp damage to characters touching them. The probes themselves cannot attack, and flee as soon as they have registered the posi- tion of the desired hiding group.|",1,-3,-3,-2,,-2,,A/C200,,,,-3,,,,Robot,,,ABCDF (Scent),,,,Dragon Magazine 113,1000,"SV Fort +1, Ref -3, Will -3",,,,18,,,,,,Low Tech Level,,,-3,

All artifacts make them uneasy, and they use only Tech Level I weapons them- selves  notably spears, javelins, blow- guns, bolas, and slings with stones. The blowguns are equipped with insinuative poison needles of poison intensity 9.Combat: They attack almost anything that moves, but are terrified of large, self-propelled machines such as robots and vehicles (they do not usually recognize androids as machines until too late, however). |",2,-1,-1,1,,1,,,6,6,,-1,,,,Monster Race,,,,Small,1 meter tall,,Dragon Magazine 126,,"SV Fort +0, Ref -1, Will -1",,1,1,36,,,,15',,True,,,-1,

They dig their lairs in sand, loose soil, or mud, leaving only their dark brown eyes showing. Unwary creatures have no chance of noticing these eyes. Creatures without heightened vision have only a 2% chance per action turn even if they are scanning the ground in search of a reptoad; creatures with heightened or otherwise highly superior vision have a 10% chance per action turn, and creatures with heightened or otherwise highly supe- rior smell have a 5% chance per action turn of locating a reptoad if they are actively trying.The mastery that reptoads have gained over force fields and repulsion fields is unparalleled in GAMMA WORLD game lands. Like standard repulsion fields, these fields last as long as the creature concen- trates on them. Reptoads can create an unlimited number each day. However, the reptoad has developed concentrative powers sufficient to maintain up to eight repulsion fields at the same time. The fields have a surface area of no more than 24 square meters, and must remain within 20 meters of the toad, but within those strictures, a reptoad can shape its repul- sion fields into any shape it wants  a 2-meter cube, a circular band to bind opponents together, a 2 x 8 x 8 meter cage (with repulsion field bars and gaps between), or a toad-shaped force field. (Reptoads keep any one of these fields around their bodies at all times.) When it wishes to eat, a reptoad simply puts up an outside repulsion field around itself and its prey, and only then takes down the inside one surrounding itself; thus, it is never vulnerable.All of a reptoads repulsion fields are proof against any normal physical attack; physical objects cannot pass through or damage the field. Also, laser, blaster, and energy-weapon attacks cannot pass through the field, but they can hit and automatically do normal damage to it. Each field has 50 hit points, but the reptoad can instantly renew any broken repulsion field if it is alive, conscious, and still within range. Radiation, heat, cold, gas, mental attacks and stun rays do not affect the repulsion field; these attacks pass through the field, although the first three attacks cannot harm a reptoad.Twice per day, a reptoad can also create a long-lasting repulsion field identical to the others in every way except that it does not require the toads continued concen- tration to keep it up. These shields stand for 50 + 1d100 days or until destroyed by energy attacks, even if the reptoad dies, is stunned, or goes away. The area around a reptoads lair is often cluttered with old, forgotten, invisible cages.Reptoads are vicious and cruel, hating all larger forms of terrestrial life. Their favor- ite pastime is to trap creatures in repul- sion fields and watch them slowly dehydrate or starve to death. Fortunately, reptoads have never been known to coop- erate with anyone  not even the Red Death. They care nothing for treasure or artifacts.

2023-04-07-Robotic-Hunter-Manhunter.md,Robotic Hunter «Manhunter»,2023-04-07 08:37:35,Gamma World|Bestiary|Mutant Crawl Classics,"This incredibly fast tracking and killing machine was designed for unknown purposes about which Gamma World sages can only speculate. Its abilities and functions make it a perfect construct for following and killing oppo- nents, but the original need for the heavy armor and weaponry of the Manhunter is unknown. The unit may possibly have been used to defeat rogue Defense Borgs and Warbots, in conjunction with several others of its kind. Other uses may have included assaults on advanced-tech gue- rilla squads, but this is not known for sure.The Manhunter is an exceptionally pow- erful robot, but is extremely rare and found only in the surrounding areas of the Cybernetic Installations they were com- manded to guard. Others can possibly be found patrolling vast regions, still follow- ing ancient, outdated programs. They ignore all beings that are not directly affected by their missions, unless foolish characters attack them. As with other units of the Hunter class, the Manhunter continues to follow its mission until com- pleted, ignoring all other commands from any source.This 16-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, 2- meter-high hunting and tracking machine is covered in weapons and sensors. On each side of the unit are 2-meter-long, 1-meter-wide, and 1-meter-high ovoids stored in depressions (these are the cyber robots detailed below). Near the back of the Manhunter are four smaller ovoids (only .5 meters long) stacked in a row, their front ends aimed forward. On the bottom of the robot is a faint outline of a hatch (leading to the stasis chamber) and many projections surrounding it (the pres- sor/tractor beam). On the upper side are the main batteries of weapons and most of the tracking equipment. The sides of the unit are fitted with all of its close-range weaponry.The Manhunter is capable of using all weapons and defenses (including screens and fields) simultaneously. For long-range and immediate killing purposes, the Manhunter has several effective weapons. The unit has a battery of two lasers at- tached to each of twelve optical scanners; each has a range of 500 meters and does 10d6 hp damage per battery. A photonrifle that delivers 18-intensity radiation has a range of 300 meters and a weapon class of 5. Four automatic rifles that have a range of 200 meters and do 10d10 hp damage per burst are included, each equipped with enough ammunition forfive bursts. Two micro-missile launchers with 2d10 missiles are on the sides, each with a range of 1000 meters. One top- mounted mini-missile launcher with 1d10 missiles has a range of 3000 meters and can be fired individually or simultaneously with the micro-missile launcher.Two black ray guns (front- and rear- mounted) have a range of 200 meters, and a laser cannon (front-mounted) does 20d6 hp damage and has a range of 1000 me- ters. A fusion cannon that does the same damage as a fusion bomb but only has a range of 50 meters is centered on the top. A molecular disruptor that has the same effects as the mutation molecular disrup- tion, but has a range of 150 meters and twice the normal chances of disruption, is also top-mounted (on the robots front). A fission gun occupies an upper-rear plat- form, having a ray with the same effect as a dirty fission bomb, with a range of 4000 meters and a weapon class of 16. A top- mounted bomb launcher that has a range of 750 meters is able to fire the following bombs: matter bombs (up to four Alpha, two Beta, or one Delta), fusion bombs(only two), clean fission bombs (only two), mutation bombs (up to four), and negation bombs (up to four). Only one type of bomb load may be carried.The Manhunter also has a grenade launcher (with capacity for up to 100 grenades of any type) that has a range of 150 meters and is used to ferret out hid-den individuals and destroy buildings. The unit has a stun-missile launcher equipped with six stun missiles; each missile has a range of 500 meters and has the effect of stunning everyone within a 30-meter range of the impact for 2d4 search turns. Both weapons are side-mounted on oppo- site sides of the robot  left for the gre- nade launcher and right for the stun-missile rack.Two forward-mounted Mark VI rifles and a battery of four stun-ray rifles (two front, two rear, all bottom-mounted) round out most of the long-range offensive weap- onry. The unit is fitted with a forward- underside taser rifle that has a range of 1000 meters and does 4d8 hp damage, wrapping a cable around the character; only a combined or individual strength of 21 or greater can free a trapped victim (see the Robohunter for details on this weapon). Fifty spare cables are included.A battery of four razor rifles is mounted on the forward underside of the robot. They have a range of 90 meters and each do 8d6 hp damage per hit (causing an additional 1d4 hp damage of bleeding per action turn until blades are removed and wounds are healed). For close-range com- bat, there is a needler rifle with needles coated in a sleep-inducing serum. This serum causes characters to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns. The needler is another front-underside weapon.The Manhunter has several weapon devices not described elsewhere. The unit can spray a heavy nerve-affecting gas. This heavy gas flows down to the lowest level possible (draining into holes) and causes creatures caught in the cloud to save against the effects by rolling under their constitution on d20. Characters who fail this roll are totally unable to perform any movement voluntarily (involuntary muscles such as the heart and lungs still function normally) for 4d20 action turns. Twelve vents (six per side) spread the gas in a 20-meter radius around the robot. Enough gas for six uses is provided.Another gas that can be sprayed up to 20 meters away affects only metallic ob- jects. This gas coats such objects with a chemical that, in two action turns, turns the metal into a frail glasslike substance. Any object coated with this gas is de- stroyed if struck against any hard surface and melts if it is a heat-using device (such as a laser pistol). The chemical must be washed off as soon as it comes into con- tact with metal to counter the damage. The Manhunter is coated with a substance that makes it immune to the gas itself, unless the covering of the robot is cracked to admit the gas into its interior.The Manhunter can also drop a canister that explodes on impact, sending special particles raining down on the ground below. These particles cover a 50-meter- radius area and only affect organic mate- rial (characters totally covered in metallic or plastic armor are unaffected). The robot has only four of these cannisters. Attacked creatures suffer 1d6 damage per action turn for 1d4 turns (while particles are still in the air). Unless affected victims made a CON  2 check on percentile dice, they lose 1d10 points of strength, dexter- ity, and constitution as well for 2d8 hours (no score can drop below 1).The Manhunter also has a force-field destroyer that inflicts 100 hp of damage to all force fields within a 100-meter range, but it wont affect unprotected characters. A force field that can sustain up to 200 hp of damage per action turn is part of the Manhunters protection. The hull of the robot is covered in a thick duralloy shield- ing that allows the unit to operate under- sea or in near vacuum conditions. A reflective hull causes laser attacks to do up to half damage on hits (the robot can take 200 hp of damage from lasers until the reflective ability is destroyed and laser attacks are then made at normal damage).The robot is surrounded by a paralysis field that has a range of 20 meters. This field stuns characters as the paralysis rod can, and it allows the Manhunter to make attacks that automatically hit the para- lyzed victims. This field has enough power for 30 action turns of use.The Manhunter itself is equipped with a holographic projector, which it can use to make itself appear invisible or camou- flaged in the surrounding vegetation.There is a 1% chance per action turn that the projection will flicker, allowing onlook- ers to realize the deception and make attacks as normal until the Manhunter leaves the area. While hunting or tracking, the robot is totally soundless and surprises characters on a roll of 1-5 on d6.A robotic deactivation/activation field can be used up to 200 meters away. The robots can also be controlled by special circuits as if the Manhunter had Stage IV I.D.Herbicides and fungicides can besprayed over an area of 100-meters radius per use (10 such uses possible) to destroy ground cover for hiding fugitives. The unit can immerse its entire self in water, but is incapable of combat while in this environ- ment. It has special remote-controlled drone units which are described below.",,AC 11,,,1,,atk see description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scott A.

As with other units of the Hunter class, the Manhunter continues to follow its mission until com- pleted, ignoring all other commands from any source.This 16-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, 2- meter-high hunting and tracking machine is covered in weapons and sensors. On each side of the unit are 2-meter-long, 1-meter-wide, and 1-meter-high ovoids stored in depressions (these are the cyber robots detailed below). Near the back of the Manhunter are four smaller ovoids (only .5 meters long) stacked in a row, their front ends aimed forward. On the bottom of the robot is a faint outline of a hatch (leading to the stasis chamber) and many projections surrounding it (the pres- sor/tractor beam). On the upper side are the main batteries of weapons and most of the tracking equipment. The sides of the unit are fitted with all of its close-range weaponry.The Manhunter is capable of using all weapons and defenses (including screens and fields) simultaneously. For long-range and immediate killing purposes, the Manhunter has several effective weapons. The unit has a battery of two lasers at- tached to each of twelve optical scanners; each has a range of 500 meters and does 10d6 hp damage per battery. A photonrifle that delivers 18-intensity radiation has a range of 300 meters and a weapon class of 5. Four automatic rifles that have a range of 200 meters and do 10d10 hp damage per burst are included, each equipped with enough ammunition forfive bursts. Two micro-missile launchers with 2d10 missiles are on the sides, each with a range of 1000 meters. One top- mounted mini-missile launcher with 1d10 missiles has a range of 3000 meters and can be fired individually or simultaneously with the micro-missile launcher.Two black ray guns (front- and rear- mounted) have a range of 200 meters, and a laser cannon (front-mounted) does 20d6 hp damage and has a range of 1000 me- ters. A fusion cannon that does the same damage as a fusion bomb but only has a range of 50 meters is centered on the top. A molecular disruptor that has the same effects as the mutation molecular disrup- tion, but has a range of 150 meters and twice the normal chances of disruption, is also top-mounted (on the robots front). A fission gun occupies an upper-rear plat- form, having a ray with the same effect as a dirty fission bomb, with a range of 4000 meters and a weapon class of 16. A top- mounted bomb launcher that has a range of 750 meters is able to fire the following bombs: matter bombs (up to four Alpha, two Beta, or one Delta), fusion bombs(only two), clean fission bombs (only two), mutation bombs (up to four), and negation bombs (up to four). Only one type of bomb load may be carried.The Manhunter also has a grenade launcher (with capacity for up to 100 grenades of any type) that has a range of 150 meters and is used to ferret out hid-den individuals and destroy buildings. The unit has a stun-missile launcher equipped with six stun missiles; each missile has a range of 500 meters and has the effect of stunning everyone within a 30-meter range of the impact for 2d4 search turns. Both weapons are side-mounted on oppo- site sides of the robot  left for the gre- nade launcher and right for the stun-missile rack.Two forward-mounted Mark VI rifles and a battery of four stun-ray rifles (two front, two rear, all bottom-mounted) round out most of the long-range offensive weap- onry. The unit is fitted with a forward- underside taser rifle that has a range of 1000 meters and does 4d8 hp damage, wrapping a cable around the character; only a combined or individual strength of 21 or greater can free a trapped victim (see the Robohunter for details on this weapon). Fifty spare cables are included.A battery of four razor rifles is mounted on the forward underside of the robot. They have a range of 90 meters and each do 8d6 hp damage per hit (causing an additional 1d4 hp damage of bleeding per action turn until blades are removed and wounds are healed). For close-range com- bat, there is a needler rifle with needles coated in a sleep-inducing serum. This serum causes characters to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns. The needler is another front-underside weapon.The Manhunter has several weapon devices not described elsewhere. The unit can spray a heavy nerve-affecting gas. This heavy gas flows down to the lowest level possible (draining into holes) and causes creatures caught in the cloud to save against the effects by rolling under their constitution on d20. Characters who fail this roll are totally unable to perform any movement voluntarily (involuntary muscles such as the heart and lungs still function normally) for 4d20 action turns. Twelve vents (six per side) spread the gas in a 20-meter radius around the robot. Enough gas for six uses is provided.Another gas that can be sprayed up to 20 meters away affects only metallic ob- jects. This gas coats such objects with a chemical that, in two action turns, turns the metal into a frail glasslike substance. Any object coated with this gas is de- stroyed if struck against any hard surface and melts if it is a heat-using device (such as a laser pistol). The chemical must be washed off as soon as it comes into con- tact with metal to counter the damage. The Manhunter is coated with a substance that makes it immune to the gas itself, unless the covering of the robot is cracked to admit the gas into its interior.The Manhunter can also drop a canister that explodes on impact, sending special particles raining down on the ground below. These particles cover a 50-meter- radius area and only affect organic mate- rial (characters totally covered in metallic or plastic armor are unaffected). The robot has only four of these cannisters. Attacked creatures suffer 1d6 damage per action turn for 1d4 turns (while particles are still in the air). Unless affected victims made a CON  2 check on percentile dice, they lose 1d10 points of strength, dexter- ity, and constitution as well for 2d8 hours (no score can drop below 1).The Manhunter also has a force-field destroyer that inflicts 100 hp of damage to all force fields within a 100-meter range, but it wont affect unprotected characters. A force field that can sustain up to 200 hp of damage per action turn is part of the Manhunters protection. The hull of the robot is covered in a thick duralloy shield- ing that allows the unit to operate under- sea or in near vacuum conditions. A reflective hull causes laser attacks to do up to half damage on hits (the robot can take 200 hp of damage from lasers until the reflective ability is destroyed and laser attacks are then made at normal damage).The robot is surrounded by a paralysis field that has a range of 20 meters. This field stuns characters as the paralysis rod can, and it allows the Manhunter to make attacks that automatically hit the para- lyzed victims. This field has enough power for 30 action turns of use.The Manhunter itself is equipped with a holographic projector, which it can use to make itself appear invisible or camou- flaged in the surrounding vegetation.There is a 1% chance per action turn that the projection will flicker, allowing onlook- ers to realize the deception and make attacks as normal until the Manhunter leaves the area. While hunting or tracking, the robot is totally soundless and surprises characters on a roll of 1-5 on d6.A robotic deactivation/activation field can be used up to 200 meters away. The robots can also be controlled by special circuits as if the Manhunter had Stage IV I.D.Herbicides and fungicides can besprayed over an area of 100-meters radius per use (10 such uses possible) to destroy ground cover for hiding fugitives. The unit can immerse its entire self in water, but is incapable of combat while in this environ- ment.

2023-04-07-Robotic-Hunter-Tracker-Robohunter.md,Robotic Hunter/Tracker «Robohunter»,2023-04-07 08:37:35,Gamma World|Bestiary|Mutant Crawl Classics,"The Robohunter was specifically constructed for several track- ing purposes, including the ability to fol- low escaping creatures over any type of terrain. The Robohunter was designed for use with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow era, but is now normally controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals (making them very trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the few remaining resistant animal population (those creatures that were not affected by the radiation). It was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the needed function. Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much modified by post-holocaust humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far beyond what would logi- cally be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can never harm crea- tures of Pure Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with non-obvious physical mutations), but always tries to kill or capture any creatures of mutated stock, as well as all characters that have muta- tions which obviously separate them from pure stock. The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and anything that attacks it (including PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms. Due to its pro- gramming, the Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes until whatever current mission it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears as a massive, large-proportioned humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively hidden by a holographic projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental coloring as if it had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings cover the outside of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp duralloy shards that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other units in the Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its weaponry simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and their functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged by an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be charged to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable is fired at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims skin. The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to wrap around a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of 21 or greater to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage), another replaces it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati- cally. The weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter are separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16 and a range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at crea- tures. These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage from bleeding per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area is treated. The razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered by two solar energy cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head of the Robohunter has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached to one side is a flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10 hp damage and has enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire spreading to flammable materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet also has an optical weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive energy in any direction the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect as the mutation radiation eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation like the mutation. This attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy cell source is drained and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from the back of the Robohunter, allowing it to attack in all directions at once in hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10 meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored in the lower chest area of the Robohunter are three magnetic seal nets that are the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter. The Robohunter also has a needler pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful sleeping serum. This serum will cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle. This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10 hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and the weapon has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three hydro- gen energy cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built into the left arm of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter can utilize a modern spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does 3d8 hp damage. The device has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong line that allows the Robohunter to automatically retrieve its spears, as well as dead creatures. The Robohunter is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen energy cell that allows 10 shots. This weapon can only be used in underwater environments and is part of the right arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual defenses. A magnetic field can be created that can either be used to repel or attract small metallic objects near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings, these small objects may be retained only if the being holding them has a strength of 18 or greater. If this field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed buildings, then the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage unless braced against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto- matically to make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field also allows the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials that can be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn. This field has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters can also be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis rod. The field also causes its victim(s) to fall into unconsciousness and not be awakened for 4d4 hours. Plants are not affected by this field, but beings with organic brains are.An energy field that surrounds the Ro- bohunters surface at a 2-centimeter-wide layer does 3d10 hp damage to characters coming into contact with it. The entire duralloy surface of the Robohunter is covered in sharp metallic protrusions, similar to a sharks rough skin (only magni- fied in effect). Individuals pressed against this surface or held there by the robot suffer 2d4 hp damage. The Robohunter may also attempt to bear-hug any crea- ture. This hug requires two consecutive successful fist attacks. Trapped characters take 6d4 hp damage per action turn until dead or rescued.Various equipment and items used for other purposes of tracking and hunting are also present in the Robohunters con- struction. Although not originally planned for offensive use, some of the devices can cause damage. Acid spray was used to destroy the remains of a hunted animal; it can be fired up to 10 meters away and causes 1d8 hp damage per turn until washed away or neutralized. The Robo- hunter has enough acid for 20 spray at- tacks. Two vibro saws used for cutting through dense underbrush can be used to attack and have abilities similar to the vibro blade. Each vibro saw does 8d6 hp damage.The Robohunter is also equipped with herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides (as detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game), used in sprayers to help in the pursuit of deadly game. A sonic torch used for de- stroying structures and large obstructions does 8d6 hp damage per action turn and is capable of cutting through duralloy walls in 10 action turns (allowing enough space for the Robohunter to pass through). The sonic torch has enough power for one hour of use. A tractor/pressor beam capa- ble of moving up to 1000 kilograms at a 30-meter range is also included.The Robohunter has radar/sonar func- tions that are capable of detecting crea- tures up to 100 meters away, allowing the robot to never be surprised, save by tele- porting beings. There is also a medi-kit for use on captured animals (which works as a normal medi-kit on mutated animals). The bot is sealed for underwater use and is able to move 50 meters per turn in this environment. The Robohunter is also able to skim across the surface of land with the aid of anti-grav pods. The Robohunter can obtain only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and defenses normally while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable of changing their structure to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter can resemble the following robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot, Medical Robot, Security Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action turns of inactivity, and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed appearance. The Robohunter has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control other robots as if it had a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive changing ability described above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions made by Knights of Genetic Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable of sustaining 40 hp damage before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp damage before being useless.

The Robohunter was designed for use with the tracking of creatures during the Pre-Shadow era, but is now normally controlled and responsive to the pursuit of mutated animals (making them very trea- sured by the Knights of Genetic Purity), as well as the few remaining resistant animal population (those creatures that were not affected by the radiation). It was used to either capture or destroy prey, depending on the needed function. Gamma World sages speculate that this type of unit has been much modified by post-holocaust humans because of the robots extreme deadliness, far beyond what would logi- cally be required of an animal hunter.The Robohunter can never harm crea- tures of Pure Strain Human appearance (including humanoids with non-obvious physical mutations), but always tries to kill or capture any creatures of mutated stock, as well as all characters that have muta- tions which obviously separate them from pure stock. The Robohunter only de- stroys its objective and anything that attacks it (including PSH characters), ig- noring all other life forms. Due to its pro- gramming, the Robohunter cannot be commanded for other purposes until whatever current mission it possesses is completed.The Robohunter appears as a massive, large-proportioned humanoid. It has a height of 4 meters and is actively hidden by a holographic projector. This device allows the robot to have environmental coloring as if it had the chameleon powers mutation. Various equipment and housings cover the outside of the Robohunter. The surface of the body is covered in sharp duralloy shards that do not affect any of its functions.As with all of the other units in the Hunter robot class, the Robohunter is capable of utilizing all of its weaponry simultaneously. Included in its vast arsenal are several weapons not detailed in the GAMMA WORLD game booklets. Unless detailed elsewhere, these weapons and their functions should only be used in conjunction with the Hunter-class robots.Placed in the robots upper chest is a taser rifle with a range of 100 meters, charged by an atomic energy cell that allows 20 shots; a supply of 20 cables is also provided for use with this weapon. The weapons damage is variable; a taser cable can be charged to do from 1d8 to 4d8 hp damage to a victim, once the dural- loy cable is fired at an opponent and deliv- ers its electrical damage directly to the victims skin. The cable is also equipped with magnetic seals that enable the cable to wrap around a victim. These cables require a combined or singular strength of 21 or greater to pry apart. If a cable is destroyed (each takes 10 hp damage), another replaces it. Cable-wrapped charac- ters can be hit by other weapons automati- cally. The weapon class of the taser rifle is 16.Built into the hands of the Robohunter are separately powered razor pistols. These devices have a weapon class of 16 and a range of 80 meters. A razor pistol fires a stream of duralloy shards at crea- tures. These shards do 8d8 hp damage per hit; victims take 1d4 hp damage from bleeding per action turn until the shards are removed and the damaged area is treated. The razor pistol has enough ammunition for 15 shots and is powered by two solar energy cells that allow for 15 shots to be fired per charge.The head of the Robohunter has been made with several offensive purposes in mind. Attached to one side is a flamethro- wing device with a weapon class of 16. It does 8d10 hp damage and has enough flammable gas for six shots. The possibility of the fire spreading to flammable materi- als is up to the Game Masters discretion. The helmet also has an optical weapon built in; this eye is capable of firing radioactive energy in any direction the Robohunter is facing. This weapon has the same effect as the mutation radiation eyes, and fires a beam of Intensity Level 3d6 radiation like the mutation. This attack can only be used 10 times, until the atomic energy cell source is drained and must be recharged.Two robotic tentacles spring from the back of the Robohunter, allowing it to attack in all directions at once in hand-to- hand combat. These tentacles do 1d8 hp damage and are capable of lifting and throwing up to 200 kilograms 10 meters away, causing 2d6 hp damage. Stored in the lower chest area of the Robohunter are three magnetic seal nets that are the same in detail as those of the Cybohunter. The Robohunter also has a needler pistol that contains needles coated in a powerful sleeping serum. This serum will cause the victim to fall asleep for 4d10 action turns unless he rolls under his individual consti- tution score on a d20. The pistol is built into the robots chest.The Robohunter is also armed with an automatic rifle. This rifle is capable of firing a steady stream of duralloy bullets that do 10d10 hp damage per burst. Only one burst can be fired per action turn, and the weapon has a range of 200 meters and a class of 16. It is powered by three hydro- gen energy cells and has enough ammo for five bursts. This weapon is built into the left arm of the robotic unit.For underwater hunting, the Robohun- ter can utilize a modern spear gun. This spear gun has a range of 20 meters and does 3d8 hp damage. The device has a weapon class of 12 and is attached to a strong line that allows the Robohunter to automatically retrieve its spears, as well as dead creatures. The Robohunter is equipped with two spears and one hydro- gen energy cell that allows 10 shots. This weapon can only be used in underwater environments and is part of the right arm of the robot.The Robohunter has numerous unusual defenses. A magnetic field can be created that can either be used to repel or attract small metallic objects near the robot (like guns). If held by living beings, these small objects may be retained only if the being holding them has a strength of 18 or greater. If this field is activated when the robot is near large metal-constructed buildings, then the robot itself is drawn to the building and takes 2d6 hp damage unless braced against the building before- hand (a Robohunter scans its area auto- matically to make sure this wont happen, but the unit can be tricked). This field also allows the bot to climb vertical surfaces made of duralloy or other materials that can be magnetically charged, moving at the rate of 20 meters per action turn. This field has a range of 50 meters.A paralysis field that has a range of 10 meters can also be activated. This field causes effects much the same as the paral- ysis rod.

The Robohunter can obtain only a maximum altitude of 2 me- ters, but can use all weapons and defenses normally while in the air.Oddly enough, some Robohunters are capable of changing their structure to avoid recognition by animal prey. Such a Robohunter can resemble the following robots: Engineering Bot  Light, General Household Robot, Medical Robot, Security Robot, or Supervisory Borg. This change requires two action turns of inactivity, and all attacks and defenses are kept while in the changed appearance. The Robohunter has radio-controlling circuits which allow it to control other robots as if it had a Stage IV I.D., which further enhances the deceptive changing ability described above. These functions appear to be re- cent additions made by Knights of Genetic Purity or other groups.The arms of this unit are capable of sustaining 40 hp damage before being destroyed, and the tentacles take 30 hp damage before being useless. A fist strike from a Robohunter does 4d6 hp damage.|",10,6,2,16,,12,,A/D400,75,75,,2,,,,Robot,,,ABDEF (Scent),,,,Dragon Magazine 113,Rank,"SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +1",,,,378,,,,90',,Low Tech Level,,,1,

The corpse of any human or humonoid creature killed by a screamer slowly metamorphs itself into a screamer the nightfall following the day of its death. The only way to prevent this is to completely destroy the body before the change is effected. From mere wounds inflicted by screamers, however, one recovers in a normal manner.Screamers appear as emaciated and shrunken humanoids with yellowish-grey skin. They are usually clad in the rotting remains of what was once normal clothing. The heads of screamers are brutally hairless and their faces have disappeared, mutated and melted into a glistening, featureless mass of sickly- colored flesh. Only a formless, cavernous, toothless mouth is still discernible. From this mouth come the unnerving moans, shrieks, and howls that give the creature its name. Though unable to communicate verbally and seemingly not capable of rational thought as we understand it, screamers appear to have a highly developed, instinctive sense of balance and direction.Radiation causes screamers to emit a bluish-green glow, the brightness of which varies according to the level of screaming maintained by the creature.AII screamers are totally immune to laser, radiation. stun, poison, heat and cold-based attacks.

They establish territorial areas across sea beds, defending them fiercely (even against ships and submarines just passing by). Being particularly stupid and rather clumsy, draguns may be slowed and stopped by heavy, steel cable nets dropped across their paths. They seem to like basking on the surface of the ocean during sunny days, and they are often encountered during these times.Draguns possess a rudimentary form of communication consisting of bellows, croaks, and grunts, all of which are uttered while the dragun is floating on the surface. Mutant reptiles may learn to imitate these sounds with some success (50% chance of getting a vocalization correct), and this technique, coupled with an amplifier, has been used to attract or drive away these beasts.Draguns have three forms of attack. They prefer to bite and swallow prey that is man sized or smaller, there being a 15% chance per bite that such prey is gulped down whole. A swallowed character takes 2d6 damage per action turn from slow suffocation and drowning on water the dragun swallowed, plus an amount equal to his or her base AC from digestive acids. The victim may only attack with daggers. claws, or teeth against the dragun's insides (AC 9). The dragun must be slain in order for a victim to be removed. Once this is done, 100 points of damage must be inflicted on the dead dragun's midsection, either by persons outside the dragun or by a swallowed victim, to free the captive. Note that a dead dragun floats easily and can be towed to land.Draguns also like to ram ships and other creatures that are floating on the surface of the water, using their snouts as battering rams. A vessel of sailboat size or smaller is 90% likely to capsize if rammed; a ship the size of a sailed frigate would have a 5% chance of rolling over.Finally, draguns have a New Body Part: a gizzard that collects large stones and can expel them forcefully out of the dragun's open mouth. A fired stone weighs 2d4 kilograms, has a 40 meter range, and does 6d6 points of damage to whatever it strikes. Draguns only fire stones when floating, not underwater. Because of this effect, and because of the blasting sound made when the stone is launched, the original name of `dragon'was modified to its current form. A dragun has 1d4 such stones which may be fired at any particular time.If a dragun senses any sort of poison gas on the water's surface, it immediately submerges and flees the area.",/RPG/MCC-GW/images/Monster-Manual/Draguns.png,AC 12,All,,2,,atk bite melee +11 (1d30+6) and ram melee +11 (1d30+6),1 Bite (42),30,Bite,6,11,1,,melee,1 Ram (40),30,Ram,6,11,1,,melee,,,,,,,,,,Danny Moynihan,,American alligator,,,,,,2,2,,,13,13,,Sea Gators,,Draguns,Draguns,52,"Description: Draguns still resemble their ancestral alligator forms, though they are much larger and cannot leave the water.

An ameebie has two forms. The first is that of an amophous blob, roughly 2-3 m in diameter. The blob is omnivorous and attacks living prey by attempting to stretch out, envelope, and smother the victim. A successful to hit roll means the ameebie has extended a pseudopod and successfully covered the victims face. (Being rather intelligent, the ameebie knows where to aim.) The victim takes 2d6 damage per Action Turn there- after until either it or the ameebie is slain. Blunt weapons (clubs, maces, etc.) do no damage to the ameebie in this form, as it can reshape itself to absorb the blows impact.The ameebie's second form is that of a humanoid being, devoid of facial features, hair, and so forth. This form is about 1.5 m tall, and takes 2 Action Turns without interruption to assume. In this form, the ameebie cannot digest prey, as it is using all of its energy to maintain the humanoid shape. It is not known if ameebies can assume other forms.Ameebies cannot be affected by cold. They automatically form a hard, rubbery surface when subjected to cold tempera- tures, and actually gain 1 armor class level for every 10 hit points of cold damagethey absorb (even from mutant cold-generating powers). The lowest armor class they can attain is AC 3.Ameebies are quite intelligent and may join adventuring parties out of curiosity. They see by using thousands of minute eyespots over their bodies. Though severely myopic (missing all objects fur- ther than 10 m away), they cannot be surprised within their limited visual range. Ameebies are deaf, but have normal senses of touch. They eat any organic matter, being immune to poisons. Some ameebies have learned to communicate with other beings using very rudimentary sign language. They also regenerate any physical damage they take.Nothing is known about how ameebies reproduce, though it is guessed that they use budding or fission.

An ameebie has two forms. The first is that of an amophous blob, roughly 2-3 m in diameter. The blob is omnivorous and attacks living prey by attempting to stretch out, envelope, and smother the victim. A successful to hit roll means the ameebie has extended a pseudopod and successfully covered the victims face. (Being rather intelligent, the ameebie knows where to aim.) The victim takes 2d6 damage per Action Turn there- after until either it or the ameebie is slain. Blunt weapons (clubs, maces, etc.) do no damage to the ameebie in this form, as it can reshape itself to absorb the blows impact.The ameebie's second form is that of a humanoid being, devoid of facial features, hair, and so forth. This form is about 1.5 m tall, and takes 2 Action Turns without interruption to assume. In this form, the ameebie cannot digest prey, as it is using all of its energy to maintain the humanoid shape. It is not known if ameebies can assume other forms.Ameebies cannot be affected by cold. They automatically form a hard, rubbery surface when subjected to cold tempera- tures, and actually gain 1 armor class level for every 10 hit points of cold damagethey absorb (even from mutant cold-generating powers). The lowest armor class they can attain is AC 3.Ameebies are quite intelligent and may join adventuring parties out of curiosity. They see by using thousands of minute eyespots over their bodies. Though severely myopic (missing all objects fur- ther than 10 m away), they cannot be surprised within their limited visual range. Ameebies are deaf, but have normal senses of touch. They eat any organic matter, being immune to poisons. Some ameebies have learned to communicate with other beings using very rudimentary sign language. They also regenerate any physical damage they take.Nothing is known about how ameebies reproduce, though it is guessed that they use budding or fission. Ameebies cannot be contacted by using telepathic powers of any sort.

It's back and wings are it's primary defense, they are completely impervious to all forms of physical attacks, lasers and radiation type weapons, And since they have chameleon capabilities, it's extremely possible to not even see the actual attack on the ground.  Shutters are solitary animals and will only be in numbers of 2 during mating. They are attracted to heat and bright lights. The name ""Shutters"" comes from the unconscious twitching they display while they sleep clinging to a tree. This motion temporally negates their chameleon bonuses and makes them more easily visible. Of course when they cling in this manner they only expose their wings and back , protecting their soft underbellies.(AC of only 5) When they cling in this manner, they cannot be forcefully removed, unless a well orchestrated combined PS of 40 is applied. Even in death, the creatures remain affixed. For obvious reasons, the Shutters' wings are very valuable in Gamma Terra, and will fetch the handsome price of 8,500 domars for just 1 of a set of wings.|",4,6,0,10,,4,,,31,31,,0,,,,,,,,Large,3 Meters,,MM2,,"SV Fort +1, Ref +0, Will +1",,0,0,144,,,,8',,Low Tech Level,,,1,

They are intensely curious beings, and they love to collect small pieces of both metal and plastic, espe- cially if they are shiny, have strange shapes, or are in some other way attrac- tive to the garrel. Because of this, gar- rels often unwittingly have one or two small artifacts in their possession, mak- ing them targets for treasure hunters(especially for Archivists). However, it is unlikely that the garrels need fear extinction at the hands of such as these.When not gathering food, a garrel is always on the lookout for new items to add to its collection. Anyone who camps in or near a forest inhabited by garrels can expect at least one of these creatures to be lurking nearby, just out of sight. The garrel will wait until it sees something attractive thats also unguarded. It will then use its teleport object ability to gain possession of the item and will then return to its lair, most often a hollow tree trunk or a small burrow, where the garrel will put the item with the others it has accumulated.If a garrel is attacked, either by a predator or by angry beings whose equipment has been borrowed,"" its first reaction will be to flee, holding any treasures it has acquired for as long as it can, using its speed, agility, tree-climbing skills, and any available foliage to speed its escape. Garrels prefer forests with a thick blanket of undergrowth so that they can lose pursuit with a minimum of effort. During the chase, the garrel will trust its displacement ability to send it to safety if it is at any time in imminent danger of being killed.If displacement cannot be used, the garrel will then use its stunning force to buy time. Garrels are immune to the effects of another garrels stunning force attack.

In appearance, these malevolent creatures have the synthesized features of a man and a gargantuan insect. The creatures are bipedal (standing between 150-200 centimeters) and have only two arms. Their bloated abdomen and thorax are connected to a large head complete with long, fern-like antennae and broad mandibles.When attacking, Buggers either strike with their two claws and bite for 1-6, 1-6, and 1-10 points respectively or they can use a crude weapon such as an axe, sword, or mace. When using a weapon the creatures can also bite.These termite men live within nests made up of a myriad of burrowed passages and chambers. Due to the lack of light in the Buggem nests, the creatures hove developed heightened senses that allow the Buggers to see in the dark. Buggem nests ore found in almost all climes and are easily recognizable by the prominent mound of dirt formed over the opening into their chambers. Like any of their smaller relations these termite creatures are primarily fungus eaters, raising their own food supply deep within their dark burrows in strange fungus gardens.Although they prefer to remain in their nests, Buggers must occasionally venture outside to get hosts for their parasitic infants. These hosts ore invariably humanoid and always perish during the eventual hatching of the young. In a world of far more dangerous creatures, the Buggem species survives partially due to two unique mutations that occur occasionally among their kind. Appearing in one creature out of twenty, the Buggers' first mutation is that of gas generation. Several different types of gas are possible with varying probability of appearance.

They inhabit ruins instead of populated cities because of their talent for turning popu- lated cities into deserted ruins. They are prolific and voracious, and there is vir- tually no way to remove them from any sort of building. Furthermore, they frequently (GMs option) carry terrible diseases similar to those used by plants with the bacterial symbiosis mutation. Encroaches are very fast for their size, but they are unintelligent and generally do not move more than a few meters in a straight line. It is their habit to spread their kind by hitching rides on more mobile creatures when the local popula- tion reaches saturation point or the food supply is exhausted (which is virtually always). Character parties will encounter encroaches in abandoned storerooms and kitchens. The little insects will pour out of cupboards and containers and try to crawl all over the party. They can be outrun by creatures faster than themsel- ves who are not surprised. Otherwise, nothing will prevent each and every character from being literally covered with encroaches. Encroaches are immune to all forms of electromagnetic, thermal and nuclear attack (and to poison as well); only direct kinetic force (squashing) will harm them. It is futile attack them en masse, since each one that is killed will be replaced tenfold. Slapping, picking off and stomping, rolling on the ground, and similar strate- gies will kill all but 1-10 per character. These will remain on a characters per- son or in his or her gear until they are brought to a new environment (which need not be too far away from the old environment) where there is food. Meanwhile, the encroaches will devour any carried food supplies that are not perfectly sealed. Any character who has housed encroaches for an hour or more will have 1-10 encroach eggs laid on his or her person, clothes, or gear. These eggs will hatch in two days, producing new encroaches ready to mate and start a new colony. The eggs will inevitably be in an inaccessible location (if that is in any way possible), but they can be killed with a fresher or energy bath, or disposed of by leaving the gear behind.

Androids were considered primitive and antiquated by the super-science metrics of the Ancient Ones, as their primary utility had been largely superseded by the use of soft-light and hard-light holograms. Still, there were times and places where economics favored the use of the ever-sturdy android. Thus, many were still in use at the time of the Great Disaster.  They are especially prevalent in areas where holograms can not be deployed. All androids have a limited amount of memory storage space, so they can effectively be taught in only one field of endeavour. They have been made sensitive to certain sonics frequencies so that they are easily damaged by them. They are powered by energy from energy cells.  The usefulness of this of creation is obvious. They can be made to have great strength; can be made to be very small and thus fit in places an engineering robot cannot enter. They can be made radiation resistant so that they can operate in areas where even a man in a suit would be in danger for any length of time. The medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for 24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks. Lack of energy after 24 hours will cause the android to hibernate until energy is restored.",HD 9D4,HD 9D4,23,hp 23 each,9,"Android 'Thinker' (1d4 (2)): Init +6; atk weapon melee +3 (1d4+1); AC 11; HD 9D4 hp 23 each; MV 30' ; 1d20+1d14; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +3",,1d4 (2),1d4,2,Collective,,/Gamma-World-Bestiary/:title:output_ext,"Android; 'Thinker';Description: Man-made beings with red hued skin and blank stares.Behavior:They generally consider humans to be their enemies, and will fight to the death.

Cruel, cunning, and sadistic, they hunt and scavenge in packs of three or more for sport and survival. Behavior:They rarely attack PSH or other mutant animals on sight. They will attack a large party, but wait until it has been softened first. Their preferred methods are ambushes, or luring the unwary into snares, pits, and deadfalls. They achieve a high degree of success by using their chameleon powers to hide out in the open while using their mental blast mutantation. Their mental blast mutation is a variant that renders the opponent confused and bewildered for 1d4+ MS rounds. At this time they will attempt to lure their prey into a trap and finish him off. They are not cowards so they check for morale once very two turns. Battle is glorious but only if they have the advantage.

A bludgeon tail instead of a stinger, and a lizard like head that weaves back and forth on a thick muscular neck.  They are usually colored an oily blue when they are not camouglaged.  They have the intelligence and ability to cover themselves with their surroundings for their own safety or to trap prey.Behavior:The Vene'a'mub only attacks when hungry or if walked on, a common occurrence considering its camouflage abilities.  It is also able to alter its exoskeleton to be wide or thinner, thereby flattening itself.  Their favorite food is bone marrow, which it feeds on after splintering the bone of its prey with its bare hands.  Because of this, they prefer mammals, and love slightly mutated ones.  They will always attack the mutants first..  They are very curious and can be found in most climates.

Androids were considered primitive and antiquated by the super-science metrics of the Ancient Ones, as their primary utility had been largely superseded by the use of soft-light and hard-light holograms. Still, there were times and places where economics favored the use of the ever-sturdy android. Thus, many were still in use at the time of the Great Disaster.  They are especially prevalent in areas where holograms can not be deployed. All androids have a limited amount of memory storage space, so they can effectively be taught in only one field of endeavour. They have been made sensitive to certain sonics frequencies so that they are easily damaged by them. They are powered by energy from energy cells.  The usefulness of this of creation is obvious. They can be made to have great strength; can be made to be very small and thus fit in places an engineering robot cannot enter. They can be made radiation resistant so that they can operate in areas where even a man in a suit would be in danger for any length of time. The medical section of every ancient facility had been given the responsibility for the creation of these constructs.  While the process of creating new Androids can be run by androids themselves it is the usual policy humans to do this work. Each android is designed so that when it is almost the end of its life expectancy it will change color from normal human skin tones to a deep blood red color. This allows it to be recycled. The standard model is in a humanoid form and can operate for 24 hours from the energy given from the standard energy cell. The brain structure of these constructs is made to be programmable directly by computer banks.

They are carnivorous in nature, and their forelegs have developed into broad wings, which they use to swoop down on their prey. Gliders cannot truly fly, but can descend upon a victim in a silent glide that adds a +2 bonus to oppo- nents chances of being surprised (even with heightened hearing). This glide can be extended for twice as far a distance as the gliders altitude at the time it takes off; e.g., a glider starting at a height of 20 m can glide down to prey on the ground 40 m away. Gliders climb extremely well using their back legs and winged forearms, each of which has a free claw useful only for hooking into tree bark to hold position. Gliders may be found at any altitude to which trees can grow. They avoid sailing out over bodies of water, as they cannot swim. Though of animal-like intelligence, gliders rarely bother creatures which possess considerable amounts of Tech II or Tech III equipment, perhaps because they dislike the smell produced by such items.
