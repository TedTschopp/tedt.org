# The Schwaben War and the Battle of Malserheide

### Source: Meinrad Lienert, Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten, Stuttgart 1915

Once, around the end of the fifteenth century, the Swiss had fallen out with their worthy neighbors over the Rhine and Lake Constance, especially due to the good city of Constance, which both the Swabian League and the Confederates dearly wished to possess. The old bishopric city would not have been unwilling to become Swiss initially, but when the rash Confederates once overran them and sought to force them into Confederate love by might, the irate citizens of Constance broke their friendship and joined the Swabian League. This and other reasons brought about the outbreak of the so-called Schwaben War. They fought back and forth and inflicted much harm and damage on both sides, though the Swabians prettily remained behind the Rhine and Lake Constance. What aggrieved the Swiss most was when the Swabians called out \"Cow Mouths\" over the Rhine at them and started to moo and bleat upon seeing them.

When Emperor Maximilian, known as the last knight, came to the aid of the Swabian League, things looked grim for the Confederates. The Emperor wanted to force the Swiss to accept the new Imperial order and then intended to bring Graubündnerland and thereafter the Confederates under Austrian rule again. Now the Swiss quickly rose with all their banners to march against the Emperor's army, for if the Emperor's army were to win, they would face dire times as the Austrian knight Burkhardt von Randeck, a dour foe of the Swiss, had said: “I will smoke and burn in the Swiss land on that day, that God in the rainbow must blink from smoke and heat and draw his feet up.”

But the heavens heard this blasphemous speech, and the punishment followed quickly. For when the Emperor's army climbed over the mountains to first subdue the Graubündners, they and their Confederates received them so gallantly that after many fierce skirmishes and battles, the war was lost, and Switzerland and its allies from Graubünden were left to their freedoms forever.

In this war, the battle on Malserheide was especially heated. A Graubündner named Benedikt Fontana won great fame. He led the strong force of Graubündners and their Confederates. Now a long trench blocked their advance. One storm after another was driven back by the brave Tyrolean shooters standing behind the trench. When the Austrian foe also stormed in bright crowds from behind, the Swiss had to fear being overwhelmed. Then their leader, Fontana, led them into one last wild assault on the trench, and they managed to take the strongly fortified wall. Fontana stood first beyond the trench. But then a sword thrust struck him in the belly. As if paralyzed, his comrades halted for a moment when they saw their leader fall to his knees. But he rose once more, raised his sword high, and called out, clutching the ghastly wound in his belly with one hand: “Confederates, onward! Do not care about my fall. I am but one man. Today, you can save the fatherland and your free leagues as victors. But if you are defeated, your descendants face eternal bondage!” Then he collapsed dead. Now the Confederates, wild with rage and the lust for battle, leapt over the trench and utterly struck down the foe in bloody struggle.

The blasphemer, Knight von Randeck, met a strange fate. About a month earlier, he had set out from Constance with ten thousand men and had ambushed a group of Confederates in Schwaderloch. They had kept poor watch and were caught by surprise. They had to retreat fighting into the woods. Now the Randecker became so overconfident that he proposed marching directly to Zurich, the heart of the Confederacy. The leaders, however, could not agree. So, they made a mighty fire, began to cook and roast, and were in high spirits. “Hey,” said the wild Randecker, seeing how all was chaotic, “beware, the cow milkers will surely come again!”

And they came. They had retreated into the woods, where, gradually, so many Swiss joined them that there were likely about fourteen hundred. Now they tried a war trick. They spread their drummers throughout the woods and had them drum and roll from all sides, making a tremendous racket. The Swabians in their merry camp were startled, thinking a massive Confederate army was approaching. And when the Swiss broke cheering from the woods, the warriors of the Swabian League shot too high. The Confederates fell upon them, threw them back onto their guns, and into the terrible smoking campfire, so that many were singed, burned, and suffocated by the smoke and heat. When the Confederates, after a short skirmish, held the field and searched the dead, they found the wild Knight von Randeck with scorched hair and blackened by smoke lying next to the guns at the fire. With horror, they now recalled his blasphemous speech before the war.
